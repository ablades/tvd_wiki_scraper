WOMAN: Help!
MAN: Help! Help...
WOMAN: Help! Help! Help!
PARAMEDIC: Easy. Breathe slow. Dizzy is normal. And keep your foot off the ground, we're in a cold snap. Weather folks say temperature's a record low. What's your name?
STEFAN: 
PARAMEDIC: Let's take a look at you.
PARAMEDIC: Ooh, wow. Whoever you are, you are one lucky SOB. You're the first person I've met to survive a gash to the carotid.
PARAMEDIC: Hey... Take it from me-- even heroes can't save them all.
STEFAN: What'd you just call me?
PARAMEDIC: 
STEFAN: My name's Stefan Salvatore.
PARAMEDIC: And there we go! Do you know where you are, Stefan?
STEFAN: Yes... I'm in Hell.
VALERIE: They didn't know... that Rayna had stabbed Stefan. That his spirit was already trapped in the Phoenix Stone. They probably thought they were doing the world a favor.
DAMON: 
VALERIE: I'm not going anywhere with you. You could have prevented this. All you had to do was take Stefan's scar and put your brother first, for once in your life.
DAMON: Hey! I'm trying to make it right, which is why we have to find Rayna and get Stefan's soul back in his body.
VALERIE: The Stone is destroyed, Damon. And Stefan with it.
DAMON: We don't know that.
VALERIE: Yes, we do, if we have logic, and a sense of reason, and a brain.
DAMON: I see it differently, okay? If Stefan's dead, then I'm responsible. Which means I'm going to spend the rest of eternity haunted and doing penance and seeing my own self-loathing reflected in everyone else's actual loathing. And, I'm not ready for any of those things-- ergo, he's not dead. Try it my way. It's less depressing.
VALERIE: I see I've been charitable in assuming you have a brain...
DAMON: You can keep being a Debbie Downer, or you can do a locator spell and help me find Rayna. What do you say?
DAMON: Where are you going?
VALERIE: To do what you just told me to do-- without you. Invisique.
DAMON: Really? Really?
STEFAN: I don't get it. My failed attempt at being a hero, the dead bodies... What's the lesson here?
PARAMEDIC: 
STEFAN: I remember being stabbed by the Phoenix Sword, which means this is all some sort of looping nightmare, custom-made from my own psyche.
PARAMEDIC: 
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: Hey, officers! Why don't we just get on with it, huh?
PARAMEDIC: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sit down. You are not making any sense.
OFFICER: Marty Hammond?
STEFAN: No, but okay...
PARAMEDIC: That's what it says on this license.
STEFAN: I believe you, but that's not my wallet.
PARAMEDIC: 
OFFICER: Have you been drinking, sir?
STEFAN: Oh! I get it. I'm a vampire with control issues, and alcoholism is a metaphor for my bloodlust. See, now we're getting somewhere!
OFFICER: Sir, could you stand up for me?
STEFAN: Are we going to a warmer hellscape?
OFFICER: Maybe... First, I'm gonna have to ask you to walk in a straight line.
MATT: Hello?
RAYNA: Matt? I need help...
MATT: Rayna?
RAYNA: You're the only person that I trust.
MATT: You put Stefan back in the Stone?
RAYNA: Yes, but--
MATT: Then we have nothing to talk about. I did my part. I'm out.
RAYNA: You don't understand! Those bitches destroyed the Stone! He's free. They're all free.
MATT: 
MATT: Rayna? What do you mean, "free?"
VALERIE: Well? Go ahead and answer him. What do you mean, "free?"
VALERIE: 
DAMON: Valerie, I don't know why you took Stefan's body, but if anything happens to...
DAMON: ...My brother? Never mind.
OFFICER: Nice work, Marty. And back to me.
RAYNA: I can hear them... All the voices...
VALERIE: What are you talking about?
RAYNA: 
STEFAN: What is this supposed to prove?
OFFICER: That you were under the influence when you were driving the bus.
STEFAN: What did you say?
RAYNA: When you destroyed the Phoenix Stone, all the souls inside escaped. Scattered. And I can hear them. Alive. Every one of them.
VALERIE: 
OFFICER: What the hell happened to you?
STEFAN: 
OFFICER: 
STEFAN: 
RAYNA: I burned all their original bodies, which means the Stone's prisoners are in random corpses. Vampire, human... it doesn't matter. The spirits fled, scatter-shot into the first dead piece of flesh they could find.
DAMON: Remember anything?
: No. Nothing.
: I'm sorry, do I know you?
VALERIE: I don't give a damn about a bunch of old vampire souls! Where did Stefan end up?
OFFICER: Here you go.
MARTY: And what if I refuse to take the test?
OFFICER: Then you're not giving me much of a choice.
VALERIE: Rayna-- where did Stefan go?
RAYNA: He could be anywhere. He could be anyone.
OFFICER: Marty Hammond, you're under arrest for driving under the influence--
MARTY: My name is Stefan.
OFFICER: Stop. Calm down!
OFFICER: Calm down, Marty...
MARTY: My name is Stefan, damnit!
OFFICER: All right, you asked for it--
OFFICER: Hey! Get back here! Stop! STOP!
BROADCASTER: 
ALARIC: What the hell do you want?
MATT: I'm calling to warn you--
ALARIC: 
MATT: I know you're gonna find this hard to believe, but I made sure that Caroline was safe.
ALARIC: 
MATT: 
ALARIC: What the hell happened to you, man?
MATT: Look, something bad happened, and I'm calling to warn you that I sent some visitors your way.
ALARIC: No! No, listen-- Caroline is in hiding with the girls, waiting for me.
MATT: 
ALARIC: 
VALERIE: It's like what happened with Jo, only more random. All the vampire souls from the Phoenix Stone have found fresh corpses to inhabit. Some vampires, some not.
ALARIC: 
VALERIE: Stefan is among the missing, and something tells me that your household has a vested interest in whether he lives or dies.
ALARIC: Okay. What do we need to do?
RAYNA: We have to hunt them all down.
VALERIE: 
RAYNA: Your boyfriend should be the least of your concerns.
ALARIC: 
RAYNA: You think I spent my life chasing harmless do-gooders? That stone was made for the worst of the worst. I've put down some of the most evil vampires of the last two hundred years.
DAMON: Here. Flip through that.
: What is this?
DAMON: It's your journal. See if anything jogs your memory.
: "Day 57 of being pissed off at my garbage-heap of a brother..."
DAMON: 
DAMON: Look, the most important thing is, man-- you're not in that Hell, all right? This is real.
DAMON: And look, man, the truth is, you have every right to be pissed at me, okay? I screwed up bad, and when you remember why, I do not blame you--
: 
DAMON: Yeah?
: 
WAITRESS: Okay, there you go. Need a refill?
AMBROSE: 
DAMON: Okay, I think that's enough, Stefan.
DAMON: That's enough.
AMBROSE: Care to take her for a spin?
DAMON: Better go make a quick phone call.
ALARIC: 
DAMON: 
ALARIC: Listen, are you with your brother right now?
DAMON: 
ALARIC: 
VALERIE: Keep him close. We're going to need his body.
DAMON: 
ALARIC: Uh, you know, it's not easy to pick him out from hundreds of Twitter reports about the zombie apocalypse, okay? We're working on it.
DAMON: Work harder. I don't want to spend the rest of my life babysitting a cheap knockoff of my brother.
ALARIC: Oh, trust me, it's not gonna be the rest of your life. Jo's body started to break down just as soon as that vampire soul inhabited her body.
DAMON: 
ALARIC: 
STEFAN: Ah, yes!
STEFAN: Ah-ha!
BROADCASTER: 
OFFICER: 
OFFICER: 
BROADCASTER: 
BROADCASTER: 
RAYNA: 
VALERIE: Tell me... What are they like? The voices?
RAYNA: 
VALERIE: 
RAYNA: 
VALERIE: Do you have any pictures of Stefan?
ALARIC: 
VALERIE: Not you. Caroline. Now, don't tell me she hasn't got some bloody sentimental keepsake.
RAYNA: 
VALERIE: Giving you something to focus on while I help you sort through the noise.
ALARIC: Here. Will this do?
VALERIE: It's perfect.
ALARIC: Okay.
VALERIE: Here. Look into his eyes. Concentrate.
RAYNA: 
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: 
ALARIC: Wait, an anchor?
VALERIE: A tattoo on his hand. He's hurt. He's scared.
BROADCASTER: 
VALERIE: I saw a burning bus. A merchant marine tattoo, a guy who saves a bunch of kids and then goes on the lam... I think this Marty Hammond is our guy.
DAMON: Arkansas? What the hell's in Arkansas?
ALARIC: Miles of national forest, dozens of pissed-off state troopers, and a rapidly approaching blizzard. How soon can you get there?
DAMON: Well, that depends on how cooperative my passenger's gonna be.
DAMON: All right, brother. Time to go.
AMBROSE: Not a minute too soon! This place is dead.
DAMON: Yeah. Come on.
STEFAN: Oh, of course. Of course I'm stuck in the body of an addict. Didn't need a damn Hell-stone to hammer that irony home, did we, Marty? You know, Marty, I spent the last three years knowing my life span was tied to Rayna's. After the initial shock wore off, I actually started to enjoy it. I had an expiration date. That's as close to being human as I was ever gonna get. I guess I forgot how much being a human actually sucks. How everything hurts... all the damn time.
STEFAN: Ah, come on... Ugh, come on!
STEFAN: Yes! Yes! Suck on that, you miserable drunk.
AMBROSE: Yes. Yes, I think it's starting to come back to me. The pain, the doleful humdrum of my eternal curse. And yet, here and there, moments of hope. Glimmers of humanity. I may have forgotten what you've done, Damon, but I do remember this-- you are my blood. I love you, brother.
DAMON: 
AMBROSE: Oh, that's a shame. I was just warming up!
DAMON: I give you points for being a quick study.
AMBROSE: I can't take all the credit. You did give me the handbook. In all seriousness, though, your brother truly, truly hates you. Listen to this-- "I have resigned myself to never seeing Damon again in my now-finite lifetime, and I have never felt so unburdened." Oof! Sounds like he doesn't care if he ever sees you again. Which is perfect, because I don't plan on giving up this body.
DAMON: Well, fair warning, that hair requires a tremendous amount of maintenance.
AMBROSE: 
DAMON: 
AMBROSE: You seem like an entertaining fellow, Damon. Well... When this is all over, we should go carousing together. Deuces.
DAMON: WAIT!
ALARIC: 
DAMON: 
ALARIC: Memphis? We're two states away from Memphis.
DAMON: And I have to rescue the real Stefan from a manhunt. You have a Heretic and a Huntress. Use them.
VALERIE: It's okay. I can track Stefan's body.
RAYNA: Did you say Memphis? We have to catch him.
ALARIC: 
VALERIE: And then what? And then kill him? That's what you're not saying. Who is he?
RAYNA: Just another serial killer that cannot be allowed to walk this earth. He should be staked and burned and sent to oblivion.
VALERIE: Well, he is walking this earth in my boyfriend's body, so we're not killing anyone.
RAYNA: Then this is where we part ways.
RAYNA: 
ALARIC: 
RAYNA: Think it'll help?
STEFAN: Excuse me, miss? Do you know where we are?
WOMAN: Are you lost?
STEFAN: 
WOMAN: Hang on.
REPORTER: 
WOMAN: Get away from me!
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Pardon me. Excuse me. Officer coming through.
CAPTAIN: I need you to call these four guys back for another shift. I need the manpower.
CAPTAIN: Hold on, I'll be right back.
CAPTAIN: Sir? Sir? Who are you?
DAMON: I'm a volunteer. Deputy Matt Donovan, Mystic Falls. A friend to my brothers in blue.
CAPTAIN: 
DAMON: 
CAPTAIN: Glad you're here, Donovan. We're lucky to have you.
DAMON: So, what's the status?
CAPTAIN: Well, Hammond is screwed any way you cut it. We got the forest surrounded. Boys just raided a cabin. Found traces of blood, but no Marty, which means that...
DAMON: 
CAPTAIN: And nobody can survive these temperatures overnight. We're just laying low. Gonna wait for nature to do our work for us.
DAMON: Didn't think that one through, did you, brother? What do you say we get out of here, get you back in your own body? Let's go.
DAMON: What? What's wrong?
STEFAN: This. You. If you're here, then I'm safe, and I owe you one.
STEFAN: But, if you're a hallucination, then I've entered the delirium phase of my withdrawal, which means I am officially and royally screwed.
REPORTER: 12 degrees and dropping fast. With snowfall of a foot or more projected, road closures and downed power lines should be anticipated.
CAPTAIN: All right. Try to calm down and tell me what happened.
WOMAN: I saw him. He attacked me.
CAPTAIN: Hey, you're safe now, ma'am.
WOMAN: 
DAMON: If it's okay with you, Captain, I'd like to question her myself.
CAPTAIN: All right.
CAPTAIN: All right, everyone. Matt Donovan's got this.
DAMON: I need you to tell me exactly where you saw him.
WOMAN: Yeah, it was an access road off of 274. It was north of Oden. There's an outlook there.
DAMON: And you're sure it was north?
WOMAN: 
DAMON: Okay. All right, boys. He's south of Oden. Let's pull all troops down to that area, okay?
WOMAN: Wait, that's not what I said...
DAMON: 
WOMAN: Hey, let me know if they find my phone.
DAMON: What did you say?
WOMAN: My cell phone...
STEFAN: Hello?
DAMON: Wow. Marty's voice is, uh, huskier than I imagined.
STEFAN: Damon?
DAMON: Sure picked a great night to get lost in the woods.
STEFAN: Yeah, well, at least I'm starting to warm up. Which, in case you didn't know, is a bad sign.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Alone in the wilderness, trapped in the frozen corpse of an alcoholic murderer? Uh, I don't know... Seems kind of fitting to me.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Day late and a dollar short. You suck at playing hero, brother.
DAMON: Well, I guess I'm just not used to you being such a damsel in distress.
STEFAN: Should I list all the ways in which this mess is your fault?
DAMON: 
STEFAN: You bailed on me, Damon.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Even before that. You bailed on me when you decided you'd rather live in a coffin than own up to your mistakes.
DAMON: No. No, no, I was trying to prevent myself from making mistakes, Stefan.
STEFAN: And why is that so hard for you, Damon? Don't say "Elena." You lived 160 years before you met her. I got ripped out of hell and thrown into a dead man's body, and do you know what my first thought was when I came to? "I need to save those people on the bus." I didn't know who I was, I didn't know where I was... it was my instinct. What are your instincts, Damon? What does the voice in your head say?
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: My brother included. You mad?
STEFAN: Yes.
DAMON: You resent me?
STEFAN: Yes.
DAMON: Good. Then get up and come kick my ass yourself.
DAMON: Stefan...?
STEFAN: I'm walking.
STEFAN: You want to know why this is so hard?
DAMON: Because Marty Hammond is a total train-wreck?
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: 
ALARIC: 
VALERIE: How convenient for you.
ALARIC: What's that supposed to mean?
VALERIE: Well, if this ends badly, you emerge the victor. Stefan dies through no fault of your own-- less competition for your fiancée's heart.
ALARIC: Oh wow. How insecure do you think I am?
VALERIE: Don't pretend it hasn't crossed your mind. I am very familiar with the sensation of watching Stefan and Caroline from the outside.
ALARIC: 
VALERIE: You see, I never fooled myself into thinking that what I had with Stefan would last. But you? You put a ring on it.
ALARIC: Yeah, I proposed to Caroline, because I fell in love with her. And she said yes because it made sense for the kids. So yeah, Stefan coming back might ruin my perfect little life. So what?
VALERIE: 
ALARIC: Why, how selfless of you.
DAMON: Ah, don't tell me you don't appreciate the irony of this? You being human?
STEFAN: Well, safe to say I do not appreciate it at this particular moment.
DAMON: Tell me, though-- what's the worst part about being human? Is it... Is it leg cramps? Is it sniffles? Frostbite? What is it?
STEFAN: How about the inability to compel people?
DAMON: Ooh, yeah! Yeah, that's a big one. Sucks having to play by the rules, doesn't it?
STEFAN: 
DAMON: You bring that up because you used to cheat?
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Absolutely, you did. You used to hide in Father's office, even though we weren't allowed to be in there.
STEFAN: Once, maybe.
DAMON: No. All the time.
STEFAN: Then why was it so hard for you to find me?
DAMON: 'Cause I was scared. I didn't want to break the rules.
STEFAN: Maybe you were hoping Father would catch me and punish me.
DAMON: No. I wasn't scared I'd get caught-- I was scared for you, Stefan.
DAMON: Why do you bring up hide-and-go-seek?
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: Damon...? What's wrong?
DAMON: Nothing. It's all very normal.
STEFAN: Are those...?
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Mmmmm... You asked me what I missed most about being human? The ecstasy of eating this... incredibly crappy doughnut.
DAMON: So all's forgiven?
STEFAN: Not by a long shot.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: About that... I'm afraid Marty's not gonna make it.
DAMON: Buckle up. We have less than 48 hours to track down your real body.
ALARIC: Are you still tracking Stefan's body?
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: I can hear music. It's... a fraternity house.
ALARIC: Wait, a-a vampire just bee-lined to Memphis and went straight to a university?
ALARIC: Okay, we gotta go.
VALERIE: 
ALARIC: 
ALARIC: 
AMBROSE: Libations?
BROTHER: Nice! Come on in, man.
ALARIC: 
ALARIC: 
ALARIC: 
ALARIC: They never caught the killer.
