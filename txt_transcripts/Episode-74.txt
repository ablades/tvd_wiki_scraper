Salvatore Boarding House




Damon: Elena?




Elena: Hey.

Damon: Hey.




Damon: Thought you might've left.

Elena: No I don't have to be at school for....
 At least twenty minutes ago. 
 What's that face?

Damon: What face? 


Elena: That face.

Damon: I'm happy.




Forbes Residence

Caroline: This is a disaster!

Stefan: Look, we don't know anything for sure.

Caroline: Yes we do! Elena is sired to Damon! Which means her one singular burning desire is to make him happy, just like Klaus and his hybrids!

Stefan: No it's not. A vampire sired to another vampire is one in a million. Maybe it won't affect her the same way.

Salvatore Boarding House




Forbes Residence

Caroline: We already know it's affecting her. She's become Damon's lapdog. 
 It's true! Everything he says, she agrees with. Everything he asks her to do...she does.

Salvatore Boarding House




Forbes Residence

Caroline: We need to do something.




Stefan: Wait, no, hold on Caroline. 
 This isn't gossip. You can't just drop this on her before we know what's happening for sure.

Caroline: I need to talk to Tyler, okay? Maybe he'll know what to do.

Stefan: All right talk to Tyler but please don't tell anyone else. If this is true, then it may have influence on Elena's every action and emotion since she became a vampire.

Salvatore Boarding House




Abandoned Barn




Adrian: Please, no more, I can't.

Tyler: Yes, you can. Block out the pain.




Kimberley: That's enough. This is torture.

Hayley: Kim, stop. He needs to finish.

Kimberley: Not today, he doesn't. 


Hayley: Yes, today. Nate, Dean, and Chris are all dead, which makes Adrian Klaus' right hand. We can't let Adrian anywhere near Klaus until his sire bond is completely broken.

Tyler: Hayley is right. The bond isn't broken until he doesn't feel the pain of transformation anymore. If we want to get back at Klaus for everything he's done to us, Adrian has to keep turning.

Kimberley: He doesn't have to do anything. Isn't that the point of breaking the sire bond -- free will? 
 Let's go Adrian. 


Salvatore Boarding House




Damon: Bag?

Elena: I got it. Ahem.




Damon: Scarf.




Elena: What - oh! 
 Mm. Hmm. 
 Listen, Damon, we....

Damon: No. No, no no. Don't ruin it.




Elena: You didn't even know what I was gonna say.

Damon: Well, I'm assuming it starts with, "What are we?" And then ends with, "Going to tell Stefan?"

Elena: He should know.

Damon: I know he should know. I just don't know when he should know it.

Elena: Well, he knows that something is going on between us. I mean, it's the reason that he and I broke up.

Damon: Yeah, but can't we just let ourselves enjoy one secret, selfish day before we destroy his?

Elena: Maybe we shouldn't --

Damon: No, Elena. This is our time. It's never been right before but it is right now. Just one day? One day?




Elena: 
 OK, one day.

Damon: Yes.




Elena: Hey.

Stefan: Hey.




Elena: See you in history?

Stefan: Yeah.




Damon: Hey.

Stefan: Hey.




Stefan: Listen, we need to talk.




Damon: Sired? Really Stefan? That is the most pathetic nonsense I've ever heard come out of your mouth, and you've said some crap in your day.

Stefan: It was your blood that turned her, right? I mean, she's been different from day one because of you. You can't deny that.

Damon: Sure I can. I finally got Elena to a good place about being a vampire. You two idiots can't stand that she's happy because of me.

Stefan: All right. You know what? Prove me wrong. Tell her it's OK to drink from a blood bag.

Damon: She can't. Her weird doppelgänger body rejected the blood from the bag.

Stefan: Right, because you told her to. You said she had to drink warm human blood straight from the vein. She almost died to make you happy. 
 Look, just ask her to drink from a blood bag. Make sure you'll tell her how happy you'll be if it works, and if I'm wrong, I'll be the first to apologize.

Damon: When her body rejects this blood, which it will, your apology better be epic.




Mystic Falls High School




Bonnie: Elena, hey. Is everything okay?

Elena: Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

Bonnie: Well, Caroline told me you had to move out to stay away from Jeremy.

Elena: Matt is at the house staying with him right now to make sure he keeps all of his hunter stuff in control. He's OK.

Caroline: But are you? I mean, clearly, they don't have a flat iron at hotel Salvatore. 


Elena: Oh -- I was in a rush. I mean -- look, do you girls have any plans tonight? I'm in desperate need of some girl talk. 


Bonnie: I'm in. Shane taught me some small spells I've been wanting to try.

Caroline: Oh, creepy professor guy is just Shane now.

Bonnie: He's not creepy.

Elena: We're not judging.

Caroline: I am.

Elena: Don't listen to her. So, girls' night? We can raid the Salvatore wine cellar.

Caroline: 
 Um, are you sure that Stefan and Damon are cool with us crashing at their place?

Elena: 
 I can't go home because my brother is trying to kill me. So their place is mine now, too. I'll see you in a bit.




Elena: You being here makes your selfish, secret day a little difficult, don't you think?




Damon: Forgot your lunch.

Elena: I can't. You know I can't.

Damon: Well, last time you tried it, the circumstances were less optimal and I think maybe you should just give it another try, see if it works. I really think it will. 
 Please...for me?




Damon: Are you okay?

Elena: 
 Mm, I'm fine. It tastes like blood. Last time, it was like hot garbage. 


Damon: You sure you're okay?

Elena: 
 I'm better than OK. I mean, maybe last time, it was a bad batch or something. I can't believe this, Damon. I don't have to hurt people anymore. 
 I have to get to class. Thank you. 


Professor Shane's Office




Prof. Shane: Trespassing, breaking, and entering all before noon?

Hayley: Having trouble breaking Adrian.

Prof. Shane: Don't worry about it. You already got the twelve hybrids I need.

Hayley: We have eleven. I told you, Tyler Lockwood isn't part of the deal.

Prof. Shane: Well, now there's eleven hybrids. You deliver me twelve without loyalties to Klaus or your friend Tyler becomes fair game.

Hayley: You haven't held up you end of the bargain.

Prof. Shane: Right. 
 This is everything you always wanted to know about your biological parents. And it's encoded in case you're thinking of a smash-and-grab. Just bring me twelve unsired hybrids and it's yours.

Salvatore Boarding House




Caroline: I talked to Tyler.

Stefan: And?

Caroline: The sire bond exists because the hybrids are grateful to Klaus for relieving them from the pain of having to wolf out every full moon, and that's why they have to turn until they're not ruled by the pain anymore. 


Stefan: Right, but Elena's not a werewolf so what's the vampire equivalent?

Caroline: Well, that's the problem. There isn't one.




Stefan: What are you doing?

Damon: Elena is sired. You were right, I was wrong. Happy?

Stefan: No, I'm not happy. But what are we gonna do about it?

Damon: Well, I'm working on it. Here.




Damon: Remember that?




Stefan: New Orleans.

Damon: 1942, to be exact.

Stefan: 
 What was in New Orleans in 1942?

Damon: Other than bourbon and beads...
 Us, Stefan.

Stefan: Oh yeah. 
 What was the name of that girl you used to hang out with?

Damon: That was no ordinary girl. That was Charlotte.

New Orleans 1942




Damon: 
 She was crazy about me from the minute we met. So, of course, when she asked me to turn her, I did.




Damon: Hi.

Charlotte: Hi.

Damon: So, did you decide who you would like to have for dinner tonight?

Charlotte: 
 Him. He looks tasty.

Damon: That's a very fine choice, Miss Charlotte. I will go set that up. Now, if anyone tries to touch my drink, you show them no mercy, OK? 





Charlotte: You spilled my man's drink.

Sailor: Sorry. 
 It's crowded in here.

Charlotte: That's no excuse.

Sailor: Hey, take it easy, lady.

Charlotte: I'm not gonna take it easy.

Sailor: What?




Damon: 
 What did you do?

Charlotte: He touched your drink. You said show no mercy. I thought you'd be happy.

Salvatore Boarding House

Damon: That was my first clue.

Stefan: She was sired to you, and I can only assume you took full advantage of that until you got bored of her, right?

Damon: More like when she went all "Fatal Attraction" on me, then I had to make a clean break.

Stefan: How'd you do that?

Damon: 
 Ah, phew, here. 


Stefan: Who's Valerie LaMarche?

Damon: The witch that I found to help me break little Charlotte's sire bond. 
 Pack your bags, baby bro. We're going back to Bourbon Street. 





Elena: One for you.




Elena: One for you.




Caroline: Ooh.

Bonnie: I'm assuming this is for Caroline.




Elena: Actually, it's for me.




Caroline: I thought --

Bonnie: Oh. Are you saying that --




Elena: Thanks to Damon, I am now a functional dysfunctional vampire.

Bonnie: That's amazing.

Caroline: Uh, what do you mean "thanks to Damon?"

Elena: Well, he suggested that I try it again. So I did and it worked. No more snatch, eat, erase.

Caroline: So where is my least-favorite Salvatore?




Elena: "Out with Stefan for the night, don't wait up. Brother bonding."

Caroline: Hm, so you guys check-in text now? What else do you do?

Elena: I know that you're not the biggest fan, but he kind of just changed my life. Would you mind laying off on all the hate?




Bonnie: OK, new girls' night rule -- no boy talk, yeah? Plus, why talk when we have this?




Caroline: Is that stoner tea?!

Bonnie: It's spirit tea. It opens up your chi, or whatever. 
 Come on, it's not drugs! Shane is helping me do natural magic without having to access the spirits.

Caroline: Mm-hmm.

Bonnie: Don't judge.

Caroline: 
 OK, fine! I hereby vow not to be judgmental for the rest of the evening! Even if you two are potentially ruining your lives as I stand idly by, it's your choice.

Elena: 
 I'll drink to that. 
 Cheers.

New Orleans




Stefan: Well, the city is the same. Just brighter.

Damon: Have you been back here since '42?

Stefan: Nope, not since I shipped off to join the war effort and you didn't.

Damon: Somebody had to entertain the ladies who had been left by their menfolk. 
 Hey, good news. Elena is at the house with the girls where she can't get in trouble. Bad news -- I think they got into the Dom. Told her to make herself at home.

Stefan: 
 Yeah, you told her so she does, right?

Damon: 
 Sire bond is not that literal, Stefan.

Stefan: 
 Really? Name one thing that you've asked her to do that you haven't gotten, huh? 


Damon: You know what I haven't gotten? Blame, guilt. I get it Stefan. I get that your pissed that Elena dumped you because she has feelings for me. Bet you blame the sire bond for that, too.

Stefan: Yeah, you know what? I absolutely do.

Damon: Why, because it's impossible to think she could have feelings for me?

Stefan: No, because it's impossible for her to be so blind that she doesn't see how wrong you are for her. 
 Hey, wait, Damon, I'm sorry.




Damon: What'd you say?

New Orleans 1942




Stefan: "I'm sorry, I blamed you for my bloodlust and for me becoming a ripper. It wasn't your fault." 
 Do I really have to say it wasn't his fault, Lexi?

Lexi: Yes, keep going. 


Stefan: "You're the only brother I have and I hope that we can be friends again."

Lexi: Perfect. Now, just remember we're here to talk to Damon, not to yell, not to drudge up the past and most definitely not to pick a fight.

Stefan: That's the real trick, isn't it?

Lexi: You've spent the last twenty years turning your life around. It's time to make nice with your brother.




Damon: You look like a guy I used to know.

Stefan: Hello, Damon.

Damon: Come to put a stake in my heart?

Stefan: More like bury the hatchet.






Damon: Egypt, ha! Finally gonna get to see the pyramids.

Stefan: Oh, I doubt I'll be doing much sightseeing. Driving an ambulence through the front lines, but yeah, yeah, Egypt.

Damon: Think they have room for another driver? 
 I could handle some war, if it meant spending quality time with my little brother. 


Stefan: Tell you what, I'll talk to my CO. 
 I'm gonna get us another round. 


Lexi: You're not going.

Damon: I don't like you.

Lexi: In 1912, you pressured Stefan to drink human blood. He's been trying to put his ripper days behind him, but he needs to see death and blood and deal with them as part of life. He needs balance, restraint.

Damon: What makes you think I'm not balanced and restrained?

Lexi: The fact that you never have been. You think of what you want, first, second and third. Stefan is better off alone than in your company.

Damon: Well, I beg to differ.




Stefan: To the Salvatores in Eygpt!




Charlotte: Damon. 
 Did you forget you were supposed to meet us for dinner?

Damon: Sorry, I lost track of time.

Charlotte: I brought you leftovers.




Damon: Charlotte!




Lexi: Get away from him!

Damon: Stefan!




Damon: Stefan.




Stefan: I -- I --

Damon: Stefan?




Damon: Stefan.




Lexi: She's better off without you, too.




New Orleans




Stefan: I apologize, all right? As much as I hate this sire bond thing, I shouldn't take it out on you. It's not really your fault.

Damon: Well, dont get all warm and fuzzy on me yet. 
 It's where the witch lived.

Stefan: What, you weren't expecting to find the same exact witch in the same place?

Damon: No, but since I couldn't remember where the store was, figured it'd give us a start.

Stefan: Maybe there's another place to start. You think Charlotte might be in New Orleans?

Damon: Yeah, maybe.

Stefan: Where was the last place you saw her?

Damon: Corner of Bourbon and Dumaine. Kind of told her to count every brick in every building in New Orleans, and I'd meet her at the corner. 
 I was gone by morning.




Damon: Where you going?




Stefan: Corner of Bourbon and Dumaine. See how literal the sire bond is.




Mystic Grill




Hayley: They are gonna get us both killed and we are just sitting here.

Tyler: Kim is right. The point of breaking the sire bond is being free. They dont have to listen to me.

Hayley: Yes they do, Ty. You can make them. Hybrids are werewolves first. Wolves run in packs and every pack needs an Alpha or they end up challenging each other for dominance. Kim is challenging your position as Alpha. You need to put her in her place. Now.




Tyler: Long day tomorrow Adrian. You want it to go better than today, you need to get some rest.




Kimberley: Who do you think you are?

Tyler: The guy telling you to call it a night.




Tyler: This could get a lot uglier right now but I'm not gonna let it. Challenge me again, this conversation will end differently. You understand?

Kimberley: Fine. Whatever you say.

Tyler: Finish your drink and get Adrian back to the stables. We'll meet you there.




Adrian: Where are we going?

Kimberley: To pick a fight.




New Orleans




Damon: There's no way she's gonna be in the same spot after seventy years.

Stefan: So, what are we gonna tell Elena?

Damon: I was hoping we wouldn't have to tell her anything.

Stefan: 
 Well, we can't just lie to her.

Damon: It's not a lie. It's an omission for the greater good.

Stefan: Oh, I see. I see.That's Damon speak for "Let's not do the right thing, let's just do what's right for me."

Damon: Oh, what about you, O selfless one? Are you doing what's best for Elena or what's best for you? Because it looks to me like the only reason you want to break Elena's sire bond is to restore her original factory "Team Stefan" settings.




Damon: I'm gonna go get a drink. Hunt me down when you stop being a dick.




Stefan: What the hell just happened?

Damon: She kissed me.




Charlotte: Damon, I always knew you'd come back for me. I must have counted literally every brick on every building in all of New Orleans.




Stefan: Literally every brick?




Damon: Uh, Charlotte, uh. Ha.




Damon: Please tell me you had a full life and that you've done something other than counting bricks.

Charlotte: Of course I have, I'm not crazy.




Stefan: Then why are you still here?




Charlotte: You know when someone breaks up with you and there's a song that reminds you of them? First, you hate it.




Charlotte: But then it brings back all the good memories of them. Counting the bricks is my song and I've been playing it for decades.

Stefan: 
 That's a really long time stuck listening to the same song.




Damon: Yeah, heh..




Damon: Well you know, in the plus column, you know New Orleans better than anyone in the world. Which is really nice, because we need your help finding someone.

Salvatore Boarding House






Bonnie: Check this out: Vamp-speed video.




Elena: 
 I look like Superman. Watch this. 
 This year's Christmas card. 
 Being a vampire is so weird. Oh my God, I love this bathtub. Why don't we come and hang out here more often?

Caroline: I'll tell you why. Cooties. Think of all the germ-ridden skanks that Damon has lured into his den of enequity.




Caroline: Okay, I'm sorry. I've been good all night. I am stopping now.

Elena: 
 No, don't stop on my account. Rip away. I mean, it's only Damon, right?

Caroline: Well, say what you want about Ripper Stefan, but at least he wasn't a man slut.

Bonnie: Come on.

Elena: So, what exactly was it about him that made you jump right into bed with him as soon as you met him?

Caroline: I didn't know what a sociopathic narcissist he was.

Elena: He's always been there for me when I needed him.

Caroline: Yeah, because he's hoping you'll sleep with him.

Elena: Well, maybe I did.




Caroline: You did what?!

Bonnie: You didn't.

Elena: Yeah, I did. Look, I know you two have issues with him, but I'm happy, and I wanted to spend tonight with my best friends so that I could tell them about it.




New Orleans




Nandi: Can I help you, gentleman?

Damon: Hi. We're looking for a witch. Sorry, no time for pleasantries.




Nandi: I'm sorry. I don't understand.

Damon: Look..
 Nandi, is it? Let's skip the part where you pretend like you don't know what we're talking about. 
 We need a spell that could break a vampire sire bond. Now, there was a witch here named Val. Ring any bells?

Nandi: She was my great-grandmother.

Damon: She had a grimoire and it had a spell.




Val: The magic you are talking about is dark, powerful. Magic like this doesn't come cheap.




Damon: How much?

Val: Money won't cut it here, pretty one. Dark magic draws power from dark places. Casting the spell you need requires the sacrifice of 12 human souls.




Stefan: A sacrifice? You brought me here knowing that the spell required a human sacrifice.

Damon: Well, I was hoping the recipe had changed.

Nandi: Look, there's no magic like that here. I sell herbs and homeopathic remedies and dress it up with a little witchy-woo-woo for the tourists, but I don't practice.

Damon: Okay, fine, listen, just tell us where we can find someone like your great-grandma who can break the sire bond and won't flake out on us like old Val did.

Nandi: There's no one. All of her stuff is gone - the grimoires, her journals. We lost it all during Katrina. If a spell like that ever existed, it's gone for good.

Salvatore Boarding House




Bonnie: Elena, come on.

Elena: Party is over. You guys need to leave.

Caroline: Don't be mad, okay? We're just looking out for you.




Elena: Do you think it makes me happy that you guys hate him? I get it. His track record has been kind of spotty but I don't hate him. I can't. He's - I think I'm falling in love with him.

Caroline: Ugh, you're not falling in love with him, Elena. You're sired to him.




Bonnie: What?

Elena: What are you talking about?




Caroline: I...Look, I'm sorry that it came out like that, but it's true. Damon's blood turned you. You couldn't feed from animals or blood bags because he told you so. Then he suggested that you try again with blood bags and suddenly...

Elena: No. There's no way, I...

Bonnie: 
 Are you sure?

Caroline: Yeah. Ask Stefan about it. He can explain it better than I can.

Elena: 
 I'm sorry, you talked to Stefan about this?

Caroline: It's not your fault, Elena. Okay, Damon took advantage of you.

Elena: 
 Okay, you need to leave.




Elena: Now!




Bonnie: Elena!

Caroline: Come on!

Elena: I said leave.




Kimberley: Hello girls.




Kimberley: Stop!




Kimberley: One bite from a hybrid and she's dead, remember?




Elena: Caroline?




New Orleans




Damon: Witch is lying. Doesn't practice magic, my ass.

Stefan: Human sacrifice? Did you really think I would go for this?




Damon: Extreme circumstances call for extreme measures.

Stefan: Did you kill those 12 people in 1942?

Damon: Absolutely, I did, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat if it meant a clean slate with Elena.

Stefan: Hmm.

Damon: Are you gonna help me good cop/bad cop this witch or not?

Woods




Tyler: I get it, Hayley. I'll find them and I'll get them in line.




Elena: Bonnie says no luck with the locater spell.

Tyler: They've gotta be here. They're not dumb enough to risk getting caught by Klaus in town.

Elena: Well, what do they want with Caroline?




Tyler: Kim is trying to prove that she's the Alpha. If I can make her submit, the pack will fall in line and we can finally get them free of Klaus. You'd think they'd play along with how much they hate him.

Elena: But Adrian doesn't, does he? I mean he's still sired to Klaus.

Tyler: Being sired doesn't mean you feel differently about someone. I hated Klaus but I still did everything he said. The bond affects how you act, not how you feel.




Tyler: Caroline.




New Orleans




Nandi: What are you doing here?

Damon: Calling you out. You're not Val's great-granddaughter. You're her daughter.




Damon: You're 80 years old. You don't look a day over 50. You're a practicing witch.

Nandi: Get out of my store.

Damon: Give me what I want.




Nandi: I gave you a chance to leave with your life.




Stefan: Wait, wait, wait, wait. We don't want any trouble okay? We just - we just need your help. That's all.

Nandi: I told you there's no one here who can help you. The kind of magic my mother practiced, it's unnatural. Witches don't even call it magic. We call it expression.




Stefan: Is that like black magic?

Nandi: Worse. Channeling the power of human sacrifices calls on darkness that can't exist on this plane without swallowing it whole. She sold you a bill of goods about breaking the sire bond because she wanted access to that power and you gave it to her when you killed those twelve people.




Damon: Are you saying there's no spell?

Nandi: The bond can't be broken with magic. A vampire only bonds to her sire when she has feelings for him before she turns, human feelings. Vampirism only heightens those emotions. You want her free? You have to set her free. Tell her to live her life without you and never think of you again, to stop caring about you, and then leave her. That's the only way around the sire bond.

Stable




Caroline: Arghh. Why are you doing this?

Kimberley: To show Tyler who's in charge.




Tyler: Stop! Stop it, Kim. Caroline's with us. All right? We're all on the same team.

Kimberley: She's on your team, not mine.




Tyler: Stop it! Stop!

Adrian: Ease up, Kim. Klaus won't like this.

Kimberley: That's a very good point. Do you think he'll like this?




Tyler: Kim! Don't do it. I swear to God!




Elena: No, wait, wait, wait, wait. If you really want to hit Klaus where it hurts, then torture me instead. He's fixated on keeping me alive. You want real revenge or not?




Tyler: Stay back! I'll rip her heart out right now!




Tyler: Kim put you all at risk today but I'm not gonna hurt her. I'm not Klaus. I don't kill and torture my own friends to get what I want. Now, we broke the sire bond, but if you want to be free we have to work together. No one can step out of line. Now, you're either with me or you're against me. Submit. Submit or you die.




Kimberley: I'm....I'm sorry.




New Orleans




Charlotte: So, you're just leaving me again?

Damon: No, I need to get on with my life and so do you.

Charlotte: I don't want to live without you.

Damon: If you want to make me happy you will. You just forget about me. You'll never think of me again, and you'll find someone new, and you'll be happier than ever.




Damon: Please, stop crying.




Charlotte: I'm never gonna be able to forget about you.

Damon: Yes, you are. And I'm never gonna be happy until you realize that you're never gonna have the life that you deserve if I'm in it. 
 Goodbye, Charlotte.




Stefan: How'd it go?

Damon: I set her free.

Stefan: Must've been hard. Doing the right thing, especially when it's not something you want to do.

Damon: Get to the point, Stefan. You don't think I'm gonna be able to do what I need to when I have to tell Elena to stay away from me.

Stefan: Well, I mean, selflessness isn't exactly one of your most obvious character traits, Damon.

Damon: Yeah? Well, one of these days you're gonna realize you don't know me half as well as you think.




New Orleans 1942




Lexi: Damon.




Lexi: I know what you did and you're not going overseas with Stefan. Do you understand me?

Damon: Well, Uncle Sam begs to differ.

Lexi: You just killed twelve innocent people.




Damon: How do you know they didn't have it coming?

Lexi: Your brother has spent the last twenty years racked with guilt, fighting the temptation to drink human blood. He's serving in war as penance for the pain that he has caused. If he finds out what you did, he'll want to know how it is you function without guilt for the things that you do. He'll turn to you for guidance like he did before and he'll become the Ripper of Monterrey all over again.

Damon: I've pretty much been on my own since our little falling out in 1912. Did you ever think that I just need my little brother?

Lexi: And that's why you can't go. It might be good for you, Damon. But it will destroy Stefan.




Lexi: For once, you need to put someone else in front of yourself.




Lexi: You need to let him go.




Damon: Good luck, Brother.




New Orleans




Stefan: I didn't know about that.

Damon: Yeah, well, next time I'll hang a billboard.

Stefan: Look, I know it may seem like I'm being unfair about this, like I'm upset about losing Elena to you, and I am. But after all this is over, if she never feels the same way about me as she used to, at least it'll be her choice.

Damon: The dreaded C - word.




Damon: I know what I have to do Stefan.




Salvatore Boarding House




Caroline: I'm sorry!




Caroline: Okay, if you don't start hugging me back this is gonna get really awkward really fast.

Elena: You've got my hands pinned down.

Caroline: Oh.




Caroline: I'm a jerk. I promise to never again judge ever.

Elena: Just please don't tell Stefan about me and Damon.




Elena: I promise that I'll tell him. I just - I need to figure out some stuff first.

Caroline: Of course.




Bonnie: You guys friends again? Thank God.

Caroline: Well, she saved my life. In spite of me being the nasty, bad witch.

Elena: Thankfully we had our good witch. You know, your hottie-creepy Professor really knows his stuff, Bonnie.

Bonnie: It's been baby steps but he's helping with a whole new kind of magic. He calls it expression.

Professor Shane's Office




Prof. Shane: You ever hear of a text message? Maybe just give a guy a heads up?

Hayley: Adrian finished breaking the sire bond. You have your twelve hybrids. Now, where are my parents?

Prof. Shane: They're dead.




Hayley: You lied to me?

Prof. Shane: No, I didn't lie to you. I said I'd tell you where to find them.




Prof. Shane: This is everything you ever wanted to know, including where they're buried.




Hayley: You just picked a fight with a werewolf. You know that, right?




Prof. Shane: Easy, killer, all right? I'm not declaring war here. Now, just cause they're dead, doesn't mean you can't see them again.

Hayley: What?

Prof. Shane: This is far from over, Hayley. We are the beginning.

Forbes Residence




Caroline: You feel sorry for him?

Stefan: Look, there's no other way to break a vampire sire bond. As much as you and I both hate it, Damon does love Elena. Now he has to completely let her go. Ever imagine having to do that?

Caroline: I'm sorry I told her. Okay, I kind of didn't have a choice. All I know is he better do what he's supposed to do.




Stefan: He'll do it. He's not as bad as he wants you to think. He'll do what he needs to do, he told me he would.

Caroline: Is that all he told you?

Stefan: What do you mean?

Caroline: Nothing. It's just 
 It's just - how can you trust him?

Stefan: Because I think he loves her as much as I do. He can't be selfish with her. Not anymore.




Salvatore Boarding House




Elena: Hey.

Damon: Hey back.

Elena: How was your night?




Damon: Awful. Yours?

Elena: Same.

Damon: Elena, um...we need to talk.




Elena: I know that I'm sired to you, Damon.




Elena: Caroline told me. That's what you and Stefan were doing, isn't it? Is there a way to break it?

Damon: Not exactly. Which is why we need to talk.

Elena: Tyler told me the bond doesn't affect how I feel, just the way I act. My feelings for you haven't changed, Damon. Nothing has changed.

Damon: Everything has changed, Elena.

Elena: Okay, fine, yeah, I mean, I've changed. So have you, Damon. And I'm happy. Just like you were yesterday morning before we knew about any of this.

Damon: You know what would make me happy? To know that this entire time that I've been completely in love with you; that what you actually felt for me; was real.

Elena: It is real. I know that it is. Damon, I know what you're about to do. Please, don't do this to me.




Damon: I don't want to do this, Elena. I'm not the good guy, remember? I'm the selfish one. I take what I want. I do what I want. I lie to my brother, I fall in love with his girl, I don't do the right thing.




Damon: But I have to do the right thing by you.




Elena: Does this feel wrong?




Elena: Does this feel wrong?
