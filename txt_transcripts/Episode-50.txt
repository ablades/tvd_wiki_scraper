Elena: Good morning.
Alaric: So the pressure of your punch ejects the stakes.
Elena: Easy enough.
Elena: That's weird.
Elena: Must be jammed or something.
Alaric: You're not strong enough. Better start lifting some weights, put some meat on your bones.
Elena: Thanks for not sugar-coating it.
Alaric: You know what this is?
Elena: A vervain grenade. I've used one before.
Alaric: Then you know the element of surprise is your only advantage when it comes to a vampire.
Alaric: Surprise.
Elena: Oh my god.
Elena: This isn't a joke to me, Ric.
Alaric: You think I'm joking? Vampires will take whatever they want. They will hurt whoever they want. And they'll do it without remorse. It's their nature.
Elena: You don't have to use pronouns. You can say Stefan.
Alaric: Look, I get why you're here. Stefan hurt you. You don't want it to happen again.
Elena: But you think that I'm crazy. To believe that I can protect myself from a vampire who's flipped the switch on his humanity.
Alaric: I think you found a way to get out of bed this morning. And that makes you the strongest person I know. I think that you can do pretty much anything.
Caroline: Here we are. Senior year.
Bonnie: Anyone else think it should feel slightly more empowering?
Caroline: Okay. So prank night was a bust. But we are accepting it, and we are moving on.
Bonnie: You're right. I mean, why should I let the fact that my boyfriend is seeing the ghost of his dead girlfriends hinder this experience?
Caroline: Yes! And why should I let the fact that my boyfriend was turned into a hybrid put a damper on an otherwise fabulous day.
Elena: Today's our anniversary. Technically, Stefan and I met on the first day of school last year.
Caroline: Yeah. You win.
Bonnie: Are you sure you want to be here?
Elena: I have to be here. I have to put it behind me. New year. New life.
Stefan: Uh-oh. Alexandra, left hand, please.
Damon: Hey, the two brunettes on the staircase owe me a Persian rug.
Stefan: You mean, they owe us a Persian rug? It's my house, too, brother. Ooh! Would you like a spin?
Damon: So this is what Klaus had in mind when he compelled you to protect Elena?
Stefan: These ladies are helping me be all that I can be.
Rebekah: Where's Stefan?
Damon: Who the hell are you?
Rebekah: He left me here. My brother actually left me here.
Stefan: Oh, I'm sorry. Your tone implies that I'm actually supposed to care.
Damon: You're Klaus's sister?
Rebekah: Rebekah. Pleasure, I'm sure. Which one's my room?
Stefan: You're not staying here.
Rebekah: Rude. Both of you. I'll see to it myself.
Stefan: So I guess she's staying here.
Jeremy: So, what? It's not cool to talk to juniors anymore?
Bonnie: Hey. Happy first day.
Jeremy: You're mad?
Bonnie: I'm not mad. I'm resigned to the fact I'm sharing space in our relationship with Anna and Vicki.
Jeremy: I haven't talked to Vicki in a while.
Bonnie: That's not the point, Jeremy.
Jeremy: I know that. I know. Okay? But I had to see Anna again, Bonnie. She had information that Damon needed.
Bonnie: I get it, Jeremy. But put yourself in my shoes. You loved both of them. And you guys didn't break up. They died. And you keep letting them back in.
Jeremy: You think I want any of this?
Bonnie: I, um...I think you have the power to decide whether or not you see them. Remember that. Okay?
Vicki: You were always so much better at being a part of this than I was.
Vicki: Sorry.
Matt: You can't just keep appearing like this. Freaks me out.
Vicki: I'm a ghost. It's all I got. And I couldn't appear if you weren't thinking about me.
Matt: Well, I was just thinking about our first day last year. I was worried about running into Elena and you said...
Vicki: Suck it up, be a man, and show her what she's missing.
Matt: Yeah. Instead, she met a vampire.
Vicki: You okay, Matty? You seem unhappy.
Matt: Yeah, I just, life stuff. You know, with you gone and mom not around, it's...A lot to deal with alone. I'm glad I get to talk to you, though. I miss you.
Vicki: I miss you, too. What if I told you there was a way that you could help me come back?
Matt: What do you mean come back?
Tyler: Donovan! What are you doing? Come on, man. Let's go!
Tyler: You talking to yourself?
Matt: What's got you in such a good mood?
Tyler: We're seniors, man. Life is good.
Katherine: Come on, Mikael, breakfast.
Katherine: Mm, yummy. Mikael, wake up!
Katherine: What?
Damon: What? What do you mean, "what"? I've been calling you for two days.
Katherine: Odd, that's exactly how long I've been ignoring you.
Damon: Jeremy Gilbert told me that you found Mikael.
Katherine: Sort of. He's a little bit out of commission. He won't eat.
Katherine: And I've tried everything...Gravediggers, mourners, mice, rats, bats. He's just not interested.
Damon: Well, try harder. We need him to kill Klaus so I can de-rippefy Stefan before he destroys my house.
Katherine: Fine. I'll give it another shot.
Elena: Hey. Are you checking up on me? Because I'm fine.
Damon: Yeah. So...You might not want to come here for a while. We have a new housemate. Barbie Klaus.
Elena: Rebekah? She's living with you now? Why?
Damon: She's stranded. Apparently Klaus left her in the dust after I name-dropped Mikael.
Elena: What about Stefan? What is he up to?
Damon: Oh, you know Stefan. Journaling, reading, shaping his hair.
Elena: Come on, Damon. I can handle it. What?
Damon: Is that the bell? Oh...Ring! Ring! Don't want to be late!
Elena: I forgot about the bonfire.
Caroline: You have to go. It's our first spirit squad event. And it sets the bar for the whole year.
Elena: Relax, Caroline. I'll be there.
Caroline: Thank you. It's just that...
Tyler: Happy first day!
Elena: Is that blood?
Caroline: Oh my God!
Tyler: What's going on?!
Caroline: Vampire 101...don't wear your breakfast to school!
Tyler: Chill out. It was just a blood bag.
Caroline: From where?
Tyler: Rebekah hooked me up.
Caroline: Rebekah? And what are you even talking to her for?
Tyler: Klaus told her to keep a watch on me. Protect his new asset.
Caroline: His what? Why are you amused by this?
Tyler: I'm his first successful hybrid, Caroline. Don't you think that's the tiniest bit awesome?
Caroline: Oh, wow! I cannot believe you just said that.
Elena: So, I'm going to go. Good luck.
Stefan: Hello, Elena.
Elena: What are you doing here?
Stefan: What do you mean? I'm going back to school. Go Timberwolves!
Elena: What? Why?
Stefan: Klaus wants me to keep an eye on you. I'm just doing what I'm told.
Elena: I'm going to be late for class.
Stefan: Oh, class is this way.
Elena: Let go of me, Stefan.
Stefan: Elena, do you think I want to be a senior for the 100th time? No. But if I don't have a choice in the matter, then neither do you.
Elena: I said let go of me.
Alaric: Let her go.
Elena: Stefan, stop it!
Stefan: You're not gonna want to get in my way. Okay Ric? I will see you both in history.
Alaric: What the hell is he doing here?
Elena: Klaus compelled him to watch over me. Apparently I'm one of Klaus's assets now that my blood is the only way to create a hybrid.
Alaric: Now he's a bodyguard?
Elena: I don't know what he is. But he's definitely not Stefan.
Elena: Look, his being here is not good for any of us. We have to do something.
Stefan: You're in my seat.
: Hey you!
Alaric: Welcome back, seniors. Let's turn our brains back on, starting with this country's original founders...the Native Americans.
Rebekah: What about the Vikings?
Alaric: There's no evidence that Viking explorers actually settled in the United States. Who are you?
Rebekah: My name's Rebekah. I'm new. And history's my favorite subject.
Vicki: You have got no business in the stoner pit.
Matt: Figured you'd feel comfortable here.
Vicki: Touch√©.
Matt: So what do you mean that I can help you come back?
Vicki: Right now, I can only come back when you're thinking of me. But there is a way that I can be free of that.
Matt: How?
Vicki: I know this sounds crazy but I have help from the other side.
Matt: The other side?
Jeremy: Dude, what are you doing over here?
Matt: I could ask you the same question.
Jeremy: Just looking for my stoner lab partner. All right, see you around.
Matt: Can he not see you anymore?
Jeremy: He was talking to Vicki right out there in the open.
Anna: How?
Jeremy: When he died and came back, he must have started seeing her. She said that she could come back, that she had help on the other side.
Anna: Help? What kind of help?
Matt: Who's helping you?
Vicki: The witch I've been talking to says that there's a ritual. She can do magic from my side to push me over to yours.
Jeremy: Is it even possible? Could she come back?
Anna: I guess if she had a stronger foothold.
Jeremy: Like an anchor?
Anna: Exactly. Right now, I'm tethered to you. My only access point to your side is through you. But if she were to get a stronger foothold.
Vicki: I'll be able to come and go as I please...When I want, where I want. I won't have to rely on you.
Matt: But you'll still be a ghost, Vicki.
Vicki: In a town full of vampires, werewolves, and witches, I'll fit right in.
Matt: Seriously. You're going to make jokes about this?
Vicki: Matt! Relax. No one else will be able to see me.
Anna: She's bad news, Jeremy. There's nothing but darkness around her.
Jeremy: This is Vicki we're talking about. All right? She's not a bad person.
Anna: You can't upset the balance of nature without a price. If she's using a witch's energy from the other side, you don't know what price she's going to pay.
Vicki: I can be a part of this life again, Matt. Instead of being on the other side all alone. You won't have to be alone anymore either.
Matt: What do I have to do?
Cheerleader: Has anybody seen Dana?
Rebekah: Sounds like you have an opening on the squad.
Caroline: What are you doing?
Caroline: Hey. Hey. You can't just come here and infiltrate all of our lives.
Rebekah: I'm only interested in yours. Your spunk, your popularity.
Rebekah: Maybe even your boyfriend.
Coach: It's not the ballet, ladies. Let's move! Let's move!
Tyler: I think we're done here, coach.
Coach: Did you have a mental breakdown, Lockwood? Get back in line.
Tyler: I have a better idea.
Tyler: Shut the hell up so we can go get drunk at the bonfire.
Coach: Hit the showers, gentlemen.
Caroline: Try to be a little more subtle, Tyler.
Tyler: Coming from the queen of subtlety? Relax. I'm in total control.
Caroline: Then why are you acting like this?
Tyler: Drop it, Caroline. I'm fine. I've never been better. Klaus has given me this...gift.
Caroline: What?!
Caroline: My God!
Tyler: Damn, girl's got moves.
Stefan: Look at you being all fit. Hey, you going to the bonfire tonight? Sounds like fun, right?
Elena: Seriously, Stefan, leave me alone.
Stefan: You think I'm annoying now? Wait till homecoming. Hey, who you bringing, by the way? I don't want to be weird.
Guy: I'm sorry.
Stefan: Watch it, dick!
Elena: Who are you?!
Stefan: I'm the guy who's been assigned to protect a human blood bag. I mean, no offense or anything.
Stefan: What?!
Mikael: No! Get it away!
Katherine: You need blood.
Mikael: Get it away from me!
Katherine: Happy?
Mikael: Thank you.
Katherine: I remember you. Chicago, 1920s. You were looking for Klaus.
Katherine: You're not so scary for a...badass vampire vampire Hunter.
Damon: What? Are you going to bench press a vampire?
Elena: Do you actually know what's happening right now? Stefan called me a human blood bag. He's a completely different person.
Elena: Unh! What are you doing?
Damon: Helping you out.
Elena: Damon!
Damon: Come on, Buffy!
Elena: Stop it!
Elena: Like one obnoxious Salvatore isn't bad enough.
Damon: You called. I'm here. What's your plan, oh warrior princess?
Elena: I want to lock Stefan up, at least until this Mikael guy comes, kills Klaus, and the compulsion breaks.
Damon: Compulsion or not, Stefan's high on human blood, Okay? A lot of it.
Elena: You've gotten him off of it before.
Damon: This is different. It's not a stint in rehab, Elena. His humanity's gone. Light's out. No one's home.
Elena: Then do it for me, Damon. Every single time I look at him, I feel like I'm going to break. And I'm not going to give him that satisfaction.
Elena: What are you doing?
Damon: Feel that? It's a sternum. Solid plate of bone.
Damon: Right here, just below the ribcage, next to the spine, that's your way to a vampire's heart.
Damon: I'll do whatever it is you need me to do, Elena.
Damon: No one going to hurt you. Especially not my brother.
Elena: I'll lure Stefan away from the bonfire. Then when he's distracted...
Alaric: I'll shoot him.
Damon: Can't Bonnie just ju-ju him or something?
Elena: I'm trying to keep Bonnie out of this. I don't trust that Stefan won't hurt her. Caroline, are you covered?
Caroline: Yes! I will make sure that the old Forbes jail cell is prepped and ready.
Damon: We're forgetting a key player here. Rebekah? Wherever Stefan goes, the blonde ponytail tends to follow.
Elena: Which is why it's your job to keep her away.
Damon: How?! She's an Original. Last time I checked, we're out of daggers.
Elena: So then preoccupy her with your charm.
Alaric: Might have better luck finding the dagger.
Damon: Are you ever not going to be mad at me for a day?
Alaric: Doubtful.
Tyler: Sorry I'm late. What's going on?
Elena: We need you to raid your mom's vervain supply. Enough to keep Stefan down for a while.
Tyler: You can't do that to Stefan.
Caroline: Why not?
Elena: Trust me, Tyler, it's in his best interest.
Tyler: Yeah. It's not in Klaus's.
Caroline: But Klaus is the bad guy, Tyler. You know, why are you acting like some freaky, hybrid, slave minion.
Damon: Uh-oh.
Alaric: What?
Tyler: Klaus made me who I am, Caroline. I owe him everything.
Damon: Oh, boy.
Caroline: Okay, can we cool it on the commentary, please.
Elena: What is going on?
Tyler: I'm just going to go.
Caroline: What are you doing?!
Damon: He's been sired.
Alaric: What?
Damon: Sired. He feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus's blood created him.
Elena: Loyal how?
Damon: He'll seek acceptance from his master. It's really rare. But maybe not so much in hybrids.
Caroline: So how do I fix him?
Damon: Get a new boyfriend.
Stefan: You all right there?
Rebekah: I thought Tyler would be here.
Stefan: You're into Tyler now? That's kind of fickle.
Rebekah: When you're willing to give me the time of day again, then we'll talk. Until then, a girl has needs.
Elena: Excuse me.
Stefan: Elena, hi. What are you doing?
Elena: I'm having fun, Stefan. You have a problem with that?
Stefan: All right, take it easy. We both know you're kind of a lightweight.
Elena: Uh-huh. Really? You think I'm going to let a blood addict tell me how to drink?
Vicki: Concentrate on me, Matty.
Matt: This is too weird.
Vicki: Just focus. This is a good thing.
Vicki: Now say you accept me.
Matt: I accept you.
Vicki: Did you just...?
Matt: I felt that.
Matt: I feel that, too.
Vicki: It worked. Oh!
Vicki: I'm here, Matty!
Bonnie: Did you talk to Anna about this?
Jeremy: She's on the other side, Bonnie. Okay. I thought she might know something.
Bonnie: About what? I thought they were all alone over there.
Jeremy: Somehow Vicki's been communicating with some super strong witch.
Bonnie: If there's another witch involved, don't you think you should have come to me before you went to Anna?
Anna: Tell her not to be upset. I was just trying to help.
Jeremy: Not now, Anna.
Bonnie: She's here?
Jeremy: She's just trying to help.
Bonnie: I can't...I can't deal with this right now.
Jeremy: Bonnie!
Bonnie: Matt's trying to resurrect his dead sister. I think I'll go deal with that instead.
Vicki: Ah, I can feel this. I can feel everything.
Matt: The witch didn't mention this part?
Vicki: Makes sense. Our deal was that she'd help me do what I need to do.
Matt: What are you talking about? What deal, Vic?
Vicki: Well, if I want to stay here, I have to help her restore the balance.
Vicki: Klaus's hybrids can't be allowed to survive.
Matt: You can't kill Tyler, Vicki.
Vicki: Not Tyler, Matt. It's Elena who's the key to creating the hybrids.
Matt: What? Vicki, no!
Vicki: I'm sorry, Matty. But I want to stay.
Rebekah: What? No friends your own age?
Damon: Like you can talk.
Rebekah: Is this supposed to be fun? I've been through 10 of these.
Damon: No, you're just looking at it all wrong. This is a little rough on the outside.
Damon: But the inside...Yum.
Rebekah: Mmm. It's good.
Damon: Yep.
Stefan: What's that look?
Elena: What look?
Stefan: My brother's got his flirt on, and you're jealous.
Elena: I'm not jealous.
Stefan: It's all right. Be jealous by all means. I'm sure Damon will be thrilled.
Elena: I'm not jealous, Stefan.
Stefan: All right. That's my mistake.
Elena: Whatever. I'm out of here.
Bonnie: Matt! Matt, slow down. What happened?
Matt: I messed up, Bonnie.
Bonnie: What? How? Where is she?
Damon: Can't believe you've never had one of these before.
Rebekah: Well, I've been in a casket for ninety years.
Damon: That's no excuse.
Rebekah: Why are you being so nice to me? You hate me. You should be mean.
Damon: Well, I could be mean if that's what you're into.
Rebekah: You're distracting me. Why?
Damon: Just trying to be a good housemate.
Rebekah: There's never a fair fight between us, Damon. Remember that.
Tyler: What the hell? How did I get home?
Caroline: I brought you here. You were being a d-bag.
Tyler: What is your problem today?
Caroline: My problem is you've been sired. Do you even know what that means? It means that you put Klaus's needs first. He is your master now.
Tyler: I'm not anyone's pet, Caroline. He doesn't control me.
Caroline: Well, something's got to be controlling you. Because I don't know why else you'd be acting like the old you.
Tyler: The old me?
Caroline: Yeah. The old you. The pre-werewolf you. You know, the obnoxious you that I would never be friends with.
Tyler: Whoa! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. I don't want to be that guy. I hated that guy.
Caroline: You're a vampire now, Tyler. Everything about your personality is heightened. So you have to be careful.
Tyler: I will. I promise. Just...Don't hate me. Everything I like about me is you.
Elena: I used to know every constellation. How did I forget them all?
Stefan: You're drunk. You need to go home.
Elena: Fine. Unh. Let me find my car.
Stefan: You're joking, right?
Elena: Uh-oh. It's the fun police. I thought that ripper Stefan was supposed to be the life of the party.
Stefan: Well, all right, I'm driving you home. Come on.
Stefan: What are you, five? Get down.
Elena: Why? Are you afraid that I'm going to...
Elena: Oh. Ha. That was close. Klaus would not be happy with you.
Stefan: You're hilarious.
Elena: Look, Stefan, no hands.
Elena: I knew you'd catch me.
Alaric: You okay?
Elena: Yeah. I'm...Fine.
Alaric: You look, uh, not sober.
Elena: The plan worked. That's all that matters. Let's just get him out of here.
Matt: I'm so sorry. I didn't think she'd do something like this. I trusted her.
Bonnie: You need to tell me exactly what you did to let Vicki out. So I know exactly how to send her back.
Alaric: I see all the geniuses came out to the bonfire tonight.
Alaric: Elena! Elena! Open the door!
Elena: I can't! It won't open! What the hell?
Vicki: I'm sorry, Elena.
Bonnie: I found a spell that can block whatever magic is helping Vicki.
Matt: What do I do?
Bonnie: Give me your hand.
Elena: Stefan!
Vicki: What is she doing?
Matt: Fixing my mistake.
Vicki: Make her stop.
Matt: Bonnie...
Bonnie: The spell is working, Matt. She's still here because of you.
Vicki: Matt, please.
Matt: I can't let you hurt anyone, Vicki.
Vicki: I won't. I'll stop. Just, please, don't make me go.
Matt: I have to. This is wrong. You shouldn't be here.
Vicki: I'm sorry. I just didn't want to be alone anymore.
Matt: Neither did I. But I have to let you go.
Matt: Goodbye, Vick.
Matt: She's gone.
Alaric: Hurry up before it blows!
Elena: Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
Elena: Give it to me. I can do it.
Damon: No, let me.
Elena: Damon, come on.
Damon: Elena, you almost got barbecued. The least I can do is apply first aid.
Elena: You played your part of the plan really well tonight.
Damon: Oh, yeah?
Elena: You had Rebekah drooling all over you and your marshmallows.
Damon: Yeah, before she skewered me. I thought you were too drunk to notice.
Elena: I was faking most of it.
Damon: So was I.
Alaric: Ready to get going, Elena?
Damon: Great work tonight, Ric. Sorry about the car, man. Bummer.
Tyler: You're always running out on me.
Caroline: You have to earn the overnighter.
Tyler: I consider that a challenge.
Caroline: Bye.
Tyler: Bye.
Tyler: What are you doing here?
Rebekah: I have something for you.
Tyler: What?
Rebekah: A little present.
Tyler: You should go.
Rebekah: You sure? I think my brother would want his hybrid to indulge in everything life has to offer.
Mikael: I apologize for my outburst. It would have made more sense had you known that I've been denying myself human blood for as long as I can remember. Why is it that you awoke me?
Katherine: I thought you might know how to kill Klaus. But something tells me that I've been sorely misinformed.
Mikael: Would you mind helping me with these? I can assure you there's no way I can kill Klaus from beneath them.
Katherine: Does that you mean you do know how to kill him?
Mikael: I can kill Klaus. And I will.
Mikael: Thank you.
Katherine: A little blood will grease those muscles up real quick. Just saying...
Mikael: I don't feed on living things.
Katherine: Then what do you eat?
Elena: It's okay if you want to be friends with Damon again.
Alaric: I don't.
Elena: I think he kind of misses you.
Stefan: Well you got me tonight. Definitely wasn't expecting that.
Alaric: That was the point.
Stefan: Yeah. You know, you can hate it all you want, but Elena needs me. I'll always protect her. I think you're both better off having me around.
Stefan: Elena, wait. You could have let me die in that fire tonight. Why didn't you?
Elena: Because I still have hope.
Stefan: After everything I've done, you...You still think I'll be able to find my humanity again.
Elena: Yes, I do. I know who you really are better than anyone, Stefan. And I'm not giving up.
Stefan: Elena, do you have any idea how pathetic that makes you?
Elena: No, Stefan, it makes me strong.
Jeremy: Bonnie, come on. Stop dodging my calls. Don't you think we should at least talk about this?
Anna: I shouldn't be here.
Jeremy: No kidding.
Anna: No, I mean, I shouldn't be here, Jeremy. Why are you thinking about me when you're calling her?
Jeremy: I didn't think I was. Look, I don't know. Okay. I don't know what I'm doing, Anna. The problem is I don't think I can stop thinking about you.
Anna: I can't stop thinking about you, either.
Jeremy: What are we going to do?
Jeremy: Do you...feel this?
Anna: What's going on? I can feel you. How can I feel you?
Damon: Keep it up, Stefan.
Mason: This is going to be fun.
