The Hybrid

Tennessee House



Woman: Rudy! 
 Rudy. Come on! It's too hot to make me come looking for you.




Klaus: I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

Woman: Can I help you?

Klaus: Yeah, my car hmm, my car ran out of gas a couple of miles back. Eh I feel like I've been walking forever yours is the first house I come to so I was just hoping I could use your phone?

Woman: Don't you have a cell phone?

Klaus: Huh, yeah...
 Battery died. Look, I promise I'm not a serial killer I just wanna use your phone.

Woman: 
 Sure.

Klaus: Soo, I can come in?

Woman: No, I'll get the phone and I'll bring it out to you.

Klaus: 
 I thought you country folks were supposed to be more trusting.

Woman: I'm from Florida.

Klaus: Well, that explains it. 
 Now show me a little southern hospitality. Sweet pea.




Other woman: I bet you a hundred dollars that dog ran off to a house with air conditioning.




Other woman: What's going on?

Klaus: Please don't be alarmed. I was told Ray Sutton lives here.

Other woman: He's almost never here. He's on the road mostly.

Klaus: But I expect he makes it home, once a month. That's what I thought. Where is he now? 
 If I have to make you tell me it's going to be infinitely more painful for you. Hmm. 





Other woman: Aaaah!




Klaus: I love it when they run!

Other woman: 
 He's in Toll. It's near the border. A bar called Southern Comfort. It's on Highway 41.

Klaus: Thank you my love. 
 Now, may my friend come in?

Woman: 
 Yes.




Klaus: Kill this one quickly. 
 And make that one suffer. I'll be in the car.




Woman: Please don't!




Gilbert Residence





Jeremy: Aaahh! Early. Bad!

Elena: Ahh. It's not early. (Walks up to bed and pulls his cover off.) You're late, for work. Matt just called.




Jeremy: Well, maybe he'll fire me.

Elena: 
 Aim high.




Town Square



Elena: What are you doing?

Caroline: Just shopping for the party you're trying to bail out on.




Elena: I never said yes in the first place.

Caroline: You were never going to which is why I planned it anyway. And my mom wants you to call her.

Elena: Did she find something?

Caroline: An animal attack in Memphis. It's the third one this week in Tennessee.

Elena: And you're sure it's a vampire?




Caroline: Yes, but that doesn't mean that it's Klaus.

Elena: Doesn't mean it's not. (Going round the counter, pushing Alaric out of the way.) I'll call her.

Caroline: Well call her on her cell.

Elena: Tell her thank you for her help.

Caroline: All right. Well, I gotta go. I'll see you in a bit.




Elena: Oh, Caroline wait, just...keep tonight small. Please?

Caroline: Wear something pretty. (Hangs up. Tyler's there.) Hi!

Gilbert Residence
Elena: Ugh! (Sighs.)

Alaric: (Making the bed/couch.) Was that uh...Stefan news?

Elena: Could be more Klaus victims. (Puts down her cup.)

Alaric: You certain Stefan's still with him?

Elena: (Pouring a cup of coffee.) Easy to be certain when the alternative is that he's dead. (They're silent for a second, exchanging a look.) Are you sure you're still okay on the couch?

Alaric: Yeah, Yeah, I'm good.

Elena: (Pick up two cups of coffee.) Because you spent half the summer on it. (Walks over.) If you need your own bedroom?

Alaric: Eh, sleeping in your dead parent's room or my dead...girlfriend's room. Nah.

Elena: Alright (gives him a cup of coffee.) Got it. (Elena starts to walk away.)

Alaric: Hey Elena.




Alaric: Happy Birthday.

Elena: (Half smiles.) Thanks.

Salvatore Boarding House



Damon: We're out of champagne.

Andie: Huh. No you are out of champagne; I don't drink in the morning.

Damon: Well would you be a dear and walk...

Andie: (Interrupting him.) I think you can probably get it yourself. I'm not your slave.

Damon: Hmm.




Andie: I mean you're dripping a little.

Damon: Mm hm.




Damon: Good morning.

Elena: Hey, I was gonna...




Elena: Oh!




Elena: You heard me! You knew that I was here.

Damon: Yeah, you should learn to knock. What if I was...indecent?




Elena: Sheriff Forbes gave us another location to check. (Pulls out a note out of her pocket.) Memphis.

Damon: Another dead-end you mean.

Elena: You don't know that.

Damon: (Walking up to her.) You're right, Elena. This could be the one. After almost two months this could be the one clue that tells that Stefan is alive and well and living in Graceland.

Elena: (Takes the note.) Fine, I'll go by myself. (Starts to walk away.)

Damon: (Speeds up in front of her and takes the note.) Right, and let Klaus know you're tracking him. He thinks you're dead; let's keep it that way.

Elena: It's a new lead Damon; we haven't had one in a while.

Damon: Okay, I'll check it out. If I find anything I'll call you.

Elena: But...(Damon walks away.)




Damon: They moved on to Tennessee.

Andie: Huh, that fluttered victim you had me looking into had family in Tennessee.

Damon: Which one? Pensacola?

Andie: Aha.

Damon: Up for a road trip?

Andie: (Smiles.) Ha, no can do, I've got to work. But I can see if I can get you an address. (They kiss.) See you at the party.

Damon: Get me that address.

Mystic Grill



Jeremy: You need to come home. It's boring around here without you.

Bonnie: Huh, you think you're bored. My dad's side of the family is like wet paint that never dries.

Jeremy: (Smiling.)

Bonnie: How's the Grill treating you?

Jeremy: Well it's teaching me the value of a mundane human experience.

Bonnie: A summer job is good for you. You needed something normal in your life.




Bonnie: What was that?

Jeremy: Nothing. Look I uh...I got to go back to work. I'll talk to you soon okay?




Bonnie: Wait, wait Jeremy. Is everything okay with you?

Jeremy: Yeah, yeah. Normal and mundane. Come home soon okay.

Bonnie: Okay.




Jeremy: Vicki? (She disappears.)




Matt: I need you to switch sections with me.

Jeremy: Why?

Matt: Caroline and Tyler just sat in mine.

Jeremy: So?

Matt: So? I don't feel like waiting on my ex-girlfriend.






Caroline: Something's up with your mother.

Tyler: Like what?

Caroline: When I was over yesterday she just kept eyeing me.

Jeremy: Hey guys!

Caroline: Did Matt make you switch sections? (Jeremy just shrugs his shoulders.) He thinks we're dating.

Tyler: So does my mother.

Caroline: What?

Tyler: We're together all the time, it's not a leap.

Caroline: That's crazy.

Tyler: Right.

Southern Comfort Bar



Man: What's up Ray?

Ray: Hey Red, get me a beer.




Klaus: Ray? Ray Sutton?

Ray: Who wants to know?

Klaus: I've been looking everywhere for you. We started in Florida, Pensacola. I met a young chap there who you used to work with before you moved to Memphis, now he directed me to two lovely young women. And they led me here, to you.

Ray: I think I'll be going.




Klaus: Not so fast mate. You only just got here, now your type are very hard to come by.




Stefan: I wouldn't do that.




Ray: Vampires.

Klaus: You're swifty swift Ray! Yes! My friend here is a vampire. He compelled everybody in the bar so don't look to them for any help. I however, I'm something else, a different kind of monster. I've got some vampire, I've got some wolf.

Ray: You what?

Klaus: A hybrid Ray, I'm both. You see I want to create more of me. Now you being the first werewolf that I've come across in many a moon, pun intended Ray! I need you to direct me to your pack. So, where can I find them Ray?

Ray: You can't compel me, it won't work.




Stefan: (To the bar man.) Can you bring out the darts please? (To Ray.) Tell you what Ray, We're gonna play a little drinking game, something I like to call truth or wolfsbane.




Klaus: Oh, this is gonna be fun Ray.

Tennessee House



Alaric: Elena? (Damon makes a face.) I don't know why you just don't come clean and tell her where we are.

Damon: Because Andie said this was a half lead and I don't want to get her hopes up.

Alaric: Yeah, well they're all half leads, and I'm your accomplice. What do you want me to say to her, I'm practically living there.

Damon: Still sleeping on the couch? (They're looking around.)

Alaric: You know, I keep waiting for them to kick me out but they don't. I don't know why, it's not like I'm helping or anything.

Damon: (Agreeing.) Mm-mm.

Alaric: It's quiet.

Damon: Yeah. Too quiet.




Damon: Oh yeah.




Alaric: Ugh. Vampire for sure.

Damon: Stefan, for sure.

Alaric: How do you know?

Damon: It's his signature; there's a reason they call him the ripper. Feeds so hard he blacks out and rips them apart, but then when he's done, he feels remorse. It's the damndest thing. (He lifts his leg and wobbles the first woman's knee with his foot.) He put the bodies back together.




Alaric: Back together?

Damon: Definitely Stefan.

Salvatore Boarding House



Elena: (Taking some napkins from Caroline.) I feel like I have to fight Damon every single time we get a lead on Stefan.

Tyler: Maybe he doesn't want to find him.

Caroline: (Looking at him in shock.) Tyler!

Tyler: What? He's into you, isn't he?

Elena: The only reason Stefan left with Klaus was so that he could save Damon's life. I mean, trust me, Damon wants to find him.

Tyler: But you kissed him? (Caroline gives him "the look".) Probably screwed with his head.

Caroline: Tyler!




Caroline: I'm sorry!

Elena: Don't worry about it. Look, yes I kissed him, but it was a...it was a goodbye kiss. I thought he was gonna die. (Sighs.)




Elena: I missed a call from Bonnie. I'll be right back.

Caroline: (When Elena is out of sight.) Just because I tell you things doesn't mean you're allowed to know them!

Tyler: Sorry. I've gotta run if I'm gonna change and pick up Sophie in time.

Caroline: Wait. You're bringing a date? Slutty Sophie is your date?

Tyler: Hey! It's been kinda slow in that department. And....I am horny all the time now!

Caroline: Yeah, tell me about it, sometimes I feel like I'm gonna explode! It's a...vampire...thing. Yeah, our emotions are heightened and we're on overdrive.

Tyler: It's a werewolf thing too. Just like I can't turn it off.

Caroline: Yeah. (Awkward silence.) Well. Uh, I hope you'll get, uh, lucky tonight.

Tyler: (laughs.) I'll see you later.

Caroline: Yeah, see you later.

Tennessee House



Alaric: What are you doing?

Damon: Covering their tracks. Clearly they have no interest in staying in the dark, but I do.




Damon: Hang on.




Damon: Well, what do you know? Werewolves.




Southern Comfort Bar



Stefan: Ray, you can end this right now. Just tell me where your pack gathers for the full moon.

Ray: I can't.

Stefan: I know, I know. You live by code and all that, but see he's not gonna let me stop until you tell me. And I do whatever he says so, that's the way it goes around here.




Woman: Hello mister Klaus. I have some more information for you. (Stefan hears her and walks over.) You told me to tell you if I saw anything. (Stefan is eavesdropping.) I saw the guys spotted Damon at the farm house.

Klaus: Well, thank you Claudine. You'll just tell your friends to keep up the good work or they're gonna watch her.




Stefan: My brother still on our trail?

Klaus: He's getting closer, I'm gonna have to deal with that.

Stefan: (He grabs Klaus's arm.) No, no, no! Let me handle it.

Klaus: Why should I let you leave?

Stefan: Cause, you'll know I'll come back.

Klaus: Do I?

Stefan: You saved my brother's life; I'm at your service.

Klaus: Ah, you sound so tedious and indentured. Aren't you even having the least bit of fun? (He points to Ray with a big smile.)

Stefan: I'll make sure that my brother doesn't bother us any more. (Then Stefan walks away.)

Salvatore Boarding House



Elena: Don't worry I'm not gonna lose it. At least not before the cake.

Damon: It's your party, you can cry if you want to. (He walks up to her.) Ah, Stefan. Such a pack rat.




Damon: I got you something. I know I promised not to buy you anything so don't worry. I didn't pay for it.

Elena: You stole it?

Damon: No! (He holds up a little box. They stand just inches apart.) Found it.




Elena: My necklace. I thought I'd never see it again.

Damon: Alaric found it in his loft, thought you'd be happy to have it back.

Elena: I am happy, Thank you.

Damon: You're welcome.

Elena: Can you?

Damon: Absolutely.




Damon: Shall we?




Girls: Hey Elena! Happy Birthday!

Elena: Thanks.




Damon: Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. You don't want that. (He compels her.) You want the cheap young stuff over by the cheap young people.




Caroline: You like? Don't answer that.

Elena: This is keeping it small? (Caroline just keeps on smiling.) What are we drinking?






Matt: Where did you get that?

Jeremy: Henry from the kitchen sold me a dime.




Matt: So, what's got you on your spiral downward? Sure it's a lot more interesting than mine.

Jeremy: You do not wanna know.

Matt: (Takes a blow.) How bad can it be, I already know everything else. (Offering the pot to Jeremy.) Go for it.




Jeremy: You know I died right? And Bonnie used magic to bring me back to life?

Matt: Yeah, Elena told me.

Jeremy: The thing is, ever since I came back I've been seeing...things.

Matt: What kind of things?

Jeremy: Just, things I shouldn't be seeing.

Matt: What's Bonnie say about it?




Jeremy: Nah, I haven't told her. I haven't told anybody. Just messing with my head is all. I just need to chill out, so this.




Caroline: Oh...the Stoner den. Buzzkill.




Matt: Hey guys.

Elena: Matt, hey!




Elena: Oh.

Matt: Happy Birthday.

Elena: Thank you.




Caroline: He hates me. His hatred of me, has driven him to drugs!

Elena: He doesn't hate you, he hates that he's not with you. (Looks over to the couch.) Is that my brother?




Elena: Thank you.






Alaric: I am every parent's worst nightmare. I am the chaperone teacher from hell.

Damon: I love high school parties.

Alaric: Isn't Andie supposed to be coming?

Damon: Ten o'clock broadcast. Should be here in a little bit.




Damon: Hello Birthday Girl!

Elena: Drink!




Elena: Jeremy's smoking again.




Damon: Is his stash any good?

Elena: (Gives him the evil eye.) You're an ass. (Looks at Alaric.) Talk to him, please. He looks up to you.




Damon: You're screwed.

Alaric: Ahh.

WPKW9 Studio



Andie: Yeah, Uh huh. Uh huh. (Waves and whispers to man passing by.) Bye (To phone again.) Uh huh. Okay, I, I am the last person here again.




Andie: Days of work, please can we do this in the a.m.? I have a party I have to get to, and you gotta get a life! Okay, all right. Bye, bye.




Andie: Hello? Not cool. My retinas are burning.




Andie: Okay, Okay. Seriously who'd...? What the hell are you doing?




Andie: Hello? Hello?




Andie: Ohh! Stefan!? Oh my god! Oh my god, what are you doing here? We have been looking everywhere for you! (He doesn't answer.) Stefan?




Salvatore Boarding House



Matt: Since when are they a thing?

Caroline: I thought you were ignoring me?

Matt: I'm not ignoring you.

Caroline: You only said five words to me all summer, and those were four of them.

Matt: Maybe because every time I've seen you, you've been with him.

Caroline: Because he's my friend! Which is what I thought you were.

Matt: Aren't you guys supposed to be like mortal enemies? I mean isn't that how it works in vampire werewolf universe?

Caroline: Matt, shhhh! (Tyler looks at them.) What is wrong with you?

Matt: I don't know. I'm out of it...I guess. (Tyler looks at them again, and starts to walk up to them.) Sorry.




Tyler: What was that about?

Caroline: Nothing.

Sophie: Great party Caroline!

Caroline: (smiles.) Thanks! (Compels her.) Now leave it!




Tyler: What the hell?!






Damon: Andie wants me to pick her up.

Alaric: Your fake, compelled girlfriend wants you to be a chivalrous boyfriend?

Damon: Well, it's a complicated dynamic.

Alaric: Yeah.

Damon: Well, hold the fort down, will ya?

Alaric: You mean the fort full of my drunk history students?

Damon: Drink more, you will feel less weird.






Caroline: This room's off limits!




Elena: Caroline?

Caroline: Sorry. (She's holding a blood bag.) I just needed to take a beat. (She puts the bag down and walks up to Elena.) Are you hiding?

Elena: I was just looking for Damon.

Caroline: Well, he better be here somewhere because we haven't even done the cake yet.

Elena: I think I'm gonna pass on the whole cake thing.

Caroline: What? no, no way, no! It's your birthday! You know it's the dawn of a new day and, you can't get on with your life until you have made a wish and blown out the candles.

Elena: Is that what you all want me to do? Just get on with my life?

Caroline: No...Maybe...I just don't think anyone wants to see you like this.

Elena: I'm not gonna give up on finding Stefan, Caroline.

Caroline: Of course not. And you shouldn't, but you have to admit that you kinda just letting your life pass you by. And isn't Stefan the one who wanted to make sure that you lived it?

Elena: You want me to make a wish? I just wanna know that he's alive. That's it! That's my wish.




Caroline: I'm sorry, okay. I'm just drunk and dumb tonight. Wait, what are you doing..,?




Caroline: What's all that?




Elena: It's Klaus. Damon's been tracking him without me.

Caroline: Why wouldn't he just tell you?




Elena: I don't know.

WPKW9 Studio



Damon: (Playfully.) Andie?




Damon: Party Central.

Elena: Where are you?!

Damon: Umm, by the...punch bowl.

Elena: Don't do that Damon, don't lie to me! I saw your closet.

Damon: Oh...Oh, I gotta, gotta go break up beer pong.




Elena: Wait! Damon!




Damon: Stefan. (Stefan is standing in the middle of the studio.)

Stefan: Hello brother.

Damon: You don't write, you don't call.

Stefan: Need you to stop following me. Causing some problems.

Damon: With who? Klaus? Are we supposed to care with he thinks?

Stefan: What you're supposed to do is let me go.

Damon: Saw your latest artwork in Tennessee. Walking a fine line there my friend. Keep that up and there will be no saving you.




Stefan: See the thing is, uh, I don't need any saving. I just want you to let me go.

Damon: Nah, I got a birthday girl at home that's not gonna let me do that.




Stefan: You know, maybe I haven't made my point. Hey, Andie you still there?

Damon: Andie?




Andie: Damon? I can't move Damon. He told me that I can't move.

Damon: No, no, no, it's okay, Andie. Stay calm. Not cool brother!

Stefan: Aw, come on! A little bit cool. Huh? Hey, Andie. You can move now.

Damon: No! No, no, no, no, no NO!




Stefan: I said let me go!




Salvatore Boarding House



Jeremy: What are you doing?

Matt: I can't find my truck.

Jeremy: That's probably a sign you shouldn't be driving it. Need a ride?

Matt: You're more stoned than I am.




Jeremy: Ahh! What the...Vicki?!

Vicki: Help me.




Matt: Hey. What'd you just say?

Jeremy: Nothing.

Matt: Did you just say "Vicki", as in my sister Vicki?

Jeremy: What? No, no. I, uh, I didn't say anything.




Jeremy: No...




Matt: What's wrong?




Jeremy: You know what, maybe we should just walk.




Caroline: Excuse me. Excuse me.




Tyler: Hey! What is your problem?! You're pissed that I brought someone?

Caroline: Why would I be pissed? You brought a date. You're dating. That's...awesome.

Tyler: Okay, should I not be dating?

Caroline: Hey, you're horny all the time, right? I mean, a guy has needs.

Tyler: 'Cause if I shouldn't be dating, all you've got to do is say something. If you don't say something, then I'm going to keep dating.

Caroline: What would I say?

Tyler: Don't do that, Caroline! I've already been there once with you, okay, and you said no. You shut me down. I'm not going back there again unless you make it crystal clear that you...




Tyler: Let's get out of here.

Caroline: Uh huh.




Caroline: Hey! You missed the cake.






Damon: What? What are you doing here?

Elena: Why didn't you tell me? Why did you keep it a secret?

Damon: Can we not do this right now? I'm having a really bad night.

Elena: All summer, every single time I came to you with a lead, you made me feel like an idiot for having hope.

Damon: You were an idiot. We both were.

Elena: Tell me what you know, Damon.

Damon: I know you need to get back to your party, Elena.

Elena: We're supposed to be in this together. Why didn't you tell me that you've been tracking Klaus' victims?

Damon: Because they're not Klaus's victims, Elena, they're Stefan's!

Elena: What?

Damon: He's left a trail of body parts up and down the eastern seaboard.

Elena: No. You're wrong.

Damon: I've seen it happen before. He's flipped the switch. Full-blown ripper.

Elena: Stop it, Damon.

Damon: No, you stop, Elena! Stop looking for him. Stop waiting for him to come home. Just stop! Stefan is gone and he's not coming back. Not in your lifetime.




Gilbert Residence



Matt: All right, I should probably go before Elena and Mr. Saltzman come home and see what a bad example I am.

Jeremy: You sure you can walk?

Matt: We'll see. Can I take the ice cream with me?




Matt: What happened in the car, man?

Jeremy: Nothing.

Matt: Come on, man. You said, "Vicki". All right, you said my sister's name. Why? You said you were seeing things?

Jeremy: I've been seeing her.

Matt: I mean, I think I see her all the time, too. It's 'cause I miss her so much, though. You know, like, I want to see her so I do. Look, I know we've got our hands full with all the supernatural stuff in this town, but...ghosts?

Jeremy: Like I said, my head's all messed up.




Southern Comfort Bar



Klaus: Okay, it's a three step process, Ray. This is step one. I want you to drink from my wrist.

Ray: I already told you where to find the pack. What more do you want from me?

Klaus: Have you been listening to a word I've been saying, Ray? I have great plans for you.




Klaus: You'll thank me for it later, huh. There we go, attaboy!




Ray: What are you going to do now?

Klaus: It's time for step two, Ray.




Klaus: You're back.

Stefan: Did you doubt me?

Klaus: Not for a second. I knew you'd pass the test. You still care for your brother, for your old life.

Stefan: Nah, I don't care about anything anymore.

Klaus: You put on a good show Stefan. I almost believe you. Let's hope, for your brother's sake, he does. You never stop caring about family, do you? But, every time you feed, the blood makes it easier to let go.

Gilbert Residence



Elena: What are you doing?

Alaric: Ahh. I'm not going to stay here any more.

Elena: What? Why?

Alaric: I'm not a role model. You know, I drink too much, I say the wrong things. You know, I encourage bad behavior. At school I can pull it together, but in my own life...You know, the way I miss Jenna, it's just, I'm really not any good to anybody right now. I'm sorry, Elena. You're eighteen. You can do all this alone now. You can do it better without me.
