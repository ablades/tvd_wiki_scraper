WOMAN: Bonnie, is there something you wanted to talk about?
BONNIE: I guess, um... I've been thinking a lot about the past lately. How one stupid decision can...
BONNIE: ...Can turn your life into something that you don't recognize. Like it belongs to someone else. I made a mistake, and I lost someone I loved... And I'd do anything to take it back, but I can't. All I can do is...
BONNIE: ...Try and find a way to live with it.
WOMAN: Thank you, Bonnie.
WOMAN: Alex, is there something you'd like to share with the group?
BONNIE: What are you doing here?
ENZO: Things are bad out there, love. You can't hide in here forever.
BONNIE: Hey, how's she doing?
ALARIC: 
BONNIE: Yesterday she was dead. Today she's alive. I'm not sure normal applies.
ALARIC: Please tell me that's food.
BONNIE: Term papers. They were jamming up your inbox. You are still employed as a professor here.
ALARIC: Hey, do you want a job as my new TA? All you have to do is write, "Interesting point," in a few margins and then give everyone a B+.
BONNIE: Tempting, but I need to figure out exactly how I brought your wife back to the land of the living.
ALARIC: Look. She's here. She's okay. What does it matter now?
BONNIE: 
ALARIC: Oh, hey. Hey, sweetheart, how you feeling?
JO: I'm starving.
STEFAN: This is torture for you, isn't it?
CAROLINE: No...
STEFAN: Hmm.
CAROLINE: No! I'm so happy just lying here and doing nothing. Just... listening to you... breathe.
STEFAN: Mmhmm. Just making a mental checklist of all the things you need to do today? Debating whether you should accidentally kick me awake?
CAROLINE: Uh, did you say kick, or did you say kiss?
STEFAN: Hmm?
CAROLINE: Mmm...
DAMON: Good morning, lovebirds!
STEFAN: Oh...
CAROLINE: Are you kidding me?
DAMON: 
CAROLINE: Actually, I hate sugar in my coffee.
DAMON: Mmm.
STEFAN: Is there any particular reason as to why you are barging into my girlfriend's dorm room at the crack of mid-morning?
DAMON: Why such a Grumpy Gus? I thought you'd want to celebrate today. I finally got Elena tucked away safely. You're snuggled with Caroline in this tragically tiny bed, and Ric? Ric saved his lady from the great beyond! Everything is coming up Salvatore, so much so that I have decided to turn over a new leaf.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Yeah. I am gonna be the man that does right by Elena, all on my own, by keeping her in my heart instead of keeping her underfoot.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: I'm gonna need a little help with the dirty work, so rise and shine, brother. We are going to interrogate a tall, beautiful Heretic with a terrible attitude.
CAROLINE: Valerie?
DAMON: Rings a bell.
DAMON: Hmm. I'm missing something here.
CAROLINE: Oh, Stefan and Valerie are old flames from way back, and they haven't had a face-to-face since she came tumbling out of that prison world.
DAMON: Hang on. Valerie as in v-card Valerie? "Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am," broke your heart and, uh...?
CAROLINE: You know what? I think this would be the perfect opportunity for you two to catch up! Unless there's a reason it would be uncomfortable for you...
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Great! Have fun.
ENZO: Enjoy it, mate. It's the last of it.
LILY: Good morning, Oscar.
LILY: It was kind of you to sit with him all night.
ENZO: Oh, I've had a few bad nights myself over the years.
LILY: Right here, please, Lucy. Thank you.
ENZO: Oh, what's the occasion?
LILY: My mother always used to keep fresh flowers when expecting guests. I suppose I picked it up from her.
ENZO: Ah, Julian, I presume.
LILY: 
ENZO: 
LOUISE: 
NORA: He's still sitting there?
NORA: Oscar? Darling, it's Nora. Do you... Do you remember me?
LOUISE: 
LOUISE: Guess what, Oscar? Julian's coming back. Life's about to get fun again.
NORA: So fun!
NORA: Right. Well, he's clearly unwell. We can't just leave him here.
LILY: Lorenzo, you wouldn't mind keeping an eye on him, would you? We won't be long.
ENZO: 
LILY: Thank you. And, if you hear from Valerie, please tell her to come home immediately. I know I was stern yesterday, but that's no reason to sulk.
LILY: Come on, girls.
ENZO: 
VALERIE: Headed out to find Julian, and trying to find the directions on Oscar's stupid phone. Why doesn't anyone use real maps anymore? What's wrong with paper?
ENZO: Well, I suggest you get a move on, because Lily and company are right behind you.
VALERIE: What? That's impossible. You promised to keep Oscar quiet.
ENZO: 
VALERIE: Wait. What does it mean when the little bar thing goes all red? I...
VALERIE: Hello?
DAMON: 
DAMON: That's a hefty fine, young lady!
VALERIE: How did you...?
DAMON: 
DAMON: You did realize that by taking a deputy's SUV that every move you made would be tracked, right?
VALERIE: 
DAMON: That car? You bet I'll move that car. But first, I need to ask you why you killed your faux-brother Oscar and framed me for the murder.
VALERIE: I have no idea what you're talking about.
DAMON: 
DAMON: I'm gonna go to my car, get my phone. I'm gonna call Lily. See if she knows.
VALERIE: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Valerie.
DAMON: AGH!
VALERIE: Stefan...
STEFAN: Quit torturing my brother and tell me exactly what's going on here.
BONNIE: Is it safe to enter? Or is your boyfriend still half-naked under the sheets?
CAROLINE: 
BONNIE: Please! At least your bed has seen a half-naked male all semester. I think Ms. Cuddles is starting to feel sorry for me.
BONNIE: I mean, look at her! Do you see how she's judging me?
BONNIE: 
CAROLINE: Well, don't look at me for advice. I just sent my boyfriend to spend the day with his first love.
BONNIE: Valerie? The Heretic who turned your skin to vervain so you and Stefan couldn't touch?
CAROLINE: 
BONNIE: Wow. You're either completely insane, or the most secure woman in the world.
CAROLINE: 
BONNIE: 
CAROLINE: So, are you going out to meet a guy?
BONNIE: 
DAMON: Okay. I think I got it.
DAMON: You killed Oscar because he knew how to get to Julian, but you hate Julian because he's a sadistic, depraved, no-good monster that Lily desperately wants to bring home.
VALERIE: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: Speaking of which, how did you two, um... meet?
STEFAN: At the town fair.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: And then, you were supposed to meet after that, right? Like, under a bridge, or a tree, or a romantic park bench...
STEFAN: 
DAMON: You know, when you didn't show, this guy wrote ten pages in his journal about how the sun would never shine as bright, and the food would never taste as sweet...
DAMON: Yes. I read them. Your hiding places were always crap.
DAMON: You really crushed the guy.
STEFAN: Well, she was just spying for Lily. I mean, it was all a game, wasn't it?
DAMON: Ouch!
STEFAN: But, yeah. No! Hey, hey, keep going man. This bit is, uh, absolutely hilarious.
VALERIE: No. Please stop. The only thing that matters now is that we find Julian and make sure he can't come home. So, if you're not in, spare me the car ride and let me out.
DAMON: No. Stefan's in. He's in! I'll watch.
STEFAN: 
JO: Is that art or something?
ALARIC: Heh. No. Actually, that's a TV.
JO: That's a TV. I'm Jo. You're Alaric, but you go by Ric because it's an odd name, and we're married.
ALARIC: Let's not worry about the details right now. It's gonna take a little time for your memories to come back.
JO: This is amazing. Did you make it?
ALARIC: No. It's, uh... It's delivery.
ALARIC: Made somewhere else and then someone drives it over. It's Thai food, your favorite.
ALARIC: Well, except for that. That's meat. You don't eat meat.
JO: 
ALARIC: 
ALARIC: Hey, look. Let's open this bottle of wine, huh? It's got to be 5:00 in the afternoon somewhere, right?
ALARIC: Ooh! Ah! Ah!
JO: It's not serious. Do you have bandages? I'll wrap it for you.
ALARIC: Medicine cabinet above the sink.
JO: Be right back.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Some gas station in the middle of nowhere.
DAMON: Don't worry, Care-Bear! I have issues a "No Hanky-Panky" zone. No former flames will reignite on my way! Uh-uh. No how.
STEFAN: Sorry about that. The fumes are, uh, getting to his brain. Hey, listen-- uh, I want to take you to dinner tonight.
CAROLINE: Like a date?
CAROLINE: Wait, is this because you're feeling guilty for spending the day with your ex?
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Well, I'd love that. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit guilty for pushing you into a car with your brother and your ex, whom you clearly want nothing to do with.
STEFAN: Ah. No, don't feel guilty. I... I needed a push.
CAROLINE: Why? What, did she make a move on you?
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: She didn't deny it.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: I will be, once you tell me what time I'm picking you up tonight.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: Fill this up.
DAMON: There's more gas in the tank, sassy-pants.
VALERIE: I need an accelerant to burn Julian's body. Don't want to take any chances.
DAMON: 
VALERIE: 
DAMON: What are you gonna do, charm him to death?
VALERIE: Julian's dead. He's been dead since 1903.
ENZO: 
BONNIE: 
ENZO: 
BONNIE: 
ENZO: Well, I do admire your nerve, sticking around. Now, myself? I'd be flat-hunting on the other side of the planet if I were the only thing standing between Damon Salvatore and his everlasting happiness with Elena. Maybe the danger gives you a thrill? It could be a case of puppy love...
BONNIE: See, now I think you're projecting. You're the one sleeping at Lily Salvatore's feet, hoping for some of her good table scraps.
ENZO: Good talk. Nice of you to stop by.
BONNIE: Um, I need to talk to Oscar.
ENZO: 
BONNIE: 
ENZO: Well, I'm afraid Oscar is not feeling quite like himself today, so maybe another time.
LUCY: AHHHH!
ENZO: Bollocks.
LUCY: UHH! UGH!
ENZO: 
BONNIE: 
ENZO: 
BONNIE: Hello, Oscar. Hey, do you remember me? We met in Myrtle Beach.
OSCAR: 
BONNIE: Out of where?
OSCAR: I think I'm still hungry.
BONNIE: 
OSCAR: What stone? Why do people keep asking me questions I don't know the answer to?
BONNIE: This stone. Know it?
OSCAR: 
STEFAN: Why would Oscar stash Julian's body out here in the middle of nowhere when he could just hand him over to Lily?
DAMON: Mmm!
VALERIE: Because he knew the moment Lily gets Julian back, the fun's over. Everything changes.
STEFAN: So, you killed him. That makes a lot of sense.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: You know, I was thinking... It's probably a good thing that you and I cut things short. I mean, what if I'd accidentally insulted your driving, and you had no choice but to run a butcher knife through me?
VALERIE: 
DAMON: Hey, lovebirds! Quit your bickering. Let's get this campfire started.
DAMON: Huh. Casket Emporium. Clever.
VALERIE: 
DAMON: So, Lily's still carrying a torch for some moldy, old corpse, hmm?
VALERIE: Lily is determined to reunite Julian's body with his lost soul. But, in order to do that, she needs the Phoenix Stone.
DAMON: Phoenix Stone, huh? Never heard of it.
VALERIE: Really? That's funny, since you clearly used it on Oscar.
DAMON: 
VALERIE: 
DAMON: Wait-- what do you mean, whoever we brought back?
VALERIE: The Phoenix Stone is stuffed full of very old vampire souls. You didn't raise Oscar from the dead, you clods! You jammed one of those souls into his body.
DAMON: How's everything with Professor Frankenstein and his rebooted bride?
BONNIE: Good, I think. She was asleep when I left.
DAMON: Oh, good. Glad to hear it. So, quick favor-- I'm gonna need you to tell Ric that we made a tiny mistake, and that that's not his wife.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: Yeah... It turns out that the stone doesn't actually have any magic juice to bring back any old corpse. It's more like a supernatural holding cell for a bunch of lost vampire souls, one of which you accidentally shoved into Jo's body.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: 
BONNIE: 
DAMON: Bad idea! Cut the conversation short. Call Ric from the car on the way home.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: ...I just don't think that she'd want me to crush his spirit like that. Let him down gently?
BONNIE: 
BONNIE: Fine, but you owe me.
DAMON: 
ENZO: Found Oscar a few blood bags stashed in the study. Probably expired, but he does not seem picky.
BONNIE: I have to head back to Whitmore.
ENZO: I meant to ask you about this pretty stone. Where'd you find it?
BONNIE: 
ENZO: That's funny. Lily's been looking for one just like it.
BONNIE: 
ENZO: 
BONNIE: I don't think so.
OSCAR: I'm not going back in there!
OSCAR: No! I'm not going back!
ENZO: What the hell is he talking about?
BONNIE: Let's just say you were right-- Oscar's not himself today.
OSCAR: Why does everyone keep calling me Oscar? My name's not Oscar!
OSCAR: Did I do that?
BONNIE: 
ALARIC: You want to get some fresh air? I thought maybe a walk through campus will stir something...
ALARIC: ...What are you doing?
JO: What happened to me?
JO: This was mine, wasn't it?
ALARIC: 
JO: What happened to me?
ALARIC: 
JO: 
ALARIC: 
JO: 
ALARIC: Because it is crazy, Jo! It is the craziest thing either of us have ever been through, and that is saying something.
JO: I remember. I was stabbed! I was stabbed in the heart!
ALARIC: No. No, not in the heart. He came at you from behind, and I... I didn't see him until it was too late.
JO: No, I was stabbed in the heart!
ALARIC: Jo, calm down.
JO: I...
ALARIC: Everything's gonna be...
JO: No! Don't touch me! Stay away from me!
STEFAN: You know, we got Nora to siphon that repulsion spell you put on Caroline... Just in case you were wondering.
VALERIE: Oh. I'd forgotten all about that.
STEFAN: Why'd you do it? I mean, you couldn't have been worried about Caroline's safety.
VALERIE: What do you want me to say? Because I'm pure evil? Because I like seeing people suffer?
STEFAN: Well, if that's the truth, then yeah.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: This one won't open.
VALERIE: Must be sealed shut.
DAMON: 
VALERIE: His body's been preserved with magic.
DAMON: Lot better-looking than our old man, I'll give Mom that.
VALERIE: Move. Unless you want to burn to a crisp alongside of him.
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: 
DAMON: Should we, uh... get a match?
VALERIE: 
DAMON: 
LOUISE: Look who's in a heap of trouble!
NORA: What's Lily going to say?
LOUISE: 
LOUISE: Lily, we found Valerie! She's over here trying to kill the love of your life.
LILY: Girls, I'll meet you in the car. I need a moment with Valerie.
LILY: You may have stolen Oscar's phone, but you left something behind in his pocket.
LILY: Oscar always did covet Julian's ring. Beau found him easily with a locator spell.
LILY: Why would you do this?
VALERIE: Lily, he's a monster! Bringing him back will only make things worse.
LILY: So you go behind my back with my own sons to destroy him?
VALERIE: It's not like you listen to me! You were so blinded by your love for him, it's like no one else exists.
STEFAN: Hey, we get it. You're angry.
LILY: Whatever lies Valerie told you, that's all they are.
DAMON: Technically, she's been a bit vague on the details... I mean, mass-murderer, homicidal maniac, and typical, run-of-the-mill bad-guy stuff... But, before we just hand him over, you mind telling us what we're missing here? Who is this, really?
LILY: 
LILY: You know anything about that?
DAMON: A thing or two.
LILY: 
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: She's playing you! He didn't make her better-- if anything, he made her vindictive and cruel!
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: Who do you think gave Kai the idea to put Elena in that Sleeping Beauty-coma?
DAMON: Who?
VALERIE: Lily.
DAMON: Is that true?
VALERIE: She wanted to make you pay for refusing to help rescue us from the prison world.
DAMON: Screw Julian! I'll kill you.
BONNIE: 
ENZO: 
BONNIE: 
BONNIE: Maybe he'll tire himself out, and we just go out the front door?
ENZO: Or, I could just jump out that window while you fend for yourself.
BONNIE: First, give me that stone back.
ENZO: First, tell me why it's so special!
BONNIE: 
ENZO: Julian.
BONNIE: 
ENZO: He's not a Heretic. He's a long-lost vampire boyfriend.
BONNIE: Then you definitely don't need it. Do you really want to hand her the means to bring the dead boyfriend back into the picture? Have some dignity!
ENZO: What makes you think I want romantic advice from a love-lorn witch?
BONNIE: I'm just saying-- maybe you deserve better.
ENZO: Bad news-- I think Oscar just learned how to siphon.
OSCAR: 
BONNIE: 
DAMON: GAH!
STEFAN: UGH!
DAMON: Ohhh...
STEFAN: Valerie.
STEFAN: Valerie!
STEFAN: Hey! You okay?
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Whatever you're thinking, we're not gonna do that.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: She's still our mother.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Screw the new leaf! She stole Elena from me, and every ounce of happiness I've ever known! I'm not gonna let her just walk away from that!
STEFAN: We're not gonna let her walk away from that. I promise. But, right now, I need to find Valerie, so just tell me that you're fine and you're not gonna do anything stupid.
DAMON: I'm fine. I'm okay.
STEFAN: 
OSCAR: Give me the stone!
ENZO: Here, boy. Fetch.
OSCAR: 
ENZO: Finders keepers.
STEFAN: Valerie! Don't move. I'm gonna get these out.
VALERIE: AH! It's pointless. If Lily doesn't kill me, Julian will.
STEFAN: Well, maybe it's pointless, but I'm not the type to leave someone hanging.
VALERIE: Couldn't help yourself, could you? If I'd known how deeply you'd hate me, I would have acted differently.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: It's not the truth, Stefan.
VALERIE: NGH!
VALERIE: The truth is... I was coming back for you.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: I was pregnant.
STEFAN: What?
VALERIE: I wanted to tell you in person, though, and I felt ridiculous. We... we spent so little time together. For me to end up pregnant? I just... I wasn't sure if...
VALERIE: But Julian had already found out. He made sure there was nothing to tell.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: He, um... made sure it wasn't a problem anymore. He knew I wouldn't be able to look you in the eye and tell you, so I left with them. I kept our secret all these years... and I'm so sorry.
ENZO: Oscar died two nights ago when Valerie killed him. I'm pretty sure that Damon and Bonnie brought him back with this.
ENZO: I suspect they didn't get it quite right, though-- he went mad and tried to kill me.
LILY: 
ENZO: Why would Valerie throw away everything-- her family, your respect, her livelihood-- just to keep Julian away from you?
LILY: 
LILY: Give me the stone, please.
ENZO: And what? Stand idly by while you reawaken some bloke who may or may not have complete control over you.
LILY: Call it what you will... devotion, control? I call it love. So, if you're asking me to choose between you and Julian...
ENZO: That's exactly what I'm asking.
LILY: 
ALARIC: Hey.
BONNIE: You with Jo?
ALARIC: No. She freaked out a little. I... you know, I could really use your help looking for her, actually.
BONNIE: It's not her, Ric. It's not Jo.
ALARIC: 
BONNIE: We made a mistake. The stone doesn't bring people back from the dead. It is just an old relic full of souls.
ALARIC: : Bonnie, that is my wife. I know who I'm looking at, okay? She just... she needs a little time to adjust.
BONNIE: 
ALARIC: I got to go.
ALARIC: Hey, I... I just want to talk.
JO: Here. I realized I have no idea how to use that thing.
JO: Nothing about this world is familiar to me. Not you, not any of this. Not even my own reflection.
ALARIC: You're not my wife.
JO: No. I don't think I am. If I'm not Jo, who am I?
ALARIC: I don't know, but you're not alone. I'll help you, and we'll figure this out together, okay?
CAROLINE: Hey, not to be a pessimist, but how late do you think you're actually gonna be? Should I move the reservation to nine o'clock, or...?
STEFAN: ...I'm actually still in Mystic Falls.
CAROLINE: ...Or tommorrow, or next week?
STEFAN: I'm sorry.
CAROLINE: It's okay!
STEFAN: Things got... complicated.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Is... Is there anything else monumental I should know about?
STEFAN: No. No, nothing. I'll see you tomorrow?
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Bye.
VALERIE: You didn't say a word the whole way back.
STEFAN: I didn't really know what to say.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: After it happened, I wanted to die. I did die. I took my own life. I obviously didn't realize I had vampire blood in my system...
STEFAN: That's how you became a vampire? You killed yourself?
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: Please don't tell anyone. I couldn't bear for Lily to know.
STEFAN: I won't. I promise.
VALERIE: Okay.
VALERIE: I don't presume to know you now, or even what you wanted back then, but...
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: Look, we have, um, five guest rooms. You should probably stay the night.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: 
LOUISE: 
BONNIE: 
DAMON: 
BONNIE: Guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree?
DAMON: 
BONNIE: You sure you wanna do this?
DAMON: Burning that bastard's body would've been too good for Lily.
LOUISE: 
DAMON: I want to give her that man she's cherished and loved and missed for a hundred years.
LOUISE: 
DAMON: I want her to run into Julian's arms, and I want her to remember what it feels like to have him returned. I want her to taste true happiness...
LOUISE: 
LILY: Julian, is it you?
JULIAN: Lily? Darling!
DAMON: And then, I want to rip his head off right in front of her. I want to break her heart. I want to break her spirit. I want to destroy her.
BONNIE: So much for that new leaf, huh?
DAMON: 
BONNIE: You're doing right by Elena.
DAMON: Well, glad to see you boarding this train to Crazytown, Bonnie Bennett! I was getting lonely all by myself.
