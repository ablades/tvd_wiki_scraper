Bonnie: What is she doing?
Caroline: Having fun, obviously!
Matt: About time, too.
Matt: Take it off!
Elena: Jeremy, come on!
Elena: To friends!
: To friends!
Elena: Am I seriously that easy to impersonate, or do you guys not know me at all?
Jeremy: Elena; what's going on?
Elena: When have I ever danced on a bar half-naked? You think I would come to a college bar, with my under-aged brother and do tequila shots?
Matt: Elena.. what are you talking about?
Elena: I'm not Elena, Matt. I'm Katherine. It's not me.. you guys know me. I-I-I would never do that, guys! Katherine has taken over my body! This isn't me.
: Hello?
Elena: Hello?
Elena: Hello?
: Hey. You're awake.
Elena: Stefan.. What are you doing here? Where is everyone?
Stefan: Everyone's gone. The whole school cleared out for spring break. You've been in and out since you first woke up.
Elena: Oh. O-O-K. That makes sense. I thought I was going crazy.
Elena: What's going on? Wh-y-y...
: We had to seal you into the building.. We've got a lot of catching up to do.
CREDITS:
Elena: The last thing I remember, I was running through the woods.. m-my head felt like it was being attacked by Katherine's whole life. I saw Damon and I threw my arms around him.. and.. nothing.
Stefan: Yeah... that was about three weeks ago.
Elena: Three weeks ago? Wow. Three weeks... yet it took just one second for Katherine to infect me with some virus that makes me want to kill all my friends.
Stefan: Oh yeah. You know Katherine - She's not about to go out without a grand finale.
Elena: Do you really think this whole lock-down is necessary? I mean, I feel fine.
Stefan: Look.. we shouldn't take any chances. If Damon taught us anything is that the virus makes you want to attack at the mere scent of vampire blood.
Elena: Well, how did you...
Stefan: Liv...
Elena: Liv?
Stefan: She's a new witch. Bonnie's been teaching her some spells. Look, I know this is a lot to process, but just know that Caroline's out, looking for the antidote and in the mean time, we've figured out how to ration blood to keep you satiated. We're going to figure this out, okay?
Elena: I need to talk to Damon.
HOUSE:
Damon: Hilarious.
Damon: Give me the damn cup.
Damon: Wipe that smile off your face.
Jeremy: Hey! You're lucky I'm even helping you! Considering the last thing you did for me was to tell Enzo to strangle me to death.
Damon: Quit crying! You're still around.
Matt: Yeah, which is more than we can say for Aaron Whitmore. Weren't he and Elena tight?
Jeremy: Yep.
Matt: Does she know that Damon killed him?
Jeremy: I don't know.. Does she?
Damon: No, she doesn't because I'm going to be the one to tell her. If either of one of you clowns beat me to it, I'll rip your tongue out.
Damon: Don't you even think about it!
: Damon's phone!
: Jer?
Jeremy: Yeah. How are you feeling?
Elena: A little confused, but good. I miss you.
Jeremy: Same here.
Damon: I killed you once before, Gilbert. I'll kill you again.
Jeremy: Someone wants to speak to you.
Damon: Hey you.
Elena: Hey you.
Damon: So... eaten anyone yet?
Elena: Nope! So far, I am symptom free, although Stefan still has me on the, uhh, Damon diet (just in case)
Damon: Ahhh. Yeah. It sucks. You're going to be craving carbs constantly, but hey, you know what? There's a plus side. You get to keep your girl's figure.
: Hey, uh. I'm calling you on a payphone.
Damon: Well, how retro of you! Does that mean you memorized my phone number?
Elena: Maybe.. Katherine put a password on my cell, so I can't use it.
Damon: Ahhhhh! That would explain all those crazy instagram pics you've been uploading lately.
Elena: What?
Damon: Kidding! Kidding!
Elena: Damon! That's not funny! I have no idea what I've been doing for the last three weeks.
Damon: I know.. I'm sorry. Well, what'd you want to know? I'll tell you..
Elena: How did she do it?
Damon: How did she do what?
Elena: Break your heart..
Damon: Oh... that.. I don't know. It's not like it has been playing on a loop in my head over-and-over again.. So, I don't really remember.
Elena: Ahh.. I'm so sorry. I really am. The last thing I remember, I was running into your arms.. and-and I felt so safe.
Damon: Well, it was all downhill from there.
Elena: I wanted to fight for you. I still do.
Damon: Elena.. The second we are cured of this and don't want to rip each other's heads off, I am going to hunt you down and give you the most mind-blowing night of your life.
Elena: I think I could schedule you in.
Elena: One question: How exactly do we cure this?
LAB:
: Oh my god.
Enzo: So werewolves are real? I always thought that, was, you know, a joke.
Enzo: I'm Enzo.
Caroline: The Enzo...
Enzo: No.. The other one.
Caroline: Ha. Alright, other Enzo. I don't know what it is you're doing here, but I don't want any part of it.
Enzo: I'm here for the same reason you are.. I want this vampire-feeding virus out of our lives.
Caroline: Why? You want your killing buddy back? Is killing innocent people not as much fun when you're alone?
Enzo: Right. Damon mentioned you get a little judgy. Then again.. He also said you had a thing for accents.
Caroline: Ugh. Just stay out of it. We don't need any more problems.
Enzo: Then you're not the least bit impressed that I have the antidote?
CONVERSATION:
Damon: Can we talk about the irony of Katherine Pierce sitting through a college lecture.
Elena: Oh no.. I'm flunking, aren't I?
Damon: No way! If anything, there's some sucker probably compelled to spend his entire spring break doing your homework.
Elena: Hahaha. Yeah. You're probably right. Let's add that to the list of the things I need to fix, starting with Aaron.
Damon: Aaron? What the hell does he have to do with anything?
Elena: I haven't seen or talked to him since he found out that I was a vampire and thought I wanted to kill him.
Damon: Well.. uh, you probably won't find him.
Elena: Why?
Damon: No reason...
: Elena!
Elena: Uh.. Stefan just got here. He brought me a new cell phone. I'm going to call you right back, okay?
Stefan: You okay?
Elena: Uh.. not feeling so good, all of a sudden.
Stefan: That's because you're starving..
Elena: Yeah..
Stefan: Here, uh. I got you four ounces of my blood.
Stefan: You won't be scaling any buildings, but it'll curb the cravings.
Elena: Thank you.
Elena: I need more
Stefan: Sorry.
Elena: I feel fine, Stefan. I just need a little more.
Stefan: You're not fine, Elena.
Elena: Come on.. Trust me. I can handle this.
Stefan: You think so?
Elena: Yeah.
Stefan: You're not fine, Elena.
:
Elena: She's turned me into a monster! I'm a ripper, aren't I?
Stefan: You'll feed until you kill. Yeah.
Elena: I hate her. No.. you know what? I hate myself. Because I was dumb enough to sit next to her while she was dying and-and actually forgive her!
Elena: Please tell me that's some good news.
: Bad news... It's not the same virus.
Stefan: What is it?
Caroline: Dr. Creepenstein was working on the next phase of the virus. When Nadia was sick, he was experimenting on her blood and he figured out a way to extract werewolf venom from her blood and put it in the virus.
Stefan: Wait.. what do you mean "werewolf venom?" That means it's fatal.
Elena: Oh my god..
Caroline: Hello! You don't think I would just drop this on you without a silver lining! There's an antidote. It just requires you to come meet me. I'll text you the address.
Stefan: Or you could just bring it over here.
Caroline: No. You have to go there. And don't ask me why, because I can't tell you.
Stefan: Caroline.. this doesn't make any sense.. Just tell me exactly..
Caroline: If I could tell you, don't you think I'd be there right now to help Elena? I'll text you the address!
Stefan: I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what is going on.
Caroline: The travelers don't want anyone to know what they're up to, and by "anyone," I mean "newbie, emo, witch" types, with bad attitudes. Just get there fast, okay?
Stefan: I'll see you later.
Elena: Stefan.
Stefan: Yeah?
Elena: Why did she stay?
Stefan: What do you mean?
Elena: Katherine.. why didn't she run like she normally does? Why did she stay?
Stefan: Uh.. You know, Katherine.. Staying alive wasn't enough. She wanted it all.
Elena: You mean you? She wanted you?
Elena: Did we... ever..
Stefan: Actually, we.. uh.. we kissed.
Elena: Oh. Okay. Um. And then?
Stefan: And then, I pulled away. And I put it together. She wasn't you.
Stefan: I gotta go.
BAR:
Liv: You gotta admit.. It was pretty rad. I locked a vampire in her dorm, with an invisible seal. I mean, how many newbie witches have that on their resume?
Bonnie: If they do, they don't brag about it as loudly.
Liv: AH. Come on. This place is dead. It's like, serious spring break-itis. Besides, you're not even a little proud of me?
Bonnie: Okay, hot shot.
Bonnie: Set it on fire.
Liv: What?
Bonnie: Simple fire spell..
Liv: Okay.
Liv: fes motis ignitum dos es sato
Liv: fes motis ignitum dos es sato
Liv: fes motis ignitum dos es sato
Bonnie: That's weird..I guess your resume still needs a little padding?
ROOM:
Voicemail: Hey. It's Aaron. Leave me a message, or don't. (*BEEP*)
: Hey. Aaron, it's Elena. I, um, ahem, I hope that you're off on some private island somewhere, enjoying your spring break. Look, a lot has happened. And I'd really like to talk about it, if you're still willing to talk to me.. So call me back, okay? Alright. Bye.
Katherine: Dear Diary, I love my life. Seriously, becoming Elena Gilbert is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
Elena: Oh my god!
Katherine: Spent the day on the road with Stefan, although the highlight was our little pit stop at the hotel. I had to wash up after "accidentally" getting grease on my shirt *laugh*
SEQUENCE:
: Oh well. I didn't like this shirt anyway.
Stefan: Uh.. Oh. woah, woah, whoa. A little Warning next time please?
Katherine: It's nothing you haven't seen before.
Stefan: I know, I'm just saying, there's a bathroom less than 10 feet away.
Katherine: You know, that's what I like about you, Stefan. Always the gentleman! You don't have to turn away, you know. There's nothing stopping us. We're both single now and we're alone.
Stefan: What are you doing
Elena: This isn't me Stefan? Can't you tell? After everything we've been through,  I wouldn't lead you on like that.
Elena: Damon?
Damon: Stefan, Stefan, Stefan.. "I have grease on my shirt. I need to wash up?" Come on, man! That's the oldest trick in the book.
Stefan: It's not like you saw through her.
Damon: I wasn't the one making out with her!
Elena: Stop it, okay? Both of you! This is what she wants. Even dead, she is ruining our lives!
Stefan: Oh? You think this is bad? You have no idea, do you?
Elena: About what? About what, Stefan?!
Elena: What the hell is happening to me?
STOCKYARD:
Stefan: He'll tell her.
Caroline: When?
Stefan: "Hey Elena, I killed Aaron." It's not exactly casual conversation.
Caroline: Killing someone in cold blood isn't casual, but Damon managed that just fine.
Enzo: Or I can just tell her.. considering I was lying in the road when he stopped his car.
Stefan: So.. what's in this for you, aside from getting Damon to undo every positive decison he's ever made.
Enzo: Is it such an anomaly for Damon to have a friend? Well, if so, consider me honored.
Caroline: Okay. We're here. Where is the antidote?
Stefan: Who are you?
Sloan: I'm Sloan. And you met some of the travelers when they were taking a bucket of your blood.
Stefan: Oh yeah. How could I forget? So, you have the antidote to the ripper virus, correct?
Sloan: We do, thanks to Enzo.
Enzo: I was trapped in that bloody farmhouse with Damon, set to have my head ripped off, when out of nowhere, Wes showed up with the travelers and saved my life on the condition that I owed him one.
Caroline: What does that have to do with us?
Enzo: He was running low on vampires and he needed one to continue his work, so I let him experiment on me. Among other things, it allowed him to make an antidote.
Sloan: When he died, the travelers took it. And seeing as Elena is valuable to us, we're in the process of using Wes' resources to find a cure for her virus as well.
Stefan: Alright. Fine. When will it be done?
Sloan: First, we have to find something.
Stefan: Okay. What do you need?
Sloan: Another one of you.
:
Damon: What do you mean, werewolf venom?
Elena: I mean, I'm deteriorating slowly. I seem to be hallucinating all of my worst fears. So.. that's been fun.
Damon: I should come over there.
Elena: You can't. We would tear each other apart, remember? Besides, I look gross.
Damon: Oh yeah? Well.. never mind. That would be awful.
Elena: Distract me.
Damon: Alright. What are you wearing?
Elena: Damon.. Come on. Tell me, what else have I missed?
Damon: Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see.. Umm.. It's been unseasonably cold; Jeremy bought a bunch of new x-box games that are ridiculously loud and obnoxious; Tyler had a party.. It was lame.. OH!  OH! OH! Have you heard the gossip?
Elena: What gossip?
Damon: Caroline and an original hybrid.. sitting in a tree.
Elena: No!
Damon: Yep!
Elena: Are you serious? Caroline and Klaus? I mean...
Damon: Mhmm.
Elena: Wait.. Does Tyler knows about this?
Damon: Yep. And guess who told him?
Elena: Katherine? Katherine is such a bitch.
Damon: That she is.
Elena: Sorry.. I..
Damon: Are you okay?
Elena: Um.. I just don't understand why Stefan's off at some mystery location. Why don't we just hunt down Wes and force him to make us an antidote.
Damon: Uh. That might be easier said than done. Wes is dead
Elena: What?
Damon: I killed him. And please don't act like he didn't deserve it!
Elena: What about Aaron, Damon? He didn't deserve that. Wes was pretty much the closest thing that Aarom had to family.
Matt: *unintelligible*
: The highlight of my day (to Elena) I'll check on you later, okay?
Elena: Yeah. Okay.
STOCKYARD:
Stefan: What do you mean, there's another one of me out there?
Enzo: You never stopped to think there might be another doppelgänger running around? Clearly, you don't know your traveler lore.
Caroline: I'm sorry, and you do?
Enzo: I've been stuck with them for the last few weeks and I've picked up on a few things; like how the last remaining pair of doppelgängers are special.
Caroline: Special? How?
Sloan: None of your business.
Enzo: You'll have to excuse Sloan. She's under a bit of stress. The leader of the travelers, Marcus, was it?
Sloan: Markos
Enzo: Markos, see. Wants the blood from the last remaining pair of doppelgängers, i.e. you and Elena.
Caroline: Why?
Enzo: They are special.
Stefan: Special, how?
Enzo: Don't think I didn't ask. I can witness that the travelers are very secretive, but what we do know is that until the last doppelgängers are out of the picture, your blood, when mixed with Elena's, doesn't do squat.
Stefan: So what? You do a locator spell until you find this guy and then you kill him?
Sloan: It's more of a linking spell.
Stefan: The last time a witch linked me to my doppelgänger, she fried my brain and I lost my memory.
Sloan: Then we better be careful.
ROOMS:
Elena: Aaron?
Aaron: Hey there!
Elena: I thought you were on spring break.
Aaron: Are you okay?
Elena: I'm sick. It's a long story. Look, I really wanted to talk to you about everything. Because the last couple of weeks, I haven't been myself. Literally. Katherine Pierce has been inside my body and.. uh..
Aaron: That would explain a lot actually.
Elena: Why? Did I do something?
Elena: Why is none of your stuff here?
Aaron: Because I'm not actually here.
Elena: What do you mean? Are you another hallucination?
Elena: Are you dead? Did I do this to you? Aaron.. tell me that I didn't kill you. Did I kill you? Tell me that I didn't kill you. Please. Tell me that I didn't kill you.
Luke: Elena!
Luke: Elena Gilbert! Wow. Get up, you clutz.
Luke: I see someone started their spring break early.
Elena: Uhh.. how did you get in here? I thought the door was closed.
Luke: David dumped my ass.. At Senior Frogs, of all horrifying places. He thought I was cheating on him, so I took the first flight out of Cancun and here I am.
Elena: Do I know you?
Luke: I'm Luke. We met at the bitter ball?
Luke: You're very drunk. Ahh. Let me shower off this airplane stench and we can drown our sorrows in rum runners.
Elena: No. Uh. That doesn't sound like a good idea.
Luke: Ahh! Don't tell me you and Stefan hooked up while I was gone.
Luke: Woah. Are you okay?
Elena: I'm just so thirsty.
Luke: We'll get some water alright.
Elena: Don't touch me.
Luke: You need help.
Elena: No. What I need is to feed.
Elena: Don't move. I need vampire blood.
Luke: What are you doing?
Elena: I have to turn you. Sorry.
Elena: What is that? What?
Luke: My paranoid boyfriend thought they were hickeys, but they're obviously some kind of a disgusting rash, or something.
Elena: Or, your "friend" "Elena" was feeding on you. Listen to me.. forget this conversation. Go find Bonnie Bennet and tell her to come here and bring the witch. I need to get out of here right now. Go!
:
Elena: I don't know what's happening to me, Damon.
Damon: I know. Look, you're sick. So just try to relax.
Elena: I feel like no one's telling me the truth. Damon, I can't tell what's real anymore.
Damon: Stefan will be there really soon.
Elena: I did it, didn't I? I killed him..
Damon: What?
Elena: Aaron! That's what you're so afraid to tell me! Aaron! I killed him.
Damon: Listen Elena, I will tell you everything, but right now is not the time.
Elena: Now is not the time? Damon, I'm dying! I almost turned a student today, who Katherine had apparently befriended, just so that I could feed on him. When would a good time be!!!? Huh?!
Damon: Elena... woah, woah, woah. Calm down. Listen to my voice. You will get through this. I will help you.
Elena: Nuh uh. No, No, No, No. You're lying to me, Damon. You're lying!
Damon: Elena, calm down! Please?!
Elena: Why is everyone lying to me? Why are you lying to me? Why is everyone lying to me?!
Damon: Donovan! Get your ass in here.
Matt: Chill! I'm right here! What?
Damon: My phone's dead. Charge it for me.
Matt: What? too much sexting with Elena?
Damon: How about you never say that again?
Matt: JEREMY!
Jeremy: Woah! What the hell?
Damon: I need to see your sister. Undo my chains, or I'll kill him.
Jeremy: I can't! You'll kill her.
Damon: She's going to hurt herself, Jeremy. She's totally unravelling.
Matt: Don't do it, Jeremy.
Damon: Stop being an idiot, Jeremy. Trust me. She needs me. I  would never hurt her, Jeremy.
STOCKYARD:
Caroline: Look, I know there's a lot of them, but between you, me and Enzo, I bet we can take em.
Stefan: Did you really just say that?
Caroline: Ugh. Sorry. I'm desperate.
Stefan: It'll be fine.
Caroline: Yeah, until you lose your memory again.
Stefan: Well, if I lose my memory, then I won't remember I had anything to worry about in the first place. See? Win/win.
Caroline: Who volunteers themselves for witchy electric shock therapy?
Stefan: Me... and I would do it for you too. Look.. let's just say that they do fry my brain.
Caroline: I'll kill them..
Stefan:' 'Right. And then you'll spiral out of control about killing them and then, do me a favor, remind me we were friends.
: That's for you, sit.
: Where are the antidotes?
Sloan: You'll get it when we're done.
Stefan:' 'No. You'll hand them over right now. I'm here.. I'm doing everything you want me to.
Enzo: I'll take them. I'll make sure the appropriate parties get them.
Enzo: If you don't trust me, you're welome to join, Goldilocks.
Caroline: No. I'm going to stay with Stefan.
Enzo: Very well. Best of luck.
: Wait! You said you weren't going to hurt him.
Sloan: No. I said I'd try not to hurt him. We need his blood for the spell.
Stefan:' 'Wait a second.. Tessa didn't need my blood when she linked me to Silas.
Sloan: Good for her. We do
ROOM:
: Elena.. What are you doing?
Elena: I'm cleansing myself of anything Katherine ever touched. Toothbrush, clothes, my sheets.
Bonnie: Elena. Stop. You're not yourself.
Elena: Well.. that's ironic. Because I wasn't myself for weeks and yet nobody noticed.
Liv: She's losing it..
Elena: Are you Liv? I'm sorry if we've met before, I'm really going to need you to drop that seal and let me out right now.
Bonnie: It's too dangerous to let you out in public when you're sick.
Elena: You think that's dangerous, Bonnie. If you don't drop the seal right now, I will kill you!
Bonnie: Elena! Stop. This is the virus.. It's in your head. Katherine wanted to destroy you and it's working! You have to fight it.
Elena: Oh my god. Oh my god. You're right, Bonnie. I can't.. I can't. I'm letting her win.. I'm not gonna let her win.
Bonnie: Oh my god. Elena!
Elena: You will die if I don't give you my blood to heal you. So, you're going to have to drop the seal. Otherwise, you're going to bleed to death. So.. it's your choice.
STOCKYARD:
Caroline: Why is this taking so long?
Sloan: Just a little deeper..
: You're going to be okay. Stay still.
nger: She's going into shock! I need the BBM
nger: Just stay with me.
Sloan: I see him. He's in a city.
Stefan: He's in Atlanta.
Caroline: Good! That's great! You found him!
Sloan: Keep going! Push harder!
Caroline: You said you know where he is! What are you doing?
Sloan: We're not done.
Sloan: The link isn't strong enough. We need more information
Caroline: You're pushing him too hard! he's going to lose everything. Stop!
Sloan: We need the doppelgänger dead. Louder!
Sloan: If you hurt me, they'll kill you.
Caroline: Tell them to stop. There's a way we can all get what we want.
WHITMORE:
Aaron: Elena?
Elena: Oh my god. Aaron, are you alive?
Aaron: You don't look so hot..
Elena: No. No. I'm good now. I'm good now! I thought I killed you.. I didn't kill you! You're right here! You're stll alive!
Damon: Elena.. Hey, it's Damon. You're hallucinating.
Damon: Here. Drink this (He hands her a cup of blood) It's Stefan blood. Drink this.
Elena: She won.. Katherine won.
Damon: Don't say that.
Elena: Look at me, Damon. Look at me! Look at me! The plague of Katherine Pierce lives on. She's turning me into something that I'm not.  I mean, look at me; I'm a monster. Liv.. the witch, I almost killed her! And my friends.. I want to kill my friends. I think I want to kill my friends
Damon: I'm here. It's okay
Elena: No! It's not okay! It's not okay, Damon! I... I killed Aaron Whitmore.
Damon: No.
Elena: I keep seeing him, he kees popping up everywhere. I'm hallucinating that Aaron's around.
Damon: Waitl! Look at me.
Damon: Look at me. You did not kill Aaron Whitmore. I did.
Elena: W-h-at.. What? Why.. was it because of the virus? Did you need to turn him?
Damon: It was before I was infected. Listen, if you want the specifics, it was the night that I thought you broke up with me, Elena. I killed him to convince myself that you were right. That I was the type of person that can kill in cold blood and I was never going to change. That's why.
Damon: I need you to say something..  Please?
Elena: Why is Enzo here?
Enzo: Sorry to interupt. I have the antidote. Although, from the looks of it, you'd both rather be dead.
:
Caroline: Hey.
Stefan: Hi. (jokingly) Rebekah? Hi.
Caroline: Oh my god...
Stefan: kidding! Lexi, right?
Caroline: It was funnier the first time!
Stefan: Did it work?
Enzo: The engine's running blondie. I appreciate the call. Let's go do this thing.
Stefan: Did I miss something?
Caroline: Sloan was going to fry your brain to kill your.. other you. I wsn't about to let that happen, so.. I may have volunteered to help Enzo deal with it.
Stefan: You mean... kill him?
Stefan: Caroline.. I can't let you
Caroline: They only want one alive, remember? It's you or him.
Stefan: Alright fine. Well, I'm coming with you.
Enzo: No mate. You aren't. They need to use you to get *unknown*. Tick tock, gorgeous. Time is of the essence.
Caroline: I'll be fine, Stefan. Besides, you'd do the same for me, right?
Stefan: I don't trust him..
Caroline: Don't worry. I don't either. I'll be safe, I promise.
COLLEGE:
Liv: I guess I should donate this shirt to Elena's fire cleanse.
Bonnie: I am so sorry about all of this.. I..
Liv: Hey. I survived my first vampire attack. I mean.. Just one more thing to add to the resume.
Bonnie: Look, if you don't want any part of this, I get it. Magic isn't for everyone. I won't be offended.
Liv: No. I want this and I want you to teach me.
Bonnie: Good, I'll see you tomorrow, bright and early for some levitation
Liv: Awesome! Catch you tomorrow.
Luke: Show off
Liv: Luke.. what the hell? I was just about to take my shirt off.
Luke: Relax! I'm gay AND your brother. So technically, you're the least attractive person in the world to me. Are you okay? Sorry I had to drag you into this, but Elena thought she was compelling me and, well, I couldn't give up the rouse.
Liv: I'm fine. After Elena gutted me, she gave me some of her blood.
Luke: And how is our precious anchor to the other side?
Liv: I'm letting her think she's teaching me magic. It's kind of cute
Luke: Until she realizes her friends are in jeporady... then, not so cute.
HOUSE:
Elena: No.
Damon: She speaks. Care to share anything else churning around in that beautiful head of yours?
Elena: You should've noticed.
Damon: What?
Elena: That I was Katherine.. Katherine was me. You should've been the one that noticed.
Damon: You don't think I know that?
Elena: If only you'd seen through her, Damon. There would be no vampire virus, Aaron would still be alive...
Damon: Katherine didn't do this. I did! I thought you broke my heart, so I ripped open Aaron's neck: THAT is how much control you have over me.
Elena: And I'm still here! That's how much control you have over me!
Damon: Listen to us! This is toxic! We are in a toxic relationship, Elena! I just killed your friend and you find someone else to blame!
Elena: You want me to blame you? Easy! Done! You screwed up, Damon. Again!
Damon: Thank you!
Elena: You put me in a position where I have to defend you, again, where I have to bend my morals, again. Where I have to go against every single thing thar I believe in, again, because I love you!
Damon: Then stop loving me!
Elena: I can't!
Damon: Well, that's the problem! We don't work!
Elena: I know..
Damon: Then we agree? This has to end.
Elena: It just did. It's over.. We're over.
