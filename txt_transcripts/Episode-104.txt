Nadia: Good evening sir, If I can trouble you for a moment.
Nadia: I'm looking for someone. Her name is Katerina Petrova. She was last seen outside of London in 1492. She's on the run. I need to find her.. I need to ask her why she abandoned me.
Katherine: Nadia..
Nadia: Please, I need to know.
Katherine: Nadia.. I'm right here. I'm right here.
Nadia: I was dreaming...of how I searched for you from village to village
Katherine: I know. I heard you. You said that I abandoned you... You were ripped from my arms as a baby. It's completely different!
Nadia: Not for a child without a mother.
Katherine: You know.. All this guilt is really taking all the fun out of this mother/daughter outing. I'm sorry Tyler bit you, but you're not going to die.
Nadia: Did you ask Klaus for his blood?
Katherine: Oh.. my. You really are delirious! Nadia, he would love nothing more than to watch my daughter die.
Nadia: ...And you don't want to risk being outed...
Katherine: No, I don't. So, that's why I called him.
Wes: Nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Maxfield.
Katherine: And luckily for us, he would love nothing more than studying your blood.
Wes: Werewolf venom isn't easy to come by!
Nadia: Get away from me!
Katherine: It's okay, Nadia, it's okay.
Wes: Listen to your mother. The venom in your blood is a toxin with basic chemical properties. Once I study its makeup, I can create the antidote.
Katherine: It's okay. Come on, Come on. Hey. Hey.
Nadia: If I'd known I just had to die to drag your attention from Stefan, I would've tried it a long time ago.
Katherine: If you're trying to make me feel guilty, it's almost working.
Nadia: I'm just glad you're here now.
Katherine: Me too. I'm going to be a better mother starting right now. I promise you, I'm going to save your life.
Damon: She is brilliant.
Stefan: We haven't noticed that Katherine's been inhabiting Elena's body for weeks, and that's all you have to say?
Damon: Yep.
Stefan: And you realize that it was Katherine who broke up with you. It wasn't, uh, Elena.
Damon: Mhmm.
Stefan: Right. So, your little murder spree with Enzo, where you, uh, killed Aaron, you nearly killed Jeremy, AND you tried to kill Wes, but you got infected with that ripper virus. That was all you reacting. To Katherine.
Damon: I'm trying figure out why you decided to tell a starving, bloodthirsty, vampire-feeding Ripper that his nemesis is still walking around, alive and well, while I'm stuck in this cell and can't do anything about it.
Stefan: I have it under control.
Damon: I would love to hear this.
UPSTAIRS:
Matt: Hang on here.. Katherine's still alive? How is that possible?
Caroline: Remember that time Nadia's ex, Gregor, hitched a ride in your head? Yeah, well, it's kind of the same thing. Katherine is a passenger in Elena, except it's worse, because none of us seemed to notice!
Tyler: She was at my house... How did none of us figure it out?
Caroline: Because it's Katherine and she's smart, and conniving, and sneaky... and we're the worst friends ever.
: This makes no sense. She saved my life. She gave me CPR when Enzo tried to kill me. Katherine would never do that.
Bonnie: That's what made her so believable. She played Elena to a tee. If she let you die, her cover was blown.
Caroline: I was sleeping three feet away from her! She picked out my Bitter Ball dress. And I let her use my toothpaste!
Stefan: Well, did she lure you into a hotel room to make out with you?
Tyler: 
Caroline: Of course! Oh my god!
Tyler: 
Stefan: Well, passengers can be expelled from the host. We saw it happen with Matt. Gregor died, and Matt lived. All we have to do is stab her with the Traveller knife.
Matt: I still have the knife Nadia gave me.
Stefan: Perfect! Go get it.
Caroline: Wait, you guys! This is Katherine we're talking about. She's going to see a sneak attack from a mile away. We've got to get her to come to us. Get her guard down, corner her.
Tyler: Fat chance you'll be seeing her today. I'm pretty sure I bit Nadia.
Matt: What do you mean, you bit her?
Tyler: I mean, she was attacking Caroline, and I might've nipped her a little.
Matt: And you're just mentioning this now?
Caroline: Hey guys! Focus. Tyler's right. Katherine's not going to leave Nadia's side, unless not leaving compromises her identity.
Matt: Which means...?
Caroline: We've got to invite her to something that Elena can't say no to.
Bonnie: A surprise party? Seriously? I wanted a spa day. You try feeling the death of every supernatural creature who passes through you on their way to the Other Side.
Jeremy: I'm not saying you don't deserve it. Besides her birthday isn't until next week.
: That's what makes it a surprise!
HOUSE:
Katherine: Yeah, I don't think Bonnie would want a big party for her birthday.
Caroline: ' Of course she does! So when can you get over to Stefan's to help us set up?
: I can't.
Caroline: You can't?
Katherine: I would love to, but I just... I can't? 
Caroline: 
: "Elena", you are so popular today.
: Hey Bonnie!
Bonnie: Hey, how's it going?
Katherine: You sound tired.
Bonnie: Yeah, I had to pull an all-nighter for my sociology exam, and then I woke up to a coven of dead Russian witches passsing through me on the way to the Other Side. 
Katherine: No, I-- I totally get it. It's--you're the anchor now. That must be...exhausting.
Bonnie: Do you want to maybe meet up for coffee or something? It's just one of those days, you know?
Katherine: Yeah. Well..
Bonnie: 
Katherine: Hey look, I'll check in with you later.
Bonnie: Okay. 
Katherine: 
CELLAR:
Damon: What are you doing?
Stefan: Here you go. Drink.
Damon: 
Stefan: Too bad.
Damon: That was nothing!
Stefan: That was exactly four ounces. When you were out killing vampires, you said one vampire kept you good for eight hours. So, our friend Caroline did a little bit of math.
Damon: Caroline?
Stefan: Relax, she had a calculator. So: four ounces, three times a day should be just enough to help you manage the hunger.
Damon: Manage me?
Stefan: So you don't rip anyone's head off. We'll deal with your crisis once we get Elena back.
Damon: I'll deal with my own crisis. Listen, you just let me out of here, I'll find Wes, I'll get the antidote.
Stefan: And then what? Huh? You skip town, leave it to me to tell Elena everything you did after you thought she broke up with you? No. [
Damon: Who you calling there, buddy?
Stefan: Katherine's been making a lot of excuses, and I have a feeling she won't be able to say no to me.
Stefan: It's your phone. "Elena" is calling. Answer it.
Damon: 
Katherine: Hey, um, how are you?
Damon: Oh you know, strung up, hungry, same old same old.
Katherine: Now that the dust has settled, I was hoping that, I don't know, maybe... we can talk about what happened at the farm house. Can I see you?
Damon: Okay. Sure. Why don't you just come to the house and we'll just talk about it here?
Katherine: Perfect. I'll see you soon.
Damon: Okay, bye.
Katherine: Damon knows that he tried to kill me less than 24 hours ago. There isn't a single vampire-craving bone in his body that would risk putting his precious "Elena" back in that kind of danger again.
Nadia: And yet, he is desperate to see her. Just like her other friends.
Katherine: 
Stefan: That doesn't make any sense. She's dodged anyone's attempt to try to get her over here, and now she voluntarily wants to come over?
Damon: Unless...
Stefan: Unless...
Damon: She was testing me. 
Nadia: Money for information. I was told you saw Katerina Petrova kill a man in cold-blood outside the quarter of Versailles. I want to know if that is true. I want to know what kind of person my mother is.
Nadia: She's been on the run for 228 years.
Katherine: You passed out in the car. I didn't want to wake you.
Nadia: Perfect. I can make my peace with the universe.
Katherine: Don't talk like that. I brought you here so that I can hide you until Wes finds a way to heal you.
Nadia: You should leave now, while you can. There is no point in trying to save me.
Katherine: I didn't raise you to be a quitter! And I promise as soon as you get better, we're leaving. Together.
Caroline: Of course. The farther she gets, the worse our chances of ever seeing Elena again. It's bad enough that we didn't recognize Katherine, we also blew our only advantage.
Damon: Nothing a little locator spell can't fix...
Liv: Let me guess.... matter of life and death?
Bonnie: Kind of, yeah. Um, do you remember that locator spell we did the other night?
Liv: Sure. It ended up saving 
Bonnie: Now, we need you to find his sister.
Liv: Why? She ran away from home?
Jeremy: No, she's been possessed by her evil doppelgänger.
Liv: Okay?
Bonnie: Liv, will you help us?
Liv: I can be convinced.
Damon: 
Tyler: You just had your lunch 30 minutes ago.
Damon: Or, you can give me a couple of sips of your hybrid juice, I can be on my way, and take my Ripper situation to Wes!
Tyler: Not going to happen.
Damon: Can I ask you a question? Without you getting all wolf-man on me?
Tyler: Do I have a choice?
Damon: Why are you still here?
Tyler: I'm a hybrid. and you need a babysitter
Damon: Oh no, here-here. In-Mystic-Falls-here. Your family is all dead, and I don't see you getting a job at the Grill. And, I don't see you in a Whitmore hoodie, either. Something tells me that there is a little masochistic voice in your head thats trying to convince you that you and Caroline still have a fighting chance in hell.
Tyler: 
Damon: Hmm, you're proabably right.
Damon: There's just one small difference between you and me. You wanna hear it?
Tyler: Not especially.
Damon: You see, even after all the terrible things that I do, Elena still chose me, because she's fighting for me. Caroline, on the other hand, chose the nuclear option. You know, that big red button that nukes your relationship once and for all. Well, sleeping with the guy that killed your mom was kind of her way of slamming her hand down.
Tyler: You think Elena will still want you back after this? It's over Damon, fix yourself and run far away.
Damon: I plan on it. How's New Orleans this time of year?
Tyler: You think Elena is going to forgive you? Look at you! You killed her friend, you almost killed her brother, you almost killed HER. You're a joke, Damon!
Damon: Says the guy pinning for the girl that slept with Klaus
Tyler: You dont know anything about me.
Damon: I know how to get you in this cell.
Caroline: Hey ready for the changing of the...
Tyler: 
Caroline: 
Tyler: I said, I'm fine!
Caroline: 
Tyler: Why do you think? Damon knew exactly how to piss me off.
Stefan: What the hell happened?
Tyler:  I think Damon went to go find Wes...
Liv: Elena's necklace, candle, and map...
Liv: Give me your hand.
Liv: You're Elena's brother. That makes you blood. So, hand it over.
Bonnie: Actually, he's her cousin. 
Liv: Whatever, close enough
Bonnie: That's...That's not how I taught you
Liv: Relax Mr? I'm feeling my way through it, okay? Now, what do I say again?
Bonnie:  Phasmatos Tribum, Nas Ex Veras, Sequitas Sanguinem.
Liv: Phasmatos Tribum, Nas Ex Veras, Sequitas Sanguinem.
Liv: Does Elena look anything like you?
Jeremy: Umm, same colored hair...
Liv: 
Bonnie: 
Liv: I'm sorry, I'm searching for his sister/cousin doppelgänger in my mind. I'll take all the help I can get.
Bonnie: 
Liv: 
Liv: Does your sister spend alot of time in church?
Nadia: You leaving?
Katherine: I'm going to check on Wes, he's taking to long.
Nadia: Be careful, they're all looking for you.
Katherine: 
Wes: Hello?
Damon: 
Wes: How did you find me?
Damon: I called my friend Enzo and asked him about the little adventure he had with you. Gotta say, long way off the tenure track, huh? I take it the Augeutine Society hit a bit of a rough streak?
Wes: There is no Augustine Society, Damon. It's just me
Damon: Well then, I guess you're my guy! Because, you see, I have this long road ahead of me to win my ex-girlfriend back. But, I dont have a chance in hell if I'm lusting over her blood, you follow?
Wes: Even if I did cure you of this virus, what difference does it make? So you stop feeding off your friends and you go back to feeding on innocent people. Is that really going to impress Elena Gilbert?
Damon: Look at me! You did this to me
Wes: I didn't do this to you! You are this. I simply held up the mirror.
Damon: It's my turn to play doctor.
FLASHBACK: SUMMER EUROPE WITH MATT
Nadia: That was fun.
Matt: You think?
Nadia: You must really trust Rebekah.
Matt: Huh?
Nadia: Watch this.
Nadia: I'm going to steal her earrings, and you are not going to say anything. 
Matt: 
Nadia: I recognized her on the dance floor. I was hoping she'd know something about her brother Klaus's favorite vampire... Katherine Pierce. Maybe you've heard of her?
Matt: 
Nadia: Because she is my mother, and I'd very much like to meet her. 
Katherine: Wes. What the hell is taking so lo-?
Katherine: 
Katherine: Nadia, I'm coming back to the church right now.
Stefan: 
Katherine: Stefan, why do you have Nadia's phone?
Stefan: She doesn't have much time left, Katherine.
Katherine: 
Stefan: I know that it's you, and I know that you care about Nadia. That's why I brought her here.
Katherine: Prove it. Put her on the phone.
Nadia: Katherine. Run.
Stefan: You can always run, Katherine. That's what you do best. Or, you can come home and see your daughter one last time before she dies. It's your choice.
Matt: Your hands are like ice.
Nadia: 
Matt: No, it's Matt, I'm not...
Nadia: Gregor, I'm sorry I betrayed you. I did it for my mother. I did everything for her.
Matt: 
Nadia: Forgive me?
Matt: 
Nadia: I don't wanna die.
Matt: Shh.
Nadia: I don't wanna die.
Nadia: What's gonna happen when I die?
Bonnie: I'll take your hand, and you'll go to the Other Side. Just like that.
Nadia: Will it hurt?
Bonnie: 
Katherine: I'm here to see my daughter.
Katherine: Nadia...
Nadia:You came back for me.
Katherine: I won't leave you again.
Nadia: Did you find a way to save me?
Katherine: Klaus's blood would have saved you...If I had asked for it.
Nadia:You would have outed yourself.
Katherine: But you would have been alive. And now it's too late.
Nadia: 
Katherine: You found me. Nadia, I'm right here.
Nadia: She's a liar and a murderer. She manipulates, she betrays...She'll do anything to survive.
Katherine: Nadia, no. I'm right here. Nadia, look at me. Look at me. I'm here, I'm right here.
Nadia: I'm looking for my mother.
Katherine: This is not what your life should have been. 500 years searching for a mother who ended up being me.
Katherine: Let me show you what your life should have been. What a perfect day would look like.
Katherine: You and I had a little cottage. It was an ordinary summer day. You were playing outside you were tired and it was time for bed. You told me about the fort that you'd built out in the woods by the river. So I asked if I could visit, and you said when the sun came out in the morning. And I said, goodnight Nadia.
Katherine: Sleep well.
Katherine: Your mother loves you.
Bonnie: 
Katherine: So. This is it.
Damon: 
Katherine: Okay. So...who's got the knife? Which one of you is gonna get to kill the elusive Katherine Pierce once and for all? 
Tyler: You've done nothing for me.
Katherine: Oh please, Tyler. If I hadn't walked into your life you just be a wasted nobody with a boozy mom and a temper problem.
Caroline: Hey, don't, don't.
: And you. I'm not worried about you offing me. Because we both know I made you better by making you a vampire.
Caroline: 
Katherine:  Bye, bye Caroline.
Katherine:  The one girl here who actually appreciates how beautiful you are. You wouldn't stab me in the heart, would you, Matty Blue? No, I don't think so. You will definitely go down as the best night I never had. Oh, well...
Matt:  Oh, well...
Katherine:  Well, little Gilbert, it was nice to have a brother for a second there...when you weren't being so damn annoying.
: Bon Bon, no need  for goodbyes. I'll see you on the flip side.
Katherine: Damon. How you would love nothing more than to drive that blade right through me.
Damon: We've already done that, Kitty Kat. I've said all I needed to say.
Katherine: I know but I never got to say what I needed to say to you. I'm sorry. You blame me for who you are. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I turned you. I'm sorry that you didn't get to die as a forgotten nobody on a bloody battlefield, and your father didn't get to live another day to be disgraced by you. Damon, I'm sorry that I gave you a life purpose. Passion, drive, desire. I'm sorry that you are who you are, because I'm the one that taught you how to love.
Damon: I'll see you in hell, Katherine.
Katherine: Stefan. You know, I've always wondered how it would be like to be loved by you. You've gotta admit, for that one fleeting moment....your feelings were real. It's truly has been the role of a lifetime. Stefan, I love you. And I've always loved you.
Katherine: Then I guess this is how...our love story ends.
Jeremy: Stefan said we should bury her in the woods.
Matt: Screw that.
Matt: She deserves better.
Jeremy: You need some help?
Matt: No, I got this.
Damon: Why is she not waking up?
Stefan: When Gregor left Matt's body, it took him a while to wake up, too. Which gives us a little bit of time to talk about what the hell you did.
Damon: Relax. Thanks to Tyler's friendly donation I'll be fine for a couple of hours.
Stefan: A few hours, huh? And then what? What's the plan?
Damon: Tell her everything I did.
Stefan: Optimistic.
Damon: I don't wanna be another Katherine Pierce. Katherine spent her whole life running from her problems only to die here. All alone.
Caroline: Is it wrong that I feel...
Tyler: Victorious?
Caroline: Sad. I know that Katherine is a horrible person but...
Tyler: But, you see the good in people.
Caroline: You mean Klaus. Because I saw the good in Klaus.
Tyler: Your words. Not mine.
Caroline: Your hybrid bite just killed someone and no one even batted an eye. I sleep with the wrong guy weeks ago and I don't hear the end of it. How is that fair?
Tyler: I don't know, Care. Maybe people just expect more from you?
Caroline: Why? Because "being good" comes so easy to me? Well guess what, Tyler, it doesn't! I am a vampire. I have the same impulses as you. So I'm allowed to make some mistakes along the way. Yes, I slept with Klaus. But after you walked away from me. That was my choice and I'm living with it, and I don't need to be hearing about it every five seconds. So, just get over it or get out of my life, but I'm done feeling guilty.
Bonnie: This is for you, Dad. I want you to know how much I miss you.
Katherine: You gotta be kidding me, right? Something tells me I'm five centuries too late on the whole "believing in a higher power" thing.
Bonnie: Well, you're here. That means it worked. You're dead.
Katherine: True. But again...your friends didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. Using my own daughter against me? Harsh. I suppose I could have spend the next five hundred years running...but for what? My daughter was dying. Stefan would never love me. I was back to having nothing. And Elena wins again.
Bonnie: Let's get this over with.
Katherine: I am really starting to get sick of Elena getting everything that I want.
Bonnie: What is that supposed to mean?
Katherine: Wes had no intention of helping Nadia.
: You can always run, Katherine. It's your choice.
recording: A good day. I managed to extract the werewolf venom from Nadia Petrova's blood. The addition of the venom will make the ripper virus even more lethal to vampires.
Katherine: He was just using her as a case study in his project to wipe out vampires of the face of the earth.
Bonnie: Why are you telling me this?
Stefan: Hey!
Damon: Elena?
: I've said it before and I say it again.
Katherine: Elena had the life I always wanted. Well, until now.
Bonnie: Katherine, what did you do?
Katherine: Stefan thought he gave me a choice. Run, or die.
: But that's not really much of a choice, is it? After all Nadia was the only person in this world who really loved me. And I wasn't about to let my daughter die alone.
Katherine: But Katherine Pierce wasn't about to go gentle either.
Elena: Hi!
Damon: Are you...you?
Elena: Yeah. Yeah, it's me. I'm here.
: I left Elena with a bit of a parting gift.
Katherine: If I can't have Stefan, then no one can. 
Katherine: Nothing's happening. What's wrong?
Bonnie: I don't know. This has never happened before.
Katherine: Bonnie, what are you doing? Let me pass through! Why won't you let me pass through?
Bonnie: I don't know. I don't control it.
Katherine: What?
Bonnie: It's not up to me.
Katherine: Then who is it up to?
Katherine: Bonnie.
Bonnie: I can't help you, Katherine.
Katherine: What....
Katherine: No, no, no, no
: No! Noooooooooo!!!!
