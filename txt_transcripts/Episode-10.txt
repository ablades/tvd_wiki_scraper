Jenna: Why are you here, Logan?
Logan: I missed you. I was out of town. I...
Jenna: Yeah, I got that email.
Logan: 
Jenna: You didn’t send an email?
Logan: I can explain. Just invite me in and I'll tell you everything.
Jenna: I’m not gonna invite you in. Forget it.
Logan: Come on, Jenna. It’s me.
Jenna: The answer's no.
Logan: I know you. You’re always one step from a "maybe", a tiny nudge to "yes".
Jenna: 
Logan: Evening.
Daphne: 
Logan: I took some time off.
Daphne: I noticed. I’m Daphne.
Logan: Hey you know something, Daphne?
Daphne: No, what?
Jeremy: "I live in fear. It consumes me. In the early evening when I see the sun begin to fade, the fear comes, because I know that the night brings death."
Elena: Jeremy's got his sketch pad out.
Jenna: You’re kidding?
Elena: Nope. But don’t say a word. The minute we encourage him, he’ll put it away.
Jenna: Psychology major. Check that!
Jenna: You and Stefan? Update?
Elena: 
Jenna: Where is he going?
Elena: I've stopped asking questions. The answers get scary.
Jenna: Yours leaves, mine returns.
Elena: Logan?
Jenna: He’s back. 
Elena: I hope you slammed it in his face.
Jenna: Ah, medium slam.
Elena: Three strike rule, Jenna. You're not even aloud to watch the news.
Jenna: Exactly. No more Logan "Scum" Fell.
Stefan: So any idea of where you'll go?
Damon: I don’t know. London, maybe. See some friends.
Stefan: You don’t have any friends, Damon.
Damon: You’re right, Stefan. I only have you. 
Stefan: We are not going anywhere. I’m gonna live my life as far away from you as possible.
Damon: 
Stefan: Mmmm, that's funny. Seriously, where are you going? Because we are not staying in this town.
Forbes: I’m here to see Damon.
Stefan: Uh, sure. Ok.
Damon: Sheriff. What a surprise.
Forbes: Sorry to bother you, but we need to talk.
Damon: Come in.
Damon: Um, I hope you understand the secrecy. Stefan doesn’t know about this yet and I’d like to keep it that way.
Forbes: Of course, kids are too young to be brought into this.
Damon: So, what do you need?
Forbes: There’s been another attack. A female victim, her throat torn out, completely drained of blood. It fits the pattern.
Damon: I’m sorry. I don’t understand. I thought we solved that problem when I 
Forbes: I'm thinking she must have turned someone. Or multiple someones. I don’t know.
Forbes: The story for the town is another animal attack but I’m not sure how long we can keep lying to them. The council is in an uproar. We thought we were past this.
Damon: So, uh, what do we do?
Forbes: You’re the only one who's ever taken on a vampire. We were hoping you could tell us.
Matt: And then the ballet dancer and the Krumper did the salsa.
Caroline: Well, I was awake for that part.
Matt: Well, I don’t know when you fell asleep. Umm, did you see the Celine Dion waltz about cancer?
Caroline: Those always make me cry!
Matt: Yeah, and then the loud judge kept screaming and I couldn't take it, so I turned it off.
Caroline: I sat through Family Guy. 
Elena: Did I miss something?
Bonnie: They’ve been hanging out.
Elena: Kind of weird, don’t you think?
Bonnie: She needs someone nice like him, as opposed to a homicidal vampire like Damon.
Elena: Yeah, how are you doing with all that?
Bonnie: I’m freaked out. Damon attacked me. I could be dead right now. But I'm also grateful.
Elena: Hmm?
Bonnie: To Stefan. He saved my life and...Have you seen him?
Elena: 
Bonnie: He wouldn’t leave without saying goodbye.
Elena: 
Bonnie: So, what are you gonna do?
Elena: What am I supposed to do? I’ve already begged him not to go. If I ask again, I’m being selfish. It is what it is.
Bonnie: Maybe it’s for the best.
Elena: What? Why?
Bonnie: I mean, what kind of future could you have had with him, even if he stayed?
Elena: Did you just...?
Bonnie: No, I swear.
Elena: Oh, God.
Damon: Thank you for stopping by.
Forbes: Let me know what you come up with.
Damon: Absolutely.
Stefan: What is wrong with you? You killed somebody?
Damon: Get off of me. 
Stefan: That’s impossible.
Damon: Obviously not.
Stefan: Then, who could it be?
Damon: Ah, what do we care? We’re leaving anyway, right?
Stefan: No, I can’t leave now and you know that. 
Damon: Let the adults handle this, Stefan.
Elena: See you later, ok?
Girl: Bye.
Elena: Bye.
Stefan: Hi. 
Tyler: So, what’s up with you and Forbes?
Matt: Nothing's up.
Tyler: I saw you two in the hall today. Don’t even try to deny it, bro. You're tapping that.
Matt: No, it’s not like that.
Tyler: Never is. Until you become "we" people.
Matt: "We" people?
Tyler: Yeah, "we can't make it to the party"; "we'll never miss a game"; "we don’t like the color red"
Matt: We hung out, like, twice.
Tyler: Like I said, "we."
Elena: So, you have no idea who it could be?
Stefan: None. But it must be somebody new because leaving a body like that, they're either sloppy or they're trying to send a message.
Elena: And you're sure it’s not Damon?
Stefan: Well, I’m never sure about Damon, but he’s been trying to keep a low profile lately, so it’s just doesn’t make any sense to me.
Elena: So what are you gonna do?
Stefan: Damon is tracking them right now. 
Elena: When I saw you, I...thought you were coming to say goodbye.
Stefan: Not yet.
Jeremy: Hey, what do you think?
Jenna: 
Jeremy: I found this old journal in dad’s stuff, Johnathan Gilbert from the 1800s. He's kind of a freak show. 
Jenna: Yeah, he was a writer...short stories, horror stuff.
Jeremy: Oh, he wrote fiction? Figured he was just a lunatic or a drunk.
Jenna: Well, he was a Gilbert, probably a little bit of both.
Caroline: So what do I do now?
Damon: Just wait. I’ll be there in minute.
Caroline: Can you hurry? I have things to do.
Damon: You can give me that.
Caroline: So, why did you need me to do this?
Damon: Because I interfere with the signal.
Caroline: Can I go now? This has blown, like, half of my day.
Damon: You do that. 
Caroline: 
Damon: Bye.
Logan: I have tons of these wood bullets, so nothing funky.
Damon: You don’t wanna do this, trust me.
Logan: That’s what you get.
Damon: For what?
Logan: 
Damon: I killed you. I didn’t turn you.
Logan: See I know what you and your brother are. I’ve been watching the two of you. I knew you'd show up here and I'm glad you did, because I have some questions.
Damon: 
Logan: 
Damon: It happens. 
Logan: You bit me.
Damon: 
Logan: It had to be you.
Damon: You have to have vampire blood in your system when you die. I didn’t do that. Some other vampire found you, gave you their blood.
Logan: Who?
Damon: That’s what I wanna know.
Logan: Dude, it’s not like the welcome wagon was waiting with a bundt cake and a handbook. It’s been a learn as you go process. You know, one minute, I’m a small town on the rise news guy and next thing I know, I can’t get into my house, because my foot won’t go through the door.
Damon: 
Logan: I know. I live alone.
Damon: Ah, 
Logan: So now, I am at the Ramada, watching pay per view all day, eating everything in sight, including housekeeping.
Damon: It could be worse.
Logan: All I can think about is blood and killing people. I can’t stop killing people. I keep killing 
Damon: Welcome to the club.
Damon: Wait a minute. Cops only found one body.
Logan: I left one. I was tired. But I’ve been hiding the rest of bodies. They're right back there.
Damon: You're kidding.
Logan: They're just piling up!
Lockwood: So what do we know?
Forbes: Nothing new to report yet. 
Lockwood: 
Forbes: For right now, there is nowhere safer than a crowded public place, and for once, Mayor, we actually know where our kids are.
Tyler: What do you want?
Jeremy: Hey. Uh, I’m just surprised to see you here. 
Tyler: Go to hell.
Elena: Still wanna be an astronaut?
Matt: I can’t believe you remember that.
Elena: I can remember the tinfoil that you wore on your head.
Matt: I was eight.
Elena: How are you doing?
Matt: I've had it easier. You? I heard some things. 
Elena: Yeah, it is.
Elena: What about you, Matt Donovan? I heard about Caroline.
Matt: Aw, man, not you too.
Elena: Hey.
Matt: We’re friends. 
Elena: No?
Matt: No.
Logan: Why am I so overly emotional? All I can think about is my ex-girlfriend. I wanna be with her and bite her and stuff.
Damon: Well, you probably love her. Anything you felt before will be magnified now. You're gonna have to learn how to control that.
Logan: What about walking in the sun? I’m a morning person. You can walk in the sun which, by the way, is pretty cool. 
Damon: The journals?
Logan: Yeah, the founding fathers, they passed down journals to their kids. Come on man, you gotta tell me. How can you walk around in the sun?
Damon: Who turned you?
Logan: How do you walk in the sun?
Damon: Who turned you?
Logan: You know, I’ve been really nice so far but I will kill you.
Damon: Then you'll never know. 
Logan: You first!
Damon: It seems we're at a bit of an impasse then, doesn’t it?
Logan: I have things to do, people to kill. Guess I'll be needing a little head start.
Elena: I’m guessing you’re not here to plan the path for your future. 
Stefan: Hope that’s ok.
Stefan: You know I wanted to be a doctor before everything happened, but, uh, then I couldn’t, 'cause...
Elena: The blood.
Stefan: Yeah. I’ve dabbled in a bunch of different things, though.
Elena: Didn’t love anything enough to stick to it?
Stefan: No, I...I loved it all. I just...I had to move on before anybody could notice that I wasn’t getting any older.
Elena: How long before that would happen?
Stefan: Few years, usually. Sometimes shorter.
Elena: 
Stefan: I didn't have a choice.
Stefan: 
Elena: 
Stefan: Elena, it’s not that I don’t wanna be in it.
Elena: You can’t, I get it. I heard you the first time and the second time, and I appreciate you looking out for me but, please, if you’re gonna leave, then just go.
Jenna: Hide me.
Elena: What’s going on?
Jenna: The scum Fell has landed.
Elena: Logan’s here.
Stefan: 
Elena: Stefan, what’s going on?
Logan: Jenna, are you dodging me?
Jenna: It’s a form of self-preservation.
Stefan: Um, Elena, why don't you and Jenna go somewhere else?
Elena: Let’s go.
Stefan: What are you doing here?
Logan: You know, your brother asked me the same thing. In fact, why don’t we just skip past all that who turned me stuff and get the answer that I want? How can I turn into a day walker?
Stefan: Damon and I are the only two that I know of.
Logan: But you're both very cagey on the how, which tells me that there is a way. You know, in case you hadn't noticed, I’m quite the celebrity in this town. It would be very, very easy for me to expose you.
Stefan: You wanna know how you can walk around in the sun?
Logan: I do.
Stefan: You can’t. Don’t ever threaten me again.
Elena: When Logan came to the house, what did he say?
Jenna: Fake flattery. Stupid, dimpled grin. Puppy dog eyes.
Elena: I’m serious, Jenna. How did he act? What did he say?
Jenna: He was the usual Logan, was charming, a little more manic than usual. He kept trying to convince me to let him in. 
Elena: Ok, listen to me very carefully. Do not, under any circumstances, talk to him again. I’m serious, Jenna, like ever!
Alaric: Hey Elena. Jenna
Elena: Hi Mr. Saltzman.
Alaric: 
Jenna: Career night is the new bowling.
Elena: Ok, um, excuse me.
Damon: Logan Fell is a vampire and when I find him again, I’m gonna destroy him limb by limb.
Stefan: 
Damon: No, I'm not ok. I was ambushed. I was shot. 
Stefan: Well, there's no need. He’s here at the school.
Damon: You’re kidding me. Why the hell is he there?
Stefan: He’s working the crowd.
Damon: Well, I’ll be right there.
Elena: 
Forbes: What are you doing?
Caroline: Following my future. 
Forbes: Broadcast journalism?
Caroline: Yes. Broadcast journalism. 
Forbes: You don’t even read the paper.
Logan: Liz.
Forbes: 
Logan: What are you gonna do stake me? Bury me in another shallow grave? What would the email say this time?
Forbes: I didn't have a choice.
Logan: 
Forbes: You knew what you were getting into.
Logan: I was one of you.
Forbes: And now you're one of them.
Logan: Watch your back, Sheriff.
Forbes: Get a backup team to the school immediately. Keep it within the circle. It’s a V5.
Jeremy: I didn’t know you drew.
Tyler: It’s an elective.
Jeremy: Because it’s good stuff. You like graphics? Cause that's, uh, that's kind of my thing.
Tyler: 
Jeremy: 
Tyler: What’s the other thing? Vicki? Let’s hang out because we did the same chick? Go be friends with one of the many other guys that she screwed, there is no shortage of them.
Alaric: 
Lockwood: You two, follow me.
Alaric: Excuse me, Mayor. 
Lockwood: I’m gonna talk to them. All fights should end in handshakes, don’t you think? 
Caroline: Bonnie, where are you? I’m ready to go. I’ll be outside.
Logan: Hey, damsel in distress, need a ride?
Caroline: 
Logan: I used to baby sit you, Caroline Forbes. Don’t mock me.
Caroline: Well, I was supposed to go home with Bonnie, but I can’t find her.
Logan: It's not a problem, really. It’s on my way.
Caroline: Okay.
Caroline: You know, this is fate.
Logan: And why is that?
Caroline: Because I’m interested in broadcast journalism. So can I ask you a couple questions?
Logan: Anything you want. But first, buckle up.
Caroline: Ok.
Matt: Hey.
Elena: 
Matt: Yeah. He just gave Caroline a ride home.
Stefan: Stay here.
Lockwood: Ok, let’s get this out of your system. Go ahead. Fight.
Jeremy: You want us to what?
Tyler: I’m not gonna fight him, dad.
Jeremy: I don’t think so, sir.
Lockwood: You don't fight in there like pansies. You take it outside, fight your battles like men, and move on. Best lesson my dad taught me. So let’s settle it. Fight.
Tyler: Come on, dad.
Jeremy: That's not gonna happen.
Lockwood: I said fight!
Alaric: Whoa. What’s going on out here?
Lockwood: Just letting these two kids work it out. We’re good here. Go back inside.
Alaric: I don’t wanna go back inside. What I want is an answer to my question. What’s going on out here?
Lockwood: Who do you think you’re talking to? Do I look like a student?
Alaric: No. You look like a full grown alpha male douchebag.
Lockwood: You don't talk to me like that. I can have your job like this. 
Alaric: Ah, you do that. Then it will be you and me in this parking lot, working things out. You cool with that?
Lockwood: You just marked yourself.
Alaric: Ok.
Alaric: 
Forbes: Where are you?
Logan: Your daughter has expressed an interest in journalism. I think it’s important to foster young minds.
Forbes: What do you want?
Logan: The satisfaction of turning your daughter into a vampire.
Damon: Payback's a bitch, isn't it? 
: Logan, what happened?! Logan?
: Sheriff, yeah, it’s Damon.
: Where is Caroline?
: She’s ok. I’m on Elm Street.
Damon: Gonna try this one more time. 
Logan: I told you I don’t know.
Damon: 
Logan: How can you side with them?
Damon: I don't side with anyone. You pissed me off. I want you dead. Who turned you?
Logan: I don’t know!
Damon: Oh, well. You're screwed.
Logan: Wait, wait! I do know.
Damon: You’re lying.
Logan: You think you’re the only one who wants to get in that tomb underneath the old church?
Damon: If you're lying to me, I will end you.
Logan: I am not lying. There is another way to break the spell. We can help you. Meet me at the old church.
Damon: Take me down. Make it look real. Make it look real!
Forbes: Where is she?
Damon: She’s ok. My brother's taken her home. I’m sorry, Sheriff. I just wasn’t strong enough.
Elena: Caroline?
Stefan: She‘s ok. I took her home. She was shaken up. But all she knows is Logan attacked her. Nothing else.
Elena: Where's Logan?
Stefan: Damon's dealing with him.
Elena: As in...?
Stefan: You saw what happened tonight, right? 
Elena: Yeah, I’m starting to see a lot of things, Stefan. Come on. I’ll, uh, I'll give you a ride.
Stefan: Uh, I can get home.
Elena: I know.
Stefan: All right. That'd be nice.
Jeremy: Hey.
Tyler: What do you want?
Jeremy: I don’t know. I, uh, I thought that was weird with your dad, what he did. Is he like that all the time? Is that...Is that what you gotta go through? Man, I...I get it. I get it. 
Tyler: Look, I don’t need your pity.
Jeremy: Seriously, you don’t have to be like this. You don't.
Tyler: Just go.
Jeremy: What is your problem, man?
Tyler: I don’t know, ok? I don’t know.
Elena: What I said before about you leaving. It was harsh.
Stefan: No, no. You had every right.
Elena: You asked me what I wanted my future to be. I wanted to be a writer. My mom sort of push me into that direction from the time I was able to read. She supported me, encouraged me, bought me my first journal, and then she died. And I can’t see myself being a writer anymore. That was something that we shared. I know that you think you put all of this bad stuff into my life, but my life already had it. I was buried in it.
Stefan: This is different.
Elena: It doesn’t make it any less painful.
Stefan: I know that it’s...that's it's hard to understand, but I’m doing this for you.
Elena: No.
Elena: You don’t get to make that decision for me. If you walk away, it’s for you, because I know what I want. Stefan, I love you.
Elena: Don’t.
Stefan: Elena, I can’t...
Elena: Yes, you can. 
Logan: Who are you?
Alaric: A friend of Jenna's.
Logan: Jenna sent you?
Alaric: No, I came on my own.
Logan: Ah, I get it. Well, buddy, I know you think this makes you brave. But actually it makes you pretty stupid.
Alaric: Either way, here I am.
Logan: What do you want?
Alaric: Jenna is a good person. She deserves the best. I'm here to make sure she gets it.
Logan: Was that supposed to be a threat? Couldn't you throw a punch? Maybe provoke me a little?
Alaric: I’m not a violent guy by design.
Logan: Well, you’re not a very smart one, either.
Alaric: How’s that?
Logan: 'Cause you have no idea who you're talking to.
Tyler: I need a ride
Matt: Sure.
Matt: Look, I like Caroline. 
Tyler: Ok.
Matt: So stop your little bromance bitch act.
Tyler: 
Forbes: Yeah, I’ll be right there.
Elena: I’ve never been in your room before.
Stefan: Hm, well, it hasn’t changed much over the years.
Elena: Do you leave everything here when you come and go?
Stefan: It’s the only place that...that has remained constant. This room holds every memory that I've ever thought was important enough to hold on to.
Elena: A lot of memories.
Stefan: Yep. Are you thirsty or anything?
Elena: A little. You? Uh...
Stefan: I’m fine. Let me get you something to drink, ok?
Elena: Ok.
Damon: Hello.
Forbes: I just wanted to say thank you. I don’t know how you did it.
Damon: Um, not following.
Forbes: We found Logan’s body up by the old Fell warehouse. He has been disposed of. He was hoarding victims, innocent victims.
Damon: What?
Forbes: This town owes you so much. So do I.
Stefan: Elena?
