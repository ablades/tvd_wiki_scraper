BONNIE: You just killed your whole family?
KAI: Who names a kid Malachai? It's like they expected me to be evil. I linked Elena's life to yours, and the rule is, as long as you're alive, Elena will remain asleep.
BONNIE: You're gonna be human. Enzo!
SYBIL: Surely you've heard of the legend of Arcadius. You know him by another name-- the devil. Cade. How are you here?
: The bell rang 11 times. Enough for me to pay a visit.
STEFAN: I just came home to change before I go to Bonnie's. Spent the last hour trying to figure out what I was gonna say to her. If I can't figure out a way to forgive myself, I can't expect her to.
DAMON: Bonnie's a much better person than you or me.
ETHAN: What is this?
DAMON: A relic of Cade's creation that is the means to destroy him? Now that has a certain poetry to it. I say we make a plan to kill the devil.
KAI: Yeah, sorry to interrupt, but what if I told you I had a better idea?
MATT: Dad, get up! Come on, Dad! Do something, please!
MATT: Nine. This thing’s heating up! Ten. Dad, come on! Eleven.
KAI: Hey, where am I?
WAITER: Mystic Falls? The Grill?
KAI: Is it too late, to order food?
KAI: beer, burger. Two burgers. No. No. Two beers, three burgers. Are the fries here good? I remember them being a little soggy. Oh, and a hot dog! A hot dog. Is that... is that crazy? Whatever. I'll do it. Dog me. It's my special day, I am here, and here is not hell, and that means that I am alive, so... thank you. 
KAI: It doesn't taste like anything. 
KAI: Come on, come on. Come on, come on, Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Okay.
KAI: I can't feel anything. I'm not here. I'm not alive.
WAITER: Okay, here's that beer.
KAI: Motus
KAI: Well... at least I felt that.
KAI: is that weird or what? I mean, I can still touch stuff. I'm not a ghost. More like a psychic imprint. Stuck between dimensions thanks to hell's bell. One foot on Earth, the other in Cade's nightmare world of hurt. On the run, off the grid A renegade relying only on his wits. (laughs) A renegade. That's funny. I can still do magic if I siphon myself, but even then, it takes concentration.
