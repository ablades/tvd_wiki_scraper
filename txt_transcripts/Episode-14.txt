Ben: I wouldn't.
Ben: Don't try to escape. Don't even move. Do you understand?
Elena: I understand.
Anna: Seriously?!
Ben: I told her not to move! I did that eye thing that you taught me!
Anna: And forgot the lesson about vervain! She dates a vampire, Ben. Duh!
Elena: Who are you? What do you want?
Anna: Does it matter?
Elena: Bonnie? 
Stefan: Anna took Elena.
Damon: Yeah, I got that from your 600 voice mails.
Stefan: Damon, all night long, every single street in town, I've been searching. What if your blood hasn't passed out of her system?
Damon: Well, then at least you know you'll see her again.
Stefan: Please. 
Damon: 
Stefan: You know, all I can remember is hating you. There might have been a time when that was different, but your choices have erased anything good about you. 
Damon: Apology accepted.
Stefan: So please, just tell me what you know.
Damon: Huh.
Stefan: 
Damon: I mean this sincerely. 
Elena: Bonnie?
Bonnie: Elena?
Elena: Oh, you're okay!
Bonnie: My head...
Elena: Come here.
Bonnie: Oh my god! Ben is a-!
Elena: Shhhh.
Elena: They can hear.
Bonnie: I'm so stupid!
Elena: No, he had all of us fooled!
Bonnie: What's going on? Why are we here?
Elena: It must have something to do with the tomb and Emily's spell book.
Bonnie: Spell book?
Elena: Damon said it could be used to open the tomb.
Bonnie: Why didn't I know about any of this?
Elena: I was trying to keep you out of it, hoping it would never come to this.
Bonnie: Come to what?
Elena: They need a witch to break the spell and let the vampires out.
Bonnie: No way!
Elena: I know.
Bonnie: You're wasting your time. I'm not gonna help you.
Ben: That's why she's here. Motivation for you to behave. You know, you shouldn't be so desperate. You made it too easy.
Ben: She wants to talk to you.
Anna: Well, well. Elena Gilbert. You really are Katherine's doppelgänger. You must have the Salvatore boys reeling.
Elena: Who are you?
Anna: I'm Anna. Your brother may have mentioned me. 
Tyler: Ten kegs? You know how much damage we could do with ten kegs? Duke's got it all hooked up.
Matt: Duke's a douche.
Tyler: Yeah, a douche with ten kegs. Aka, my new best friend.
Tyler: What's the problem, Gilbert?
Jeremy: Don't have one, Lockwood.
Tyler: Yeah, I didn't think so.
Matt: Do you ever get bored of it?
Tyler: Of what?
Matt: Yourself.
Tyler: Keep laughing, buddy.
Caroline: Hey, Jeremy. Where is Elena? I've been texting her and Bonnie all day about Duke's party.
Jeremy: Uh, she went somewhere with Stefan.
Caroline: 
Jeremy: Who is Duke?
Caroline: Some guy that graduated a couple of years ago. And he throws a party every time he comes home from Duke.
Jeremy: Wait, Duke goes to Duke?
Caroline: His real name's Bob or something. 
Jeremy: Uh, yeah, I - I don't think so.
Caroline: No, seriously. Everyone goes. Even quiet loner little brothers. 
Caroline: Hey!
Matt: Hey.
Caroline: So, I have a speech. It is fully scripted and well-rehearsed. Are you ready for it?
Matt: You wrote a speech?
Caroline: Yes. It's a "You kissed me and I don't want things to be weird" speech. It's preemptive.
Matt: 
Caroline: Yeah, you know, in case you were having second thoughts or regrets, or were, like, ooged out-
Matt: Ooged, huh?
Caroline: Can I just get on with the speech part?
Matt: Yeah, go for it.
Caroline: So I know that you don't think that this is going to work out between us. I just want to let you know that right here and right now, I'm offering you an out. Like an escape clause.
Matt: Why are you giving me an escape clause?
Caroline: I don't wanna make assumptions about what it is we're doing here.
Matt: Got it.
Caroline: So, if you would like to exercise it, just let me know.
Matt: I'm good, but thanks.
Caroline: Okay. Good.
Matt: Yeah.
Caroline: So, see you for Duke's tonight.
Matt: Yeah.
Grams: Yes?
Damon: Hi there. I'm, uh, looking for Bonnie.
Grams: She's not here.
Damon: Oh, well do you know when she-
Grams: Never.
Damon: 
Grams: You got some nerve knocking on a Bennett witch's door and asking her for anything.
Damon: What'd I do?
Grams: Spirits talk, Mr. Salvatore, and so does my granddaughter. You are no friend to us. Now get off my porch.
Damon: Step outside and say that.
Grams: I am not Bonnie. You don't wanna mess with me.
Elena: Bonnie's not gonna open the tomb.
Anna: Oh, I think she will.
Elena: Do you really want Katherine out that bad?
Anna: Trust me. No one I know wants to see that girl again. Except Damon, the lovestruck idiot.
Elena: Then what is it? Or who is it?
Anna: My mother's in there. 
Elena: 
Anna: You really mean that, don't you? 
Elena: Which is what?
Anna: Leverage. This belong to you?
Anna: Ah-ah!
Stefan: Elena? Are you okay?
Anna: She's fine. For now. Tell me you have the grimoire and she'll stay fine.
Stefan: I can get it.
Anna: Which means your brother has it. And I have the witch. So one of you had better meet me in the very public town square in 30 minutes so we can safely discuss how fun it's gonna be to work together.
Damon: Go ahead. Grovel again. Oh, wait no...I don't care.
Anna: I'm leaving.
Anna: Keep them buttoned down. Compulsion won't work. Just use violence.
Ben: Right. I got that.
Ben: Sit. Behave. 
Elena: Is there anything to drink here?
Ben: Are you offering? There's water on the night stand.
Bonnie: Hey. Can I have a sip?
Ben: Come back in! Shut the door!
Bonnie: Don't hurt her!
Ben: Don't make me!
Ben: Lock it!
Jeremy: Anna! Hey-uh, what happened to you last night?
Anna: Sorry, I had to leave. I told your sister to tell you.
Jeremy: I haven't seen her.
Anna: Well, I gotta run, so-
Jeremy: Hey, do you wanna go to a party tonight?
Anna: Go to what?
Jeremy: Oh, the guy who's throwing it is a total douche, but it's supposed to be fun. I figured, you know, safety in numbers.
Anna: 
Jeremy: It's been a while since I've been to a party, and I kind of want to get back out there. And not be such a - a loner. And, uh, I like you. You're fun, and you're also kind of strange and lurky but, uh, I guess I like that, too. So, yeah, you should come to the party. With me. It's in the woods by that old cemetery.
Anna: Oh. It's there, huh? That sounds cool. Uh, I'll meet you.
Jeremy: Oh. Okay! Great.
Jeremy: Cool.
Anna: Okay.
Damon: Got a hot date or are you just plan on nabbing the entire Gilbert family?
Anna: A party, right next to the old cemetery. Isn't that nice of them? Lots of warm bodies for starving vampires.
Damon: I told you. I work alone.
Anna: Yeah, so do I. But your minus a witch and I'm minus a spell book. So what do you say?
Damon: Stefan will come after you, you know that. For messing with Elena.
Anna: Then he won't be to happy if I kill her when I don't get what I want.
Damon: When do you want to do this?
Anna: God, it's like 1864 all over again. You Salvatores are truly pathetic when it comes to women. Tonight. After sundown. Meet at the church.
Ben: Witches don't have eternal life, right? So you guys can die.
Bonnie: Yep. We can die.
Ben: Ah. That sucks.
Elena: Stefan!
Stefan: Let's get outside!
Stefan: When the sun goes down, leave town. If I ever see you again, I will kill you.
Bonnie: How did you know where we were?
Grams: Many things can fuel a witches power. Worry. Anger. After Stefan told me they had taken you, I had a lot of both. Simple locater spell was easy after that.
Bonnie: I'm sorry. About all of this.
Grams: 
Elena: So what do we do now?
Stefan: Well, for now, you need to stay here.
Grams: A prisoner, in my own home? I don't think so.
Stefan: I can't protect you if you leave the house.
Grams: We'll protect ourselves.
Elena: We need to let him have Katherine back. He's not going to stop until he gets her. If we help him, maybe that ends it.
Bonnie: No! He doesn't deserve to get what he wants.
Elena: What other choice do we have?
Grams: Witches being pulled down by vampire problems. As much as we tried to do to stay out of it. I'll open the tomb. You get your brother's girl and destroy the rest with fire. Then this will be all over.
Stefan: We still have to get Damon to agree.
Elena: He already agreed once.
Stefan: Yeah, and then we double crossed him. So now he's angry.
Elena: He's hurt. There's a difference. I think I know what I have to do.
Anna: You've got to be kidding me.
Ben: It was Stefan. There was nothing I could --
Anna: Shut up! Stop talking. 
Damon: I'm gonna have to change the locks. You stage a jailbreak?
Elena: Stefan.
Damon: Ah, brother. Ever the white knight.
Elena: I convinced Bonnie to help you.
Damon: I doubt that.
Elena: I'm not gonna say that I'm sorry we got the grimoire without you last night, because I'm not really.
Damon: Well, at least you're honest.
Elena: I was protecting the people I love, Damon. But so were you, in your own, twisted way. And as hard as it is to figure, we're all on the same side, after the same thing.
Damon: Not interested.
Elena: Yes you are, because you were willing to work with us yesterday.
Damon: 
Elena: Okay, when we were in Atlanta, why didn't you use your compulsion on me?
Damon: Who's to say I didn't?
Elena: You didn't. I know you didn't. But you could have. You and I...we have something. An understanding. And I know that my betrayal hurt you, different from how it is with you and Stefan, but I'm promising you this now, I will help you get Katherine back.
Damon: 
Elena: Ask me if I'm lying now.
Damon: You know Anna won't stop, by the way, no matter what I do.
Elena: Then we'll deal with it.
Damon: I didn't compel you in Atlanta because we were having fun. I wanted it to be real. I'm trusting you. Don't make me regret it.
Elena: The Duke party. I forgot. I hope they stay clear of the church.
Damon: Your hope, not mine.
Matt: Elena, hey!
Caroline: Elena! Oh my God, where have you been?
Damon: Long story, no time to tell it.
Caroline: I wasn't talking to you.
Damon: Sure you were.
Matt: We haven't met. I'm Matt.
Damon: Matt, there's a reason we haven't met. You and I are going that way.
Elena: Ah, I'm sorry, guys.
Stefan: Cleared the debris away. Set the torches like you asked. We can get down now.
Bonnie: What is that?
Stefan: It's everything I need to destroy them.
Grams: Are you sure that Damon will come back with her?
Damon: Brother. Witches.
Stefan: Everything okay?
Elena: I just want to get this over with. Are we ready?
Bonnie: I guess so.
Tyler: Done!
Tyler: I'll be right back. 
Jeremy: Wait, you're kidding me, right? You act like a total dick every time we cross paths, and - and now you wanna party with me?
Tyler: Lighten up, Gilbert. I'm just asking you a question.
Jeremy: Look, I don't get you man.
Tyler: It's a party. You're a partyer. There's no need to psychoanalyze it.
Jeremy: I don't party anymore and even if I did, it wouldn't be with you.
Tyler: No problem. Carry on just standing there. By yourself. All alone. The enemy of fun. Do you even have any friends?
Jeremy: Thank God.
Anna: Weird hello but, okay. What's the matter?
Jeremy: Uh, nothing. Nothing, just....
Jeremy: It's- nothing.
Anna: Come on, let's walk.
Grams: Air. Earth. Fire.
Bonnie: Water.
Elena: That's it? Just water from the tap?
Grams: As opposed to what?
Elena: I just figured maybe it would have to be blessed or mystical or something.
Stefan: What's that?
Damon: It's for Katherine. Gotta have something to get her going. Unless your girl's offering a vein to tap. 
Stefan: 
Damon: Hmm.
Bonnie: We're ready.
Anna: This place is wild.
Jeremy: You kinda like dead people, huh?
Anna: I'm strange, remember? You okay?
Jeremy: Uh, yeah. Yeah. This place makes me think about someone.
Anna: A dead someone?
Jeremy: No, no, just...someone I used to know. So, uh, hey, 
Anna: 
Jeremy: I'm not really sure what my scene is anymore. So what do you say? You, uh, you wanna be part of my non-scene?
Anna: I would happily be a part of your non-scene, except, uh, I'm leaving.
Jeremy: Wait, what?
Anna: Yeah. My mom and I are moving away.
Jeremy: Oh. Uh- that's--that's a bummer.
Anna: Yeah?
Jeremy: Well, yeah.
Anna: So, guess this is goodbye.
Jeremy: I guess it is.
Jeremy: Anna, your face!
Anna: It's nothing.
Jeremy: It didn't look like nothing.
Anna: 
Ben: Yes, I did.
Anna: Grab him and lets go. I'm taking him to meet my mother.
Tyler: Swoop!
Matt: Hey!
Tyler: Aah. Where's your date?
Matt: Who knows?
Tyler: Aww, is the honeymoon over already?
Matt: Maybe.
Tyler: After all that grief you gave me about liking her. I figured it would have lasted longer than five minutes.
Matt: Look, I just -- I don't know if I can do the whole public couple thing. She -- she seems like she might be a little clingy.
Tyler: Well, good. I need my boy single anyway. 
Caroline: Hey! There you are.
Matt: Here I am.
Tyler: Yeah, well, I'm not drunk enough. So I'm just gonna go get another beer.
Caroline: So...
Matt: So.
Caroline: I have another speech.
Matt: Okay.
Caroline: The hand thing, with Elena, it was lame. Well, I was lame. And, hey, your feelings for Elena aside, Damon was there, and he was always such a jerk to me. And I wanted to show off that I was with a good guy. So, anyway, I was lame. So, forgiven?
Matt: Yeah, of course. Yeah.
Damon: What are they saying?
Stefan: Sounds Latin.
Elena: I don't think it's Latin.
Elena: What's happening?
Bonnie: It worked!
Grams: Of course it worked.
Damon: 
Stefan: 
Damon: You ready?
Elena: What?
Damon: 
Grams: Don't take her in. I'll bring the walls down.
Damon: You'll bring the walls down if I don't. You think I trust you?
Grams: As much as I trust you.
Elena: Enough. Both of you. Look, he needs leverage. He needs to know that you're not going to shut the door when he gets inside. I get it. I'll go.
Damon: May I?
Ben: Dark down there?
Stefan: Thought I told you to leave.
Ben: I considered it. Then I thought, screw you.
Anna: Hey, hero. 
Stefan: I can't let you do that.
Anna: Well, Ben's about to make a main course out of Elena's little brother. So, you can stop me or him. Your choice.
Elena: What is that?!
Damon: They can sense you. Now, where is she?
Elena: Damon!
Bonnie: Hey, you're not going in there!
Anna: You think you can stop me?
Grams: Bonnie...
Bonnie: Why did you let her go in?
Grams: Because she isn't coming out, baby. None of them are.
Stefan: Do you really think that she cares about you? Hm? You're disposable.
Ben: I don't care. She already gave me what I want.
Stefan: Are you going to say "eternal life"? You really that stupid?
Ben: You know, I've heard about you. You don't feed. You're not strong enough to beat me.
Ben: Is that all you got?
Stefan: No. I got this.
Elena: Damon? 
Stefan: Where's Elena?
Bonnie: Damon took her inside.
Stefan: What?!
Grams: Stefan! If you go in there, you won't come out.
Stefan: What did you do?
Grams: Opening the door didn't remove the seal, it just opened the door.
Stefan: What's the seal?
Grams: Some seals keep vampires from entering. This one keeps them from coming out.
Stefan: Elena's human. She can leave. Anna and Katherine can't. Damon can't. You were never planning on breaking the spell, were you?
Grams: I told you. I will protect my own. Elena can get out. That's all that matters.
Anna: You must have a taste for it. You scream and shriek and even bother to escape, but then you just come right back to it.
Anna: Mother! Mother. Your boyfriend did this, you know.
Elena: His father did.
Anna: And Johnathan Gilbert. I made a choice a long time ago that it would be Gilbert blood that brought her back to life. I had Jeremy all ready to go but....
Bonnie: Stefan! 
Grams: He made his choice!
Bonnie: No. Here. 
Grams: We are not strong enough. Even if we were able to bring the seal down, there's no guarantee that we could get it back up again.
Bonnie: You said it yourself, many things can fuel a witches power. Help me or I'll do it alone.
Elena: No, please don't!
Anna: 
Stefan: Let her go!
Anna: No!
Stefan: Go. Go. I'm right behind you.
Pearl: Anna.
Pearl: Annabelle.
Bonnie: Elena, Stefan...
Elena: He's right behind me.
Elena: Stefan, what are you doing?
Bonnie: It's gonna be okay. We'll fix it.
Elena: What is it?
Stefan: I can't.
Elena: Can't? Can't what?
Bonnie: The spell's still up. We can't get them out yet.
Elena: You went in there not knowing if you could come back out?
Elena: Oh, my God.
Stefan: I heard you scream.
Elena: We can't leave him in there. We promised him. Both of us.
Stefan: I know.
Grams: Even if we're able to break through the seal, we won't be able to hold it for long.
Damon: She's not here.
Stefan: Damon.
Damon: She's not here.
Stefan: What?
Damon: She's not here!
Elena: I think it's working.
Anna: I just wanted my mother back. Jeremy's fine. He's outside. I won't touch him.
Grams: Bonnie, keep going! 
Elena: Stefan, they can't hold it much longer!
Stefan: Damon, we need to get out of here.
Damon: It doesn't make sense. They locked her inside.
Stefan: If we don't leave now, we're not getting out.
Damon: How could she not be in here?
Stefan: It's not worth spending all of eternity down here. She's not worth it!
Damon: No!
Elena: Damon! Please.
Bonnie: Oh my God. I can't!
Grams: Yes, you can.
Matt: Is this for real?
Caroline: Is what for real?
Matt: You being all cool and honest and open?
Caroline: Speech number three? I want this to work. And I'm scared that you're gonna change your mind and you're not gonna want it. I don't want to mess it up.
Matt: I don't want to mess it up either.
Stefan: He's okay.
Stefan: He's all right.
Elena: I'm sorry.
Bonnie: Hey, let me help you.
Grams: Oh, I'm fine. You don't need to coddle me, baby.
Bonnie: It was a big spell, Grams. I could tell it took a lot out of you.
Grams: I'll be fine.
Elena: How's your head?
Jeremy: Uh- it's alright. I just....I wish I knew how I passed out. I didn't drink that much, I swear.
Elena: And you don't remember anything?
Jeremy: The whole things pretty cloudy. I just...I know how this looks. I'm -- I'm sorry.
Elena: No, Jeremy, don't be sorry. You didn't do anything, okay?
Jeremy: Yeah, okay.
Elena: I've got to head on over to Bonnie's for a little bit, but is there anything that you need?
Jeremy: No, I'm just...I'm gonna crash.
Elena: Okay, well, Jenna's here and I'll be back soon.
Damon: You knew Katherine wasn't in there.
Anna: You wouldn't have helped me.
Anna: No! No!
Damon: Why do you get a happy ending?
Anna: Damon, please! You wouldn't have helped me, you know you wouldn't have!
Damon: Why do you get it and I don't?
Pearl: The guard. The one at the church. The one who locked us in. She promised to turn him. He was obsessed with her. She had him under her spell, like everybody else. He let her go.
Anna: Last I saw her was Chicago, 1983. She knew where you were Damon. She didn't care.
Anna: Sorry.
Elena: I just got to Bonnie's.
Stefan: Everything alright?
Elena: Yeah. How's Damon? Is he gonna be okay?
Stefan: I don't know. Can I call you later?
Elena: Yeah, of course.
Bonnie: Here you go, Grams.
Bonnie: Grams?
Bonnie: Grams! Grams, wake up! Grams! Grams! 
Bonnie: Help! Wake up! She's not breathing! She's just not breathing! Please, wake up!
Bonnie: I'm gonna fix it! It's okay, I can fix this!
Elena: Yes, I need an ambulance to Oak Street. It's an emergency, quick.
Elena: Bonnie....Bonnie.
Bonnie: No! No! I can fix it! Grams, I can fix this!
Elena: Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie.
