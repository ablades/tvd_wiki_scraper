STEFAN: Damon, wake up! I need you! Wake up!
STEFAN: Damon, wake the hell up!
CAROLINE: 
PATRONS: Drinken! Drinken! Drinken!
PATRONS: Yeah! Hahaha! Woo!
CAROLINE: 
BONNIE: Drinken. Now.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Whatcha writing?
CAROLINE: Stefan! What are you doing here?
STEFAN: Matt reported some blood bags missing from the hospital, so I thought I'd check it out.
CAROLINE: Do you think it's your mom?
STEFAN: If it's not, then she has quite literally dropped off the face of the earth, and I'm still deciding if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
CAROLINE: So... how's Damon?
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: I made this, uh, a thing, didn't I?
CAROLINE: You made what a thing?
STEFAN: I told you how I felt about you, and now it's- it's weird.
CAROLINE: No. It's not weird, Stefan...
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: ...Obviously... you know... scrambling to fill the awkward silence.
CAROLINE: Okay, you made it a thing. Congratulations.
STEFAN: Alright, how about this? New rule-- you live your life, you heal, and in the meantime, we're friends.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Good. Okay, happy writing!
CAROLINE: Thank you.
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: 
clear: the food is literally made of poison, the air smells like a plague, and everyone wants to know what everyone else is doing.
read: "Please let me know when you have the blood. Thank you." "Valerie? You haven't checked in. Please call." "You're missing breakfast. Where are you?"
VALERIE: 
GIRLFRIEND: Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! What did you do?
STU: I didn't think she'd walk right into the street.
GIRLFRIEND: 
STU: 
STU: Okay. It's not like anyone saw us, right?
GIRLFRIEND: 
STU: 
STU: Let's go.
VALERIE: 
MALCOLM: None for me, Lily. I've already had my ration today.
VALERIE: 
NORA: What a saint you are, Malcolm.
NORA: This is ludicrous.
LOUISE: Nora's right. How long are we to live on three sips a day? It's that prison world all over again.
LILY: Beau's not complaining.
LOUISE: Beau's mute.
MALCOLM: And here I thought we could have a family meal in peace! Beau, care to join me for a game of backgammon while the lovebirds bicker?
ALARIC: I can't... feel my cheeks. What are we drinking?
DAMON: No idea.
DAMON: Can you read German?
ALARIC: That's, uh, actually Dutch.
DAMON: 
BONNIE: Amsterdam.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: Is that really necessary?
BONNIE: Elena told me to keep a journal of everything she's missing! When she wakes up in sixty-odd years and finds out that Ric died from alcohol poisoning, she's gonna want to know what happened.
DAMON: 
BONNIE: Aw, so sweet.
BONNIE: I'm gonna go rent a bike and see the city like a normal tourist.
DAMON: 
BONNIE: 
DAMON: Hey! Ride in the tram tracks, don't look both ways...
BONNIE: 
ALARIC: Are you sure you don't want to go with her?
DAMON: 
ALARIC: I don't need a babysitter, Damon.
DAMON: This isn't about what you need, Ric. It's about what I need. Just keeping you from jumping off a cliff keeps my mind off of the fact that my girlfriend's magical coma is linked to a Bennett witch that has a knack for avoiding permanent death.
ALARIC: 
DAMON: Yup.
ALARIC: Okay.
DAMON: What?
ALARIC: 
LILY: I am headed to New York this afternoon to meet up with Lorenzo. I assume I have nothing to worry about?
NORA: So, you're allowed to explore the world while we're stuck here, starving ourselves, pretending like we're not the strongest people on the planet?
LILY: Need I remind you how things used to be?
LOUISE: You mean when you loved us and allowed us to have actual fun?
LILY: 
LOUISE: Now you want us to coexist? We know. We heard your speech.
NORA: What about Oscar? He's been gone days running your errands. I highly doubt he's off living in secret.
LILY: Valerie, you're a mess! What happened?
VALERIE: 
NORA: Oh, dear! Is their automobile okay?
VALERIE: The little monsters left me for dead! No apology, no call for help. I was roadkill, and what did I do? I acted like roadkill, because we're governed by a pacifist who'd rather see her children hurt than stand up for themselves.
NORA: Valerie, don't cry. Okay? You're home now. You're with us.
LOUISE: Yeah. Who needs the rest of the world, right? We have each other.
LILY: You resisted your urge to fight back. That means you're learning. I'm proud of you, Valerie.
VALERIE: Missed a spot.
GIRLFRIEND: 
LOUISE: Remember that large squirrel you ran over this morning? Turns out, that was actually our friend, Valerie.
GIRLFRIEND: 
VALERIE: 
NORA: 
LOUISE: 
LOUISE: You're worse than your friend-- you thought about doing the right thing, but then you just left her there.
VALERIE: And yet, you're the first thing in this town that I don't entirely hate.
VALERIE: 
NORA: Lily needs to learn that Heretics aren't designed to coexist.
VALERIE: Really? Be more vain.
NORA: Well, if you were pretty, you'd be, too.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Listen, these bodies? They're not Lily's style. It's got to be the Heretics.
DAMON: 
DAMON: 
MATT: One victim had bite wounds, and the other one was scorched beyond recognition.
STEFAN: Matt found a house that's been in foreclosure for the last two years, and it had its power mysteriously turned back on just days after Ric's wedding, so Caroline is there staking it out.
STEFAN: Listen, I need Ric to tell me how to make a bomb.
DAMON: Oh, it's for you.
ALARIC: Hello?
DAMON: 
ALARIC: Hello?
STEFAN: Alaric? I need you to teach me how to make a bomb...
ALARIC: Okay. Great. Well, the party's over.
STEFAN: I am literally staring at a treasure trove full of your, uh, fancy little weapons.
ALARIC: Yeah, exactly! Now, go use one.
STEFAN: Uh, it's not that easy. I mean, if we want to take them out, we have to do it all at once.
ALARIC: Alright. Well, I'm gonna have to call you back from a less populated place, and then I'm gonna blissfully pass out and pretend that this never happened.
ALARIC: Whoa. Okay.
BONNIE: Lily won. As much as we did everything to stop her, she actually got her family back.
DAMON: If Stefan says he's got it, he's got it.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: 
BONNIE: Listen to yourself, Damon. Elena wants you to live your life!
DAMON: 
BONNIE: What's that supposed to mean?
DAMON: 
DAMON: Ugh, I've had some janky-ass bourbon in my time, but this is...
BONNIE: It's not bourbon. It's tea.
ALARIC: Have you ever seen this stone before?
PSYCHIC: 
ALARIC: That's not important.
ALARIC: Can you commune with my wife and tell her that I have it?
PSYCHIC: I can try. But, of course, I will need a mystical tether to access her spirit. Something of significance.
ALARIC: This is her wedding ring.
PSYCHIC: I just had a very powerful feeling. There's a lot of energy in this ring. You two shared a strong bond. She loved you unconditionally. She wants you to know that she misses you--
ALARIC: Do you get off on this? Preying on the hope and misery of people?
ALARIC: 
PSYCHIC: 
ENZO: It's a crime for the prettiest girl in the bar to sit alone.
ENZO: Two of your finest scotch, please, darling.
LILY: Lorenzo, how I've missed you!
ENZO: 
LILY: 
ENZO: 
ENZO: Well, in the meantime, you've summoned me to New York. My interest is piqued.
LILY: I was hoping you might find something for me.
LILY: During my captivity, a very dear possession I thought was lost when our ship from England was torched was found by divers. It's been on display in the city's maritime museum, but it's recently disappeared again.
ENZO: 
LILY: 
ENZO: 
LILY: It's a family matter, Lorenzo.
ENZO: 
LILY: Darling, we want nothing more than to believe you're on our side!
ENZO: 
LILY: So, you're willing to see my sons for the monsters they are? To turn your back on your friendships?
LILY: What happened to that sick boy I met on the boat? The boy abandoned at the workhouse at the age of four? The boy who never knew kindness until the day I saved his life?
ENZO: That boy is not your errand boy.
ENZO: Find your own damn rock.
CAROLINE: There's five Heretics-- two guys, three girls. And, your mom isn't home.
STEFAN: Enzo?
CAROLINE: He's not there either. So, if we're going to do this, now is our window.
STEFAN: Whoa, whoa!
CAROLINE: Show me how this works.
STEFAN: First of all, this is a bomb.
STEFAN: That there is the timer.
CAROLINE: Mmhmm.
STEFAN: I'm gonna set it for sixty seconds.
CAROLINE: Sixty seconds. Got it.
STEFAN: Are you sure that you want to do this?
CAROLINE: I have to do this. They lived in your house for a hundred years. They've seen your picture. They'll recognize you immediately.
STEFAN: I'm just saying... If you think this is a crazy plan, now's the time to speak up.
CAROLINE: Is there any version of this plan where you're not worried about me?
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: 
NORA: We're not interested.
CAROLINE: Oh. Oh, no! Don't worry, I'm not selling anything. I'm your neighbor from down the block!
NORA: 
CAROLINE: Wow! Great place. Love what you've done with the floors. Is this the original hardwood?
VALERIE: 
CAROLINE: 
NORA: 
CAROLINE: I'm just gonna put this right over here. Then...
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: Clumsy.
CAROLINE: So, where are you guys from?
NORA: I do love that jacket.
CAROLINE: 
NORA: Don't you just love what she's wearing?
LOUISE: It's fine, though it would look entirely better on you.
MATT: Hey, Caroline-- we should really get going to that barbeque.
LOUISE: 
MATT: 
MATT: Care, we should really go.
NORA: "Care" isn't leaving yet.
NORA: 
CAROLINE: Here! Take my jacket.
NORA: 
CAROLINE: See you!
LOUISE: Wait.
LOUISE: 
CAROLINE: It looks amazing on you!
VALERIE: Does anyone else smell that?
BONNIE: Ric was right here! How did we lose him?
DAMON: You're wearing terrible shoes for trailing someone, your eyes suck, and you're slow.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: 
BONNIE: So, where do you wanna go?
BONNIE: Should we turn around, or should we go straight? Or make a left here...?
BONNIE: Wow. Thank you!
DAMON: 
BONNIE: Hang on-- did you see that truck coming?
DAMON: 
BONNIE: 
DAMON: 
BONNIE: Three seconds? I could have died!
DAMON: 
BONNIE: 
DAMON: How else am I supposed to feel, Bonnie? Every time I look at you, all I see is not Elena.
BONNIE: 
LILY: To what do I owe this rare pleasure?
STEFAN: I hope you weren't too attached to that house. We blew it into a pile of ash with your family inside.
LILY: 
STEFAN: They're gone, Lily. And you have until tonight to get out of Mystic Falls, or we come after you next.
LILY: 
LILY: My son, if I may offer you some motherly advice? Run.
SHERIFF: Please join me in recognizing our graduating class of new deputies as I read their names and they receive their badges.
NORA: 
LOUISE: 
NORA: 
LOUISE: 
SHERIFF: Deputy Cornell Willis...
NORA: Mar... It's the 21st century. We can hold hands now.
VALERIE: Oh my God! Is this your first date in public? That's adorable.
VALERIE: Can we focus on revenge, please?
SHERIFF: Deputy Taylor Hall...
VALERIE: 
SHERIFF: Deputy Matthew Donovan...
VALERIE: 
SHERIFF: Deputy Tim Johnson...
VALERIE: 
SHERIFF: Deputy Jeffrey Morrison...
VALERIE: 
SHERIFF: Deputy Don Morris...
STEFAN: Hey, I think we have a problem.
VALERIE: 
SHERIFF: Sorry for the malfunction, folks.
VALERIE: 
GRADUATE: AHHHHHH!
MATT: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: 
NORA: Hello, neighbor.
STEFAN: Ugh! Ugh!
LILY: 
LILY: I fought tirelessly to reunite us, found ways to coexist in this new world, sacrificed everything to make us a family again! How dare you jeopardize that? All of you...
LILY: The bloodshed ends now.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: I thought we blew them up! How did they survive that?
STEFAN: I have no idea.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: God, what are you looking at?
STEFAN: There's a splinter embedded in my neck, and I can't seem to get it out...
CAROLINE: Come here.
STEFAN: Thank you.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: It's just, there's history here, you know? This town, and this house, these people... and I just don't see a world where Mystic Falls survives a war between us and them. And if Lily thinks she can control five Heretics, she's insane.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
MATT: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: 
MATT: 
CAROLINE: 
LILY: 
MATT: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
ENZO: 
CAROLINE: 
ENZO: 
CAROLINE: 
ENZO: 
CAROLINE: Yeah!
ENZO: No, don't clump me in with Lily's circus freaks.
CAROLINE: Well, then where should I clump you? One day, you're helping Lily, the next you're here being nice. Just pick a side, Enzo. Us or them.
ENZO: 
CAROLINE: That's because she doesn't trust you. And honestly? Neither do I.
STEFAN: How's Europe?
DAMON: 
DAMON: Anything I should know about?
STEFAN: Eh, it can wait 'til you get back.
DAMON: Well, I'm back! Want to tell me who the hell's living in our house?
STEFAN: The whole town would have been slaughtered.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: We already tried that.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Look, what's done is done. Do not mess this up.
DAMON: Who convinced you to save a town full of people you don't give a crap about? Because it's not your idea, and Matt can't think his way out of a paper bag, so it must be Caroline's.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: You know, Elena wanted you to be happy. To live. Even encouraged you to date. But, if she wakes up and everyone she loves is dead, do you think she's going to be able to forgive that?
STEFAN: I'm not doing this for Caroline, Damon. I'm doing this for you.
BONNIE: 
MATT: Bonnie, hey!
MATT: I didn't know you were back.
BONNIE: I honestly don't know where I am.
BONNIE: Matt, surrendering the town is not the solution. We need to stop them.
MATT: They had been stopped, Bon, back in 1903. But then, you betrayed Kai, he let them out, and I got to bury all my buddies from the Sheriff's department.
BONNIE: So this is my fault?
MATT: 
MATT: Look, I gotta go patrol.
BONNIE: What are you doing here?
DAMON: 
BONNIE: 
DAMON: 
BONNIE: 
DAMON: The first second, I thought of how amazing it would feel to have Elena in my arms again. By second number two, I was kissing her...
DAMON: And by the third, I remember you're my best friend, and that if anything ever happened to you, I would lose my mind. So, yes, Bonnie, I do know how long three seconds are.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: And I will wait for her, and you're gonna help me. You're stuck with me, too.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: No, Bonnie-- the Heretics are out because my mother's a lunatic and everyone's too scared to stop her.
BONNIE: 
MALCOLM: Trespassers are free-reign, friend.
MALCOLM: And you are...?
BONNIE: 
MALCOLM: To be fair, you are nothing if I take your magic.
CAROLINE: Are we making a huge mistake handing over our hometown to a bunch of supernatural terrorists?
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Well, what would Sheriff Forbes do?
CAROLINE: She would protect human life at any cost.
STEFAN: Well, then, no. I don't think we're making a mistake.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: Heh. I'm gonna go, uh, board up the front door.
CAROLINE: Hey, Stefan?
CAROLINE: I'm happy. You make me happy.
CAROLINE: Uh... uh, my best friend's gone, my mom's dead... Uh, the whole town is destroyed... But, when I'm with you, I'm happy. And yeah, you're right. I just need to...
ASSISTANT: 
ALARIC: 
ASSISTANT: 
ALARIC: A policy you were willing to break last month.
ALARIC: Now, I say we keep breaking it.
ASSISTANT: 
ALARIC: Well, I'm not planning on burying her. I'm planning on bringing her back to life.
ALARIC: It's a morgue. It's called gallows humor. Now, can I see her, please?
VALERIE: 
LOUISE: Valerie! Beau!
NORA: It's Malcolm!
LOUISE: Help! He's dead!
VALERIE: 
LOUISE: We found him in town. He was just lying there.
NORA: 
LILY: Malcolm?
LILY: 
LILY: 
LILY: 
CAROLINE: 
ENZO: What is it with everyone's incessant need to write down every single feeling?
CAROLINE: 
ENZO: 
CAROLINE: 
ENZO: 
CAROLINE: 
ENZO: 
ENZO: Yeah, someone killed Malcolm. I believe he was her eldest.
CAROLINE: 
ENZO: 
CAROLINE: 
ENZO: I reckon it goes without saying I chose Lily.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: I guess she upped her game.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Come on. Ugh!
