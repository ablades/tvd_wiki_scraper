I'm Thinking Of You All The While
Never Let Me Go







Contents

FLASH-FORWARD-- BROOKLYN, NEW YORK, 2016



STEFAN: Damon, wake up! I need you! Wake up!




STEFAN: Damon, wake the hell up!



TITLE CARD & OPENING CREDITS

PRESENT DAY (2013)-- OPENING MONTAGE



CAROLINE: 
 Dear Elena... A few weeks ago, you said goodbye and told us to write everything down so you'd feel like you didn't miss anything when you woke up. Bad news first-- Damon said the best way to keep his mind off you was to help Alaric grieve. So, in common Damon-fashion, he kidnapped Ric and flew him to Europe for a guy-getaway. I'm sure you can imagine how that's going.




BAR PATRONS: Drinken! Drinken! Drinken!




BAR PATRONS: Yeah! Hahaha! Woo!

CAROLINE: 
 Obviously, we didn't send them there without a chaperone.





BONNIE: Drinken. Now.

CAROLINE: 
 So, Damon's watching out for Alaric, Bonnie's watching out for Damon, and I don't know exactly who's watching out for Bonnie.





CAROLINE: 
 Matt will officially be Deputy Donovan next week when he graduates. As happy as I am for him, a big part of me wishes my mom was hear to see it.





CAROLINE: 
 The Town Council gave her a bench. I've been visiting it, hoping I'll miraculously start missing her less. 
 I keep thinking that if I can heal, I can move on with my life, but I don't see that happening any time soon.





CAROLINE: 
 Anyway, I covered Damon, Bonnie, Ric, Matt... Who am I missing?





STEFAN: Whatcha writing?

CAROLINE: Stefan! What are you doing here?

STEFAN: Matt reported some blood bags missing from the hospital, so I thought I'd check it out.

CAROLINE: Do you think it's your mom?

STEFAN: If it's not, then she has quite literally dropped off the face of the earth, and I'm still deciding if that's a good thing or a bad thing.




CAROLINE: So... how's Damon?

STEFAN: 
 Well, if the last time he sat around waiting decades for a girl taught us anything, then I am worried.

CAROLINE: 
 Well, if you're worried, then I'm terrified.




STEFAN: I made this, uh, a thing, didn't I?




CAROLINE: You made what a thing?

STEFAN: I told you how I felt about you, and now it's- it's weird.

CAROLINE: No. It's not weird, Stefan...

STEFAN: 
 You just asked about my brother-- who you hate-- to fill awkward silence.

CAROLINE: 
 I don't hate Damon! I'm just...




CAROLINE: ...Obviously... you know... scrambling to fill the awkward silence.




CAROLINE: Okay, you made it a thing. Congratulations.

STEFAN: Alright, how about this? New rule-- you live your life, you heal, and in the meantime, we're friends.

CAROLINE: 
 I like that rule!

STEFAN: Good. Okay, happy writing!

CAROLINE: Thank you.




CAROLINE: 
 As I was saying... things are great.





VALERIE: 
 Dear diary-- I'm in hell. It's hard to imagine a place worse than where I've come from, but by some spectacular miracle, I found it. In the weeks since I've arrived, three things are clear: the food is literally made of poison, the air smells like a plague, and everyone wants to know what everyone else is doing.


[As Valerie walks down the street, she tries her best to reply to text messages she's received from Lily on her phone, but she can't seem to get it to work, and taps the screen multiple times in frustration as she crosses the street. The messages she's received read: "Please let me know when you have the blood. Thank you." "Valerie? You haven't checked in. Please call." "You're missing breakfast. Where are you?"

VALERIE: 
 I don't. I don't fit in here, nor do I want to. This is not the world I imagined.





STU'S GIRLFRIEND: Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! What did you do?

STU: I didn't think she'd walk right into the street.

STU'S GIRLFRIEND: 
 Stu. Stu, we have to call 911.

STU: 
 Shut up, okay? Let me think.




STU: Okay. It's not like anyone saw us, right?

STU'S GIRLFRIEND: 
 Are you insane? We can't just leave her here. She's not moving!

STU: 
 We just smoked a joint, okay? I'm high as a freaking kite right now. Do you want me to go to jail?




STU: Let's go.




VALERIE: 
 As I was saying-- complete and utter hell. Not that my family's making it any easier.





VALERIE 
 Lily's sequestered us away in some musty abandoned house. Stoic Beau; Nora the brat; the devious, mental Mary Louise; and Malcolm, Lily's pet--





MALCOLM: None for me, Lily. I've already had my ration today.

VALERIE: 
 -- The brown-noser.





NORA: What a saint you are, Malcolm.




NORA: This is ludicrous.

MARY LOUISE: Nora's right. How long are we to live on three sips a day? It's that prison world all over again.

LILY: Beau's not complaining.

MARY LOUISE: Beau's mute.




MALCOLM: And here I thought we could have a family meal in peace! Beau, care to join me for a game of backgammon while the lovebirds bicker?




AMSTERDAM BAR



ALARIC: I can't... feel my cheeks. What are we drinking?

DAMON: No idea.




DAMON: Can you read German?

ALARIC: That's, uh, actually Dutch.

DAMON: 
 Wait, where are we?




BONNIE: Amsterdam.




BONNIE: 
 Dear Elena... Yup, halfway across Europe, and they're still drunk.





DAMON: Is that really necessary?




BONNIE: Elena told me to keep a journal of everything she's missing! When she wakes up in sixty-odd years and finds out that Ric died from alcohol poisoning, she's gonna want to know what happened.

DAMON: 
 Unless you tragically choke to death on those cocktail peanuts. Then I can tell her myself.




BONNIE: Aw, so sweet.




BONNIE: I'm gonna go rent a bike and see the city like a normal tourist.

DAMON: 
 FYI, they don't wear helmets here.

BONNIE: 
 Keeps getting funnier.




DAMON: Hey! Ride in the tram tracks, don't look both ways...

BONNIE: 
 Got it.




ALARIC: Are you sure you don't want to go with her?

DAMON: 
 Nice try. I'm not leaving you.

ALARIC: I don't need a babysitter, Damon.

DAMON: This isn't about what you need, Ric. It's about what I need. Just keeping you from jumping off a cliff keeps my mind off of the fact that my girlfriend's magical coma is linked to a Bennett witch that has a knack for avoiding permanent death.

ALARIC: 
 I see. So, my misery is merely a convenient distraction for you?

DAMON: Yup.

ALARIC: Okay.




DAMON: What?

ALARIC: 
 I'm glad you're here, buddy.

FORECLOSED HOUSE, MYSTIC FALLS



LILY: I am headed to New York this afternoon to meet up with Lorenzo. I assume I have nothing to worry about?

NORA: So, you're allowed to explore the world while we're stuck here, starving ourselves, pretending like we're not the strongest people on the planet?

LILY: Need I remind you how things used to be?

MARY LOUISE: You mean when you loved us and allowed us to have actual fun?

LILY: 
 Our appetite for murder drew unwanted attention, forced us to run for decades at a time, and then got us imprisoned for one hundred years. Our way of living did not work, Mary Louise.

MARY LOUISE: Now you want us to coexist? We know. We heard your speech.

NORA: What about Oscar? He's been gone days running your errands. I highly doubt he's off living in secret.




LILY: Valerie, you're a mess! What happened?

VALERIE: 
 Some horrible teenagers plowed me down in their automobile.

NORA: Oh, dear! Is their automobile okay?




VALERIE: The little monsters left me for dead! No apology, no call for help. I was roadkill, and what did I do? I acted like roadkill, because we're governed by a pacifist who'd rather see her children hurt than stand up for themselves.




NORA: Valerie, don't cry. Okay? You're home now. You're with us.

MARY LOUISE: Yeah. Who needs the rest of the world, right? We have each other.




LILY: You resisted your urge to fight back. That means you're learning. I'm proud of you, Valerie.




MYSTIC FALLS HIGH SCHOOL



VALERIE: Missed a spot.




STU'S GIRLFRIEND: 
 Who are you?

MARY LOUISE: Remember that large squirrel you ran over this morning? Turns out, that was actually our friend, Valerie.




STU'S GIRLFRIEND: 
 But... you looked dead.

VALERIE: 
 I get that a lot.




NORA: 
 Phesmatos motus!




MARY LOUISE: 
 Vido!




MARY LOUISE: You're worse than your friend-- you thought about doing the right thing, but then you just left her there.




VALERIE: And yet, you're the first thing in this town that I don't entirely hate.




VALERIE: 
 Lily will be furious.

NORA: Lily needs to learn that Heretics aren't designed to coexist.




VALERIE: Really? Be more vain.

NORA: Well, if you were pretty, you'd be, too.






SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE / AMSTERDAM BAR



DAMON: 
 What the hell happened?

STEFAN: Listen, these bodies? They're not Lily's style. It's got to be the Heretics.

DAMON: 
 Reception went a little fuzzy, brother. It sounds like you said Mom got her family of crazies back.




DAMON: 
 Can I have some details?




MATT: One victim had bite wounds, and the other one was scorched beyond recognition.

STEFAN: Matt found a house that's been in foreclosure for the last two years, and it had its power mysteriously turned back on just days after Ric's wedding, so Caroline is there staking it out.




STEFAN: Listen, I need Ric to tell me how to make a bomb.




DAMON: Oh, it's for you.




ALARIC: Hello?

DAMON: 
 Other side.




ALARIC: Hello?

STEFAN: Alaric? I need you to teach me how to make a bomb...




ALARIC: Okay. Great. Well, the party's over.




STEFAN: I am literally staring at a treasure trove full of your, uh, fancy little weapons.

ALARIC: Yeah, exactly! Now, go use one.

STEFAN: Uh, it's not that easy. I mean, if we want to take them out, we have to do it all at once.




ALARIC: Alright. Well, I'm gonna have to call you back from a less populated place, and then I'm gonna blissfully pass out and pretend that this never happened.




ALARIC: Whoa. Okay.




BONNIE: Lily won. As much as we did everything to stop her, she actually got her family back.

DAMON: If Stefan says he's got it, he's got it.

BONNIE: 
 Do you really believe that, or is that just some excuse to continue your slow crawl towards rock-bottom?

DAMON: 
 Do you know how many days need to tick by before I see Elena again? 22,916 days, and that's assuming you get some old person's disease.




BONNIE: Listen to yourself, Damon. Elena wants you to live your life!

DAMON: 
 Bon, if you're gonna be here, you don't get to play the "What Would Elena Do" game.




BONNIE: What's that supposed to mean?

DAMON: 
 Nothing.




DAMON: Ugh, I've had some janky-ass bourbon in my time, but this is...




BONNIE: It's not bourbon. It's tea.

AMSTERDAM PSYCHIC'S OFFICE



ALARIC: Have you ever seen this stone before?

PSYCHIC: 
 Can't say that I have. What is it?




ALARIC: That's not important.




ALARIC: Can you commune with my wife and tell her that I have it?

PSYCHIC: I can try. But, of course, I will need a mystical tether to access her spirit. Something of significance.




ALARIC: This is her wedding ring.




PSYCHIC: I just had a very powerful feeling. There's a lot of energy in this ring. You two shared a strong bond. She loved you unconditionally. She wants you to know that she misses you--




ALARIC: Do you get off on this? Preying on the hope and misery of people?




ALARIC: 
 The ring is a fake, you dick! Lost the real one to the first psychic I saw.

PSYCHIC: 
 Maybe your wife's better off dead...




NEW YORK BAR



ENZO: It's a crime for the prettiest girl in the bar to sit alone.




ENZO: Two of your finest scotch, please, darling.




LILY: Lorenzo, how I've missed you!

ENZO: 
 And who's fault is that? Keeping me away while you toilet-train your new batch of orphaned puppies...

LILY: 
 They're learning moderation so they can live under the radar. You being there, living freely...

ENZO: 
 Yeah, bad influence, blah blah blah. Got it.




ENZO: Well, in the meantime, you've summoned me to New York. My interest is piqued.

LILY: I was hoping you might find something for me.




LILY: During my captivity, a very dear possession I thought was lost when our ship from England was torched was found by divers. It's been on display in the city's maritime museum, but it's recently disappeared again.

ENZO: 
 Why do you want it?




LILY: 
 If anyone discovered you were looking for it, you might be in danger.

ENZO: 
 All the more reason I should know why I'm looking for it.




LILY: It's a family matter, Lorenzo.




ENZO: 
 I thought I was your family.

LILY: Darling, we want nothing more than to believe you're on our side!

ENZO: 
 Your side? I stood by you when your own sons abandoned you.

LILY: So, you're willing to see my sons for the monsters they are? To turn your back on your friendships?




LILY: What happened to that sick boy I met on the boat? The boy abandoned at the workhouse at the age of four? The boy who never knew kindness until the day I saved his life?




ENZO: That boy is not your errand boy.




ENZO: Find your own damn rock.




SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



CAROLINE: There's five Heretics-- two guys, three girls. And, your mom isn't home.




STEFAN: Enzo?

CAROLINE: He's not there either. So, if we're going to do this, now is our window.




STEFAN: Whoa, whoa!

CAROLINE: Show me how this works.




STEFAN: First of all, this is a bomb.




STEFAN: That there is the timer.

CAROLINE: Mmhmm.

STEFAN: I'm gonna set it for sixty seconds.




CAROLINE: Sixty seconds. Got it.




STEFAN: Are you sure that you want to do this?

CAROLINE: I have to do this. They lived in your house for a hundred years. They've seen your picture. They'll recognize you immediately.

STEFAN: I'm just saying... If you think this is a crazy plan, now's the time to speak up.




CAROLINE: Is there any version of this plan where you're not worried about me?

STEFAN: 
 ...Probably not.

CAROLINE: 
 Mmhmm.




FORECLOSED HOUSE



CAROLINE: 
 Welcome to Mystic Falls! I'm Caroline.




NORA: We're not interested.




CAROLINE: Oh. Oh, no! Don't worry, I'm not selling anything. I'm your neighbor from down the block!

NORA: 
 So?




CAROLINE: Wow! Great place. Love what you've done with the floors. Is this the original hardwood?




VALERIE: 
 It's a gargantuan hell-hole. No one gives a damn about the floors.

[Malcolm, cups of blood in hand, comes into the living room as well and joins them.

CAROLINE: 
 Well, I brought you guys a housewarming gift. Mystic Falls tradition.

NORA: 
 Valerie's allergic to nature.




CAROLINE: I'm just gonna put this right over here. Then...




CAROLINE: 
 I am so sorry!




CAROLINE: Clumsy.




CAROLINE: So, where are you guys from?




NORA: I do love that jacket.

CAROLINE: 
 Thanks! I got it for my birth--




NORA: Don't you just love what she's wearing?

MARY LOUISE: It's fine, though it would look entirely better on you.




MATT: Hey, Caroline-- we should really get going to that barbeque.

MARY LOUISE: 
 And you would be...?

MATT: 
 Her ride.




MATT: Care, we should really go.

NORA: "Care" isn't leaving yet.




NORA: 
 Give me your jacket.




CAROLINE: Here! Take my jacket.

NORA: 
 Thank you. How sweet you are!




CAROLINE: See you!




MARY LOUISE: Wait.




MARY LOUISE: 
 You forgot to tell her how good she looks.




CAROLINE: It looks amazing on you!




VALERIE: Does anyone else smell that?




STREETS OF AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS



BONNIE: Ric was right here! How did we lose him?

DAMON: You're wearing terrible shoes for trailing someone, your eyes suck, and you're slow.




BONNIE: 
 Oh, I'm slow? You just spent the last few weeks in Europe with a guy pretending to be drunk, and you didn't even notice!

DAMON: 
 True.

BONNIE: So, where do you wanna go?




BONNIE: Should we turn around, or should we go straight? Or make a left here...?




BONNIE: Wow. Thank you!

DAMON: 
 Yeah. Of course.




BONNIE: Hang on-- did you see that truck coming?




DAMON: 
 What?

BONNIE: 
 Did you just hesitate to save my life?

DAMON: 
 Relax, it was three seconds.

BONNIE: Three seconds? I could have died!

DAMON: 
 You're right, Bon. Had I done nothing, Elena would be here, and it would all be grand.

BONNIE: 
 Enough! I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life thinking that you resent me.

DAMON: How else am I supposed to feel, Bonnie? Every time I look at you, all I see is not Elena.

BONNIE: 
 I'm so sorry this happened, but I lost Elena too, Damon. And you're one of the few reminders I have to hold onto, so you can resent me or love me... but you're stuck with me.




SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



LILY: To what do I owe this rare pleasure?

STEFAN: I hope you weren't too attached to that house. We blew it into a pile of ash with your family inside.

LILY: 
 I'm sorry, you did what?

STEFAN: They're gone, Lily. And you have until tonight to get out of Mystic Falls, or we come after you next.




LILY: 
 Uh, centuries-old Heretics, world-weary survivalists, wise-beyond their lifetime, eviscerated from the planet it one fell swoop?




LILY: My son, if I may offer you some motherly advice? Run.

TOWN SQUARE, MYSTIC FALLS



SHERIFF: Please join me in recognizing our graduating class of new deputies as I read their names and they receive their badges.




NORA: 
 What a happy little town this is. I bet they have the most darling funerals.

MARY LOUISE: 
 Nora, I swear your heart must be made of pure arsenic.

NORA: 
 Admit it! You love me more for it.

MARY LOUISE: 
 You know I do.




SHERIFF: Deputy Cornell Willis...




NORA: Mar... It's the 21st century. We can hold hands now.




VALERIE: Oh my God! Is this your first date in public? That's adorable.

MARY LOUISE 
 We should double sometime. There's bound to be a man out there desperate enough to buy you dinner.




VALERIE: Can we focus on revenge, please?

SHERIFF: Deputy Taylor Hall...




MARY LOUISE, NORA & VALERIE: 
 Confuso fatina...




SHERIFF: Deputy Matthew Donovan...




MARY LOUISE, NORA & VALERIE: 
 Ignos et ignos mortifina.




SHERIFF: Deputy Tim Johnson...

MARY LOUISE, NORA & VALERIE: 
 Confuso fatina, ignos et ignos mortifina.

SHERIFF: Deputy Jeffrey Morrison...




MARY LOUISE, NORA, & VALERIE: 
 Confuso fatina, ignos et ignos mortifina.

SHERIFF: Deputy Don Morris...




STEFAN: Hey, I think we have a problem.

MARY LOUISE, NORA & VALERIE: 
 Confuso fatina, ignos et ignos mortifina.




SHERIFF: Sorry for the malfunction, folks.




VALERIE: 
 Incendia!




ACADEMY GRADUATE: AHHHHHH!




MATT: 
 Help!






CAROLINE: 
 Oh my god!




CAROLINE: 
 Agh! Ugh!

NORA: Hello, neighbor.




STEFAN: Ugh! Ugh!




LILY: 
 Enough!




LILY: I fought tirelessly to reunite us, found ways to coexist in this new world, sacrificed everything to make us a family again! How dare you jeopardize that? All of you...




LILY: The bloodshed ends now.




SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



CAROLINE: 
 What just happened?

STEFAN: 
 I don't know.

CAROLINE: I thought we blew them up! How did they survive that?

STEFAN: I have no idea.




CAROLINE: 
 Matt's whole class is dead. The new sheriff? Dead. All those people, none of them even had a chance to...




CAROLINE: God, what are you looking at?




STEFAN: There's a splinter embedded in my neck, and I can't seem to get it out...




CAROLINE: Come here.




STEFAN: Thank you.

CAROLINE: 
 I almost got it.




CAROLINE: It's just, there's history here, you know? This town, and this house, these people... and I just don't see a world where Mystic Falls survives a war between us and them. And if Lily thinks she can control five Heretics, she's insane.

STEFAN: 
 ...I think I know how to get through to Lily.

CAROLINE: 
 How?

STEFAN: 
 Let's just say it's a good thing Damon's not here.

MYSTIC FALLS-- MONTAGE





CAROLINE: 
 Dear Elena... When you wake up, Mystic Falls will look nothing like you remember it.


MATT: 
 We made up a story-- a mining fire erupted in the tunnels under the town. Out of control fires, lethal carbon monoxide levels, the works.





STEFAN: 
 My mother's Heretic family is back. Their magic keeps them protected. They're faster and stronger than any of us, and they're willing to tear our town apart for their own entertainment. We had to protect it.





CAROLINE: 
 Lily thought her family was ready to live among humans. She was wrong. The truth is, their impulsive nature put every citizen in this town in danger, so Stefan negotiated a deal.





CAROLINE: 
 We got time to clear out the residents, and in return, anyone who trespassed was fair game for the Heretics.





CAROLINE: 
 Pack your things. Your family's not safe here.

MATT: 
 Stefan and Caroline went door-to-door, evacuating residents. Drove out businesses, boarded up homes, closed off the town to traffic...





CAROLINE: 
 We all gave up a lot to get Lily to agree, but I think Stefan sacrificed the most.





LILY: 
 Pick a room! There are plenty.

MATT: 
 We hate them, they hate us. But now, at the very least, we have a truce.





STEFAN: 
 Whether we like it or not, we'll share our town. We'll live side-by-side with our enemies for as long as it takes.





TOWN SQUARE, MYSTIC FALLS



CAROLINE: 
 What are you doing with my mom's bench?

ENZO: 
 Oh. I just saw it here, and I thought I'd put it in safekeeping-- spare it from any future graffiti damage.

CAROLINE: 
 Yeah. I was just about to do the, uh, same thing. What's the catch?

ENZO: 
 Come on! There's no catch. Just trying to cheer you up, Blondie. Not sure if you've noticed, but things are getting a little glum around here.




CAROLINE: 
 Oh, I'm sorry. Have... Have I not shown enough glee after uprooting an entire town of innocent people because of you?

ENZO: 
 Me?

CAROLINE: Yeah!




ENZO: No, don't clump me in with Lily's circus freaks.

CAROLINE: Well, then where should I clump you? One day, you're helping Lily, the next you're here being nice. Just pick a side, Enzo. Us or them.

ENZO: 
 Oh, God, you sound just like her.

CAROLINE: That's because she doesn't trust you. And honestly? Neither do I.




MYSTIC GRILL



STEFAN: How's Europe?

DAMON: 
 Ric was kind of "meh" on the Mona Lisa...




DAMON: Anything I should know about?

STEFAN: Eh, it can wait 'til you get back.




DAMON: Well, I'm back! Want to tell me who the hell's living in our house?




STEFAN: The whole town would have been slaughtered.

DAMON: 
 So we kill them and call it a day!

STEFAN: We already tried that.

DAMON: 
 You sent Donovan to blow up a house. Try harder.

STEFAN: 
 Look, the deal has been made. We don't mess with them, they don't mess with us.

DAMON: 
 That's very benevolent of you, brother. You should run for Mayor. Not that anyone would be here to vote for you.




STEFAN: Look, what's done is done. Do not mess this up.

DAMON: Who convinced you to save a town full of people you don't give a crap about? Because it's not your idea, and Matt can't think his way out of a paper bag, so it must be Caroline's.

STEFAN: 
 Do me a favor-- box that bottle up on your way out.




DAMON: 
 Stefan hangs up his hero-hair for the girl. And here I thought my future was bleak.




STEFAN: You know, Elena wanted you to be happy. To live. Even encouraged you to date. But, if she wakes up and everyone she loves is dead, do you think she's going to be able to forgive that?




STEFAN: I'm not doing this for Caroline, Damon. I'm doing this for you.




TOWN SQUARE, MYSTIC FALLS



BONNIE: 
 Hey!

MATT: Bonnie, hey!




MATT: I didn't know you were back.

BONNIE: I honestly don't know where I am.




BONNIE: Matt, surrendering the town is not the solution. We need to stop them.

MATT: They had been stopped, Bon, back in 1903. But then, you betrayed Kai, he let them out, and I got to bury all my buddies from the Sheriff's department.




BONNIE: So this is my fault?

MATT: 
 No. I didn't say that...




MATT: Look, I gotta go patrol.

WHITMORE COLLEGE-- BONNIE, CAROLINE AND ELENA'S DORM



BONNIE: What are you doing here?

DAMON: 
 Have you been to Mystic Falls? There is a Heretic clipping his gnarly toenails in my master bath right now. I have nowhere else to go.

BONNIE: 
 So, I guess it's a good thing I didn't get hit by a truck...

DAMON: 
 Come on, Bonnie! It was three seconds.

BONNIE: 
 Do you know how long three seconds are in a life-or-death situation?




DAMON: The first second, I thought of how amazing it would feel to have Elena in my arms again. By second number two, I was kissing her...




DAMON: And by the third, I remember you're my best friend, and that if anything ever happened to you, I would lose my mind. So, yes, Bonnie, I do know how long three seconds are.




BONNIE: 
 ...I was just checking.

DAMON: And I will wait for her, and you're gonna help me. You're stuck with me, too.

BONNIE: 
 The Heretics are out because of me.

DAMON: No, Bonnie-- the Heretics are out because my mother's a lunatic and everyone's too scared to stop her.

BONNIE: 
 I'm not. I want to fight. I want our town back.




TOWN SQUARE, MYSTIC FALLS



MALCOLM: Trespassers are free-reign, friend.




MALCOLM: And you are...?

BONNIE: 
 Town witch.




MALCOLM: To be fair, you are nothing if I take your magic.




FORBES HOUSE



CAROLINE: Are we making a huge mistake handing over our hometown to a bunch of supernatural terrorists?

STEFAN: 
 Yeah, probably.

CAROLINE: 
 Stop! I'm a control freak giving up control. I'm delicate.

STEFAN: Well, what would Sheriff Forbes do?

CAROLINE: She would protect human life at any cost.

STEFAN: Well, then, no. I don't think we're making a mistake.

CAROLINE: 
 I thought I would heal from my mom's death. I really thought that time would pass, and one day, I would be ready to move on. But, she's my mom, and I'm never gonna stop missing her.

STEFAN: 
 Well, that's life, Caroline. I mean, you can't just sit back and wait for the good parts to happen. But, what you can do is you can forgive yourself for trying to be happy during the bad parts.




STEFAN: Heh. I'm gonna go, uh, board up the front door.




CAROLINE: Hey, Stefan?




CAROLINE: I'm happy. You make me happy.




CAROLINE: Uh... uh, my best friend's gone, my mom's dead... Uh, the whole town is destroyed... But, when I'm with you, I'm happy. And yeah, you're right. I just need to...




WHITMORE MEDICAL CENTER



ASSISTANT: 
 Mr. Saltzman. It's late.

ALARIC: 
 I want to see her.

ASSISTANT: 
 Look, I get it. It's your wife. But, hospital policy says we can only keep the body cold thirty days.

ALARIC: A policy you were willing to break last month.




ALARIC: Now, I say we keep breaking it.

ASSISTANT: 
 You know, it's said that once you bury a body, the grieving process begins...

ALARIC: Well, I'm not planning on burying her. I'm planning on bringing her back to life.




ALARIC: It's a morgue. It's called gallows humor. Now, can I see her, please?




SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



VALERIE: 
 You shouldn't hide your scar, Beau. You're a survivor. Be proud.




MARY LOUISE: Valerie! Beau!

NORA: It's Malcolm!

MARY LOUISE: Help! He's dead!




VALERIE: 
 Oh, my god! Malcolm!

MARY LOUISE: We found him in town. He was just lying there.

NORA: 
 Oh, god. Don't let Lily see this.




LILY: Malcolm?




LILY: 
 No. No! No!




LILY: 
 Oh! Oh, sweetheart. Oh, my sweet boy.




LILY: 
 Who took him from us? Who did this?




FORBES HOUSE



CAROLINE: 
 Dear Elena... So, remember how I said everything was falling apart earlier? Maybe not everything...





ENZO: What is it with everyone's incessant need to write down every single feeling?

CAROLINE: 
 This whole stalker-thing is not even remotely charming.

ENZO: 
 What, even if I'm here to tell you you were right?

CAROLINE: 
 Especially to tell me that I'm right, because I already knew that.

ENZO: 
 So, uh, word on the street is that one of Lily's magical elves lost his heart.

CAROLINE: 
 What?

ENZO: 
 You didn't know?




ENZO: Yeah, someone killed Malcolm. I believe he was her eldest.

CAROLINE: 
 Well, who killed him? Because we had a deal--

ENZO: 
 Yeah, trust is a fickle thing. That got me thinking that if I want people to trust me, then I've got to earn it. That starts with choosing a side, so here I am.

CAROLINE: 
 Well, good for you. I need to call Stef--




ENZO: I reckon it goes without saying I chose Lily.

FLASH-FORWARD-- BROOKLYN, NEW YORK, 2016



DAMON: 
 I told you not to bother me until Elena was awake!

STEFAN: 
 Well, that's too bad. We got to go.

DAMON: 
 Why?




DAMON: 
 She's back!




DAMON: I guess she upped her game.




STEFAN: 
 My scar... opened up this morning. I figured she was back. I didn't realize she was this close.

DAMON: 
 You better get used to it, brother. She's not gonna stop until you're dead.




STEFAN: Come on. Ugh!
