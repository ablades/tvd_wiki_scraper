ALARIC: 
JO: 
ALARIC: So, I'll take that as a no?
JO: I just realized that tonight is my last shift as a single woman. I can't wait to marry you.
ALARIC: 
JO: Me, too.
BAKER: Dr. Loughlin?
JO: 
BAKER: I'm Officer Baker. Is there somewhere private we can speak?
JO: ...Sure.
JO: What's this about?
BAKER: I'm here regarding Professor Saltzman. I understand you two are engaged to be married?
JO: 
BAKER: Nope!
BAKER: Everything is just right.
JO: 
BONNIE: SURPRISE!
JO: Oh! Oh, my God. No. I don't think so! 
ELENA: 
BONNIE: 
ALARIC: What the hell's going on?
MATT: HAPPY BACHELOR PARTY!
JO: An entire diner to ourselves? Actual heaven.
ELENA: If Caroline were here, we would be planning a spa day.
BONNIE: But now, she's MIA.
JO: Understandable, considering...
ELENA: So, I figured we'd just stuff our faces.
JO: 
BONNIE: 
ELENA: 
BONNIE: I'm just saying, that's not exactly a Garden burger!
JO: The baby is not okay with the no-meat thing. Besides, it's my party, and I'll eat what I want to! 
ELENA: Right?
JO: Hey, I don't want to know what Ric's doing, do I?
BONNIE: 
ELENA: Yeah, or mini-golf...?
JO: 
BONNIE: So, are we gonna talk about it?
ELENA: 
BONNIE: Seriously? You're gonna make your best friend have to pry it out of you? 
ELENA: You do? 
BONNIE: Damon called me last night and he told me everything, including his insane plan to take it with you.
ELENA: 
BONNIE: He needed someone to talk to after you left the conversation without telling him what you were thinking!
ELENA: 
BONNIE: And I quote, "She stared at me like I was an alien, and then basically teleported out of the room."
ELENA: Damon Salvatore stands in front of you and tells you that he wants to become a human again. Wouldn't you freak out? 
BONNIE: But you want to be human again.
ELENA: Yeah! 
JO: You guys aren't full, are you?
ALARIC: 
DAMON: I just... I was standing there, and it just sort of came out.
ALARIC: 
DAMON: It's easy-- Elena guzzles it, goes back to her human self, I feed on her, and as long as no one sucks it out of me, then we grow old and die of the common cold.
ALARIC: Okay, so you screwed up, and now you're freaking out.
DAMON: 
ALARIC: Damon, if you take that cure, you can never be a vampire ever again, right? 
DAMON: 
ALARIC: 
DAMON: I want to be with Elena.
ALARIC: And what did Stefan say?
DAMON: 
ALARIC: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: Hmmm-- to you.
TYLER: Sorry I'm late.
MATT: Well, considering the guy who lives here tried to kill us a few days ago, I don't blame you.
TYLER: 
MATT: 
TYLER: Whoa-- beer plus pain meds equals another trip to the hospital!
MATT: You chose now to learn math?
MATT: Who the hell invited you?
ENZO: Damon. Never been to a bachelor party before!
ENZO: 
MATT: Don't know, don't care.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
ENZO: That was utterly adorable.
STEFAN: 
ENZO: Oh, believe me, there are a number of places I'd rather be... Strapped to a gurney, having my spleen cut out, for instance! Unfortunately for me, I'm here because your mother needs your help.
STEFAN: 
ENZO: Apparently, her beloved Ascendant's been destroyed. She's in bad shape. Could use a bit of your time.
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: Hello, Mother. I think it's time you and I have a talk.
Lily: This is entirely unnecessary. I was merely getting a breath of fresh air.
STEFAN: Mmm.
STEFAN: Whatchu got there, junkie tic?
STEFAN: I have the same thing. It's funny how that works, isn't it?
LILY: 
STEFAN: 
LILY: 
STEFAN: You know, Enzo told me a lot of things. Including that, after losing all hope of getting your friends back, you went off the deep end last night.
LILY: A momentary lapse.
STEFAN: 
LILY: There's nothing to talk about.
STEFAN: You know... 
STEFAN: And then my veins, they begin to itch uncontrollably, and the hunger consumes me. Every sound, every scent-- the world around me falls apart, and all I can hear is the pulsing of someone's blood, and all I feel is that it belongs to me.
STEFAN: 
TYLER: Drinking yourself to death? That's your big plan from the future?
MATT: 
TYLER: 
MATT: How's the deputy training program?
TYLER: 
MATT: 
TYLER: 
MATT: Maybe that's because Deputy Taylor's on medical leave for a week after you kicked his ass in front of the trainees!
TYLER: Yeah? Well, you know what, he had it coming.
MATT: 
TYLER: No-- that's what it is for you. Because I realized one day, doing this job might mean that I have to shoot someone. To kill them. And I don't ever want to be a werewolf again.
MATT: It doesn't have to be like that, Ty.
MATT: You just need some self-control.
TYLER: 
MATT: Control it, Ty.
TYLER: You're not worth it.
DAMON: Where are you? And please tell me you're with a stripper.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Did you know that she was the one who turned Enzo?
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: And here we thought she didn't have a maternal bone in her body.
STEFAN: She also has a bit of a Ripper-thing going on. That little stunt you pulled with the Ascendant put her in a blood tizzy.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Nope! Just love to Mom. Heh. Kidding.
ENZO: See? Now that's what I call a missed opportunity. Perfect time to tell your brother you're hanging up your fangs for a pair of khakis.
DAMON: 
ENZO: Yes, you do. I might have plied Alaric with enough alcohol to slur the news into my ear.
DAMON: 
ENZO: Yeah, once you mastered the art of returning phone calls.
DAMON: 
ENZO: What, with the prospect of taking the cure? No point in agonizing-- you won't go through with it.
DAMON: 
ENZO: You! You're selfish, Damon. Being human isn't what you really want. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like that about you. A man should be consistent. But, take it from someone who you left to burn to death in order to save your own skin-- no one changes that much. Not even under the magical influence of Elena Gilbert. 
JO: So, basically, Damon did the vampire-version of a wedding proposal, and you just walked away?
ELENA: I said I would think about it. 
JO: Trust me, I would much rather talk about that than the fact that I have yet to find a non-hideous wedding gown. Or, that I can't ask my sister to be my maid of honor because she won't return my phone calls. Or, the fact that I cannot stop eating-- literally, like ever. So, big decision. Go.
BONNIE: I think you should take it. Decision made.
ELENA: What if I miss the perks, like compelling the owner of a diner to close early for us? Or what if I get sick?
BONNIE: Or, what if the human-you doesn't love Damon anymore?
BONNIE: 
JO: That's ridiculous. Being supernatural doesn't change who you are! I should know-- I'm an ex-witch who's about to marry an ex-vampire. Deep down, you know who you are and what you want. Love's always gonna require a huge leap of faith. A big, scary leap over a hot pit of lava. And, you might end up heartbroken, but you might be the happiest person on the face of the earth. Personally? I'm glad I took that leap.
ELENA: Speak of the devil.
ELENA: 
DAMON: 
ELENA: Very funny! You may have partied us under the table, but at least I'm on a junk food high.
DAMON: Is that why you're walking around town, eating french fries? 
ELENA: 
DAMON: Oh, I'm just clearing my head. Asked a girl a really big question last night. She just sort of left me hanging.
ELENA: 
DAMON: That's all right. She's probably just doing some soul-searching.
ELENA: Want some?
DAMON: 
STEFAN: See? Sublimating can be fun!
LILY: 
STEFAN: I am not mocking you. I'm... I'm teaching you how to divert an instinctual impulse into a socially acceptable activity. 
LILY: 
STEFAN: 
LILY: But not you. You feel the need to connect. Or, is this strictly a Ripper-to-Ripper pep-talk?
STEFAN: 
LILY: 
STEFAN: You were the only person who was able to flip my humanity back on.
LILY: Damon fed me a story!
STEFAN: And it worked! All I'm saying is... maybe deep down, you still feel something for me.
LILY: 
STEFAN: Well, then let's start over-- clean slate-- and let me help you get through this. We can start something new. You just... You have to trust me.
LILY: You never could look me in the eyes when you were telling me a lie.
STEFAN: 
GIRL: Ahhhh!
LILY: 
ELENA: I love it up here.
DAMON: Soak it in while you can! And, load up on fries, because trans fat is no friend to humans.
ELENA: 
ELENA: Did you mean it when you told me you'd take the cure? Or were you just afraid that you were gonna lose me?
DAMON: Honestly? A little of both.
ELENA: 
DAMON: 
ELENA: 
DAMON: To be continued. I want to show you something.
ELENA: 
DAMON: Well, down, for starters. Unless you want to wuss out and take the stairs?
ELENA: You only live once, right?
DAMON: 
ALARIC: You know, it's bad form to drink a thousand-dollar bottle of bourbon all by yourself.
MATT: So, you're really doing this, huh? Taking the plunge, starting a family here?
ALARIC: Yeah, guess that's the plan.
MATT: Want some drunk advice?
ALARIC: Sure.
MATT: 
ALARIC: 
MATT: 
STEFAN: 
ENZO: Ahhh. Broken glassware, the overwhelming scent of fresh blood... I see the family reunion went without a hitch.
STEFAN: 
ENZO: I was looking for Damon. Word is that he took off to find Elena.
STEFAN: Yeah, well, he's not picking up his cell phone right now, which means it's just you and me.
ENZO: 
STEFAN: 
ENZO: Ahh, that's right. You haven't heard. Damon has the cure, and if we're to believe his bluster, he plans on taking it with Elena.
STEFAN: 
ENZO: Based on the look of shock on your face, you don't. 
ENZO: Ahh. So, we can either stand here and debate the merits of Damon's word, or we can split up and find your mum before she rips their heads off. Which is it gonna be?
BONNIE: Bad news-- Damon hijacked Elena. So, do you want to take this party somewhere else?
JO: Yes, to my bed, if I can walk.
BONNIE: Oh, my God.
LILY: 
JO: 
BONNIE: Lily Salvatore.
JO: 
BONNIE: I didn't do it to spite you, Lily. I did it to keep Kai trapped.
LILY: Surely there's another way to rescue my friends?
BONNIE: 
BONNIE: Now, let it go, and get out.
BONNIE: Ungh!
LILY: Your mistake.
JO: No, please! I'm pregnant!
LILY: 
JO: 
LILY: 
JO: Stay calm. I'm gonna help you.
DAMON: What's your favorite thing about being a vampire?
ELENA: Well, I guess if I had to choose one thing, it would be that I can heal people.
DAMON: 
ELENA: Okay. Well, then, enlighten me!
DAMON: I like all of it. The speed, the feed, everything so heightened... And, eternally looking great in a black leather jacket's not the worst thing. I'm forgetting something, though...
DAMON: Hmmm. Oh, I remember! Getting in people's heads is quite a bit of fun, too.
ELENA: 
DAMON: You won't remember this, but this is the first place I ever kissed you. Another very happy memory Ric scrubbed from your brain.
ELENA: But, this isn't real. It's a fantasy. You put this in my brain.
DAMON: Isn't that the point? I mean, as epic as this life is, we'd be giving up so much more if we didn't do this. I've had so much fantasy in my life, Elena. Enough for 100 lifetimes. I'd give it all up for one life with you.
ELENA: 
DAMON: 
ELENA: 
DAMON: I know you do. You've wanted this since the day you became a vampire.
ELENA: For you, there's no going back.
DAMON: 
ELENA: And, you're impulsive! And reckless!
DAMON: And madly in love with you forever! No matter how long that's gonna be. And taking this cure, Elena, won't change that. I'm ready for a little reality if you are.
ELENA: I love you.
DAMON: 'Til dead do us part. 
DAMON: How do you feel?
ELENA: I don't know. I... I kind of feel...
ELENA: It all looks so good--
DAMON: So, what looks good--
DAMON: Sorry. You first!
ELENA: How about eggplant parmesan?
DAMON: 
ELENA: Is that bad? 
DAMON: 
ELENA: 
DAMON: I was thinking five-year-anniversary.
DAMON: Hang on! I'm gonna get you home. You're gonna be alright.
DAMON: 
ELENA: I think I'm... I'm okay.
DAMON: What happened?
ELENA: 
DAMON: 
ELENA: 
DAMON: 
ELENA: Yeah, well, wait...
ELENA: It's not healing. Damon, it's not healing. That means, it's... it worked. It worked!
DAMON: 
ELENA: 
DAMON: Hang on. It's Stefan. 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Lily got away from me, so it's a really bad time to be a human.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: You were right. We've got to lock her up.
ELENA: 
DAMON: 
LILY: 
ELENA: 
LILY: 
LILY: You're bleeding. You took the cure. You're human.
ELENA: You don't want to feed on me.
LILY: Yes--
ELENA: 
LILY: --Elena, I do.
ELENA: No. No!
ELENA: Ugh! Really? Come on!
LILY: Elena!
ELENA: Focus.
JO: 
JO: No squeeze? 
JO: No, no. Don't. Don't try and talk. I heard what she said. Twins. Which means I'm number one on Kai's "Most Wanted" list. Congratulations, you have been bumped to number two. So, thank you for destroying that stupid Ascendant. And, I hope you meant what you said, that there's no way to get out of that prison world.
BONNIE: 
JO: 
ELENA: 
STEFAN: We're right outside, so get home. We'll deal with her.
STEFAN: Elena's safe. Get up. We need to find Lily.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: What do you think?
STEFAN: I think being a human is the last thing you want.
DAMON: I want to be with Elena, Stefan.
STEFAN: Do you have any idea what it feels like for me to have to hear it from Enzo? To have no say as to whether I lose my brother or not?
DAMON: Ugh, of course I know what it feels like. Why do you think I didn't tell you? Can we go find our mother?
LILY: Look what you've done to your mother. I'm a mess.
STEFAN: In a few days, or months, or years, you'll feel different.
LILY: What does it matter if I'm alone, terrified of falling off of the edge? 
STEFAN: No! No, no, no, no. You don't want to do that. Please don't do that. 
LILY: 
DAMON: You okay?
ALARIC: Hey! 
JO: It's okay! It's not my blood. It's okay.
ALARIC: How... how's Bonnie?
JO: She's fine. Damon gave her some of his blood.
ALARIC: 
JO: It's, uh, babies, actually. Turns out, there's two of them cooking in there.
ALARIC: Twins. Okay. Look, the more the merrier.
JO: Even if Kai never escapes that prison, my family's gonna try and take them from us. A new Gemini twin Merge is the only thing that can strip Kai of his power.
ALARIC: 
JO: How is that possible?
ALARIC: Because after the wedding, we're gonna disappear. We're gonna go somewhere where your family can't find us.
JO: Alaric, I can't ask you to give your whole life up for me.
ALARIC: You, the baby-- babies? You are my life, and all I care about is keeping you safe.
DAMON: Good news from the front lines-- Bonnie is okay, Jo is okay, and Lily has been laid down for a long winter's nap.
DAMON: 
ELENA: I remember everything. Every moment. It's like a million tiny, little pieces of my heart have fallen back into place. I remember the moment that we met, the moment that we fell in love... How much I didn't want to love you, but it was like... it was like, I was being swept up into a current. I-I-I was consumed by it.
DAMON: That's a good thing, right?
ELENA: Damon, I remember everything! Every kiss, every conversation.
DAMON: 
ELENA: We've already had this conversation, Damon. 
DAMON: 
ELENA: Was it? Because I remember it like it was just yesterday.
ELENA: Take the cure with me. That's how much I know this is real. That's how certain I am that I'm gonna love you ever after this is all over. 
DAMON: 
ELENA: You walked away from me because you didn't want me to change your mind, because you didn't want this.
DAMON: Hey! That was a long time ago.
ELENA: You haven't thought this through.
DAMON: 
ELENA: You're so afraid of losing me that you've convinced yourself that you can endure a human life.
DAMON: 
ELENA: Okay, fine. What about Stefan? What does he think?
DAMON: I don't care what Stefan thinks! I've made up my mind. I'm not gonna have him drown me in a fountain of guilt and have me change my mind.
ELENA: Damon, I love you more than I ever thought was humanly possible. I'm not trying to hurt you, but I can't let you do this.
ELENA: Not before you've let everyone in your life try to talk you out of it, including you.
LILY: Hello?
ENZO: Look who's awake.
LILY: 
ENZO: Just wanted to make sure you're in good hands.
LILY: Let me out, so we can speak like civilized people.
STEFAN: That's not gonna happen. 
ENZO: She's fragile. She should be around someone she trusts.
STEFAN: 
ENZO: I'll come visit, Lily. This is a family matter now.
STEFAN: You know, earlier, you asked me what it'd feel like to have something I cherished for 150 years ripped away from me. You're right. I'd be devastated.
LILY: 
STEFAN: It's never too late. That's the upside of eternity. You'll be my mother for the next century, and the one after that, and the one after that. And one day, maybe not soon, but one day... You'll see me as your son.
LILY: Stefan... 
KAI: Come and get it!
KAI: Big breakfast for a big day!
