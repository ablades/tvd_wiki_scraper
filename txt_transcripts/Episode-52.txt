Elena: So, the Lockwoods really have no idea that these tunnels are underneath their property?
Alaric: Careful where you shine that thing. Bats hate the light.
Elena: Wait, what?
Damon: Elena!
Damon: Boo!
Elena: 
Damon: Scaredy-cat!
Alaric: Just ignore him. That's what I do.
Elena: So, you really can't get in?
Damon: No. Seems even the ancient Lockwoods were anti-vampire.
Elena: What do you mean, ancient?
Damon: 
Damon: Well, this is as far as I get to go.
Elena: What is all this?
Alaric: Well, as far as I can tell, it's a story. In simple, archaeological terms, it's a really, really old story. 
Elena: 
Damon: Yeah, it's the "Lockwood Diaries: Pictionary-Style."
Elena: I don't understand. I thought the Lockwoods came here with the Original Founders in the 1860s.
Alaric: I don't know. Maybe the Lockwoods did, but according to this wall, these werewolves have been here a lot longer than that.
Elena: How long?
Damon: Long. It gets better. Show her, Ric.
Alaric: Names. They're not native. They're written in Runic, a Viking script.
Elena: Vikings?
Alaric: This name here, I translated it and it reads Niklaus.
Elena: Klaus.
Alaric: And Elijah...and Rebekah.
Klaus: Rebekah, let me have at it!
Rebekah: Quiet, Niklaus! I am to have more concentration if I am not to slice off a finger.
Klaus: Father will not like you handling the blade.
Rebekah: If I want to wield a blade, I shall wield a blade! Father need not know.
Klaus: He will find out. He always does.
Rebekah: That is because you always tell him.
Klaus: I cannot help it...he frightens me.
Rebekah: He frightens us all. That is why we stick together as one, always and forever. Right, traitor? 
Klaus: Right. 
Rebekah: Here. You finish it. I am to help mother with the meal.
Klaus: Yes, go tend to dinner, and leave the blades to the men, little sister.
Klaus: 
Rebekah: It's just a little blood. Be a man about it.
Elena: These are the names of the Original Family?
Alaric: Carved into a cave that's been here since way before the founding of Mystic Falls. Or even the entire New World, for that matter.
Elena: Okay, this has gotta be one of Klaus's fakes.
Damon: That's what I said.
Alaric: That could be true, except the last name up here made us think otherwise.
Elena: What's the name?
Alaric: Mikael.
Elena: Mikael...Mikael, as in, the vampire hunter who knows how to kill Klaus?
Damon: Yep. I now like to call him "Papa Original".
Alaric: These images tell a story....to learn the story, you have to decipher these images.
Damon: Sloppy!
Elena: Shut up! I'm new at this.
Damon: "Ghost of Christmas Past" Mason Lockwood set up the cave and led us to a weapon that can kill Klaus.
Elena: Yeah, but doesn't Mikael have a weapon?
Damon: Yes. Which probably means the wall will lead us to Mikael, who we have already found...and lost. 
Alaric: These images at the very least might tell us what that weapon is.
Elena: Then all we have to do is find out what they mean.
Damon: Fine! Fine! If I am being irritatingly optimistic like you two...how do you suppose we do that?
Elena: Well, if the story is about the Original Family living here,  then we go straight to the source!
Rebekah: You! Goody.
Elena: I was hoping we could talk.
Rebekah: About what? Stefan? Don't worry, I'm off him until he starts treating me better. In fact, you should probably take a page out of my book, if I'm being honest.
Elena: Actually, I'd rather talk about this.
Elena: I'm curious why you and Klaus have spent a thousand years running from your father.
Rebekah: I should get back to the girls. Homecoming's right around the corner. 
Elena: Well then, maybe I'll ask Mikael when we wake him.
Rebekah: 
Elena: So, then who's rotting in that old cemetery in Charlotte?
Rebekah: If you wake Mikael, we are all doomed!
Elena: So then, tell me.
Rebekah: Why do you want to know?
Elena: Why don't you want me to wake him?
Rebekah: I need to get back to the girls.
Rebekah: 
Elijah: Oh look, our sister has arrived to watch my fast approaching victory!
Klaus: On the contrary, Elijah...
Esther: Relax, Mikael. Niklaus means well.
Mikael: That is precisely my problem.
Mikael: So, why don't you teach me that trick, young warrior?
Klaus: 
Mikael: 
Klaus: Father, it was nothing...
Mikael: You are foolish and impulsive, my boy. What? No more laughter?
Esther: 
Mikael: Some days, it's a miracle you're still alive, boy.
Elena: She's going to tell me. She's scared of him, Damon. I saw her face. I just have to engage in a little "mean girl" power struggle first.
Damon: Well, make sure she doesn't power struggle you into a wheelchair.
Elena: I've got this, Damon. If we can figure out a way to kill Klaus, Stefan will be free of his compulsion. So...how does he look?
Damon: Mmm...pasty and pouty.
Elena: He'll have to get over it. Call me later. 
Alaric: You're sure about that? I mean a thousand-year-old vampire, I'm sure, has learned the art of patience.
Elena: She's a thousand-year-old vampire, who's joined the cheerleader squad...There is a whole different set of rules that play here, Ric. I got this.
Stefan: You know, if you two are gonna keep me locked in here for the next decade, I think we can skip the routine visits.
Damon: You know I'm not a big champion in this whole Lexi-Recovery-Plan...but Elena thinks this place is gonna weaken you up, break you down and make you feel again...
Stefan: We should all listen to Elena, right? I mean her plans always work out so well, don't they? Why are you here?
Damon: What are you talking about? It's Family Day at Vampire Rehab! So, I'm paying a visit to my baby brother.
Stefan: Go away.
Damon: Nahhh. I thought we could hang out, a little brother bonding. How've you been, Stef? Huh?
Stefan: You know, Klaus may wanna keep Elena alive, but that doesn't mean she's safe with Rebekah...
Damon: Liar, liar pants on fire, brother. Klaus compelled you to protect Elena, and if you thought for even a second that she was in danger, you'd be working a lot harder.
Stefan: 
Damon: Yep.
Stefan: You got me. You're good. Congratulations! You can go now. 
Damon: You really have given up.
Stefan: Actually, this is my happy face...
Stefan: What are you doing?
Damon: Screw this Lexi-plan. I think we could both use a drink.
Rebekah: 
Elena: You invited me over? To talk?
Rebekah: All right girls, have at it!
Rebekah: Okay, now twirl please.
Elena: You compelled your own private runway show?
Rebekah: I need a Homecoming dress. So, what do you think? Pick one.
Elena: I'm not here to help you shop. I'm here to talk about why you don't want me to wake up Mikael.
Rebekah: I said "pick one", Elena.
Elena: The...red one.
Rebekah: There. It wasn't so hard, was it? 
Rebekah: You do not threaten me. You'll learn what I allow you to learn. Is that clear?
Bonnie: Hey there!
Alaric: Bonnie! Come on in!
Bonnie: Got your message.
Alaric: Yeah, great! Uh, I'm sorry the place is such a mess. I'm obsessed...
Bonnie: (Holding up Elena's necklace.) I brought you the necklace that wouldn't die.
Alaric: Ahh, that's great. 
Bonnie: Been better...
Alaric: Listen, Jeremy is an idiot. And I know this with certainty, because I was once a Jeremy. Trust me, we learn...eventually...
Bonnie: It's the same design.
Alaric: So, your grandmother said this necklace belonged to the witch that put the hybrid curse on Klaus, right? Well, this symbol is repeated all across the wall. I've been trying to figure out what it meant. And now I know...
Rebekah: How fun is this...?
Elena: We shouldn't be here...
Rebekah: 'Course we should! Come on, like you've never wanted to snoop. 
Elena: Are you gonna root through his stuff all night or are you gonna start to tell me your story?
Rebekah: Ah...you really are no fun. What do you want to know?
Elena: Well, Elijah said that your father was a landowner in Europe. How did you guys end up here?
: My parents had just started a family, when a plague struck their homeland. They lost a child to it. They wanted to escape and protect their future family from the same fate.
Elena: So, how did you end up here? This part of the world hadn't even been discovered yet.
Rebekah: 
Elena: The werewolves?
Rebekah: To us, they were just our neighbors. My family lived in peace with them for over 20 years, during which time my family had more children, including me.
Elena: You make it sound so normal.
Rebekah: It was.
Rebekah: 
Rebekah: Ayana, you burned me!
Ayana: That is not yours to touch.
Klaus: (Screaming outside.) Mother!!!
Rebekah: 
Rebekah: Henrik!
Klaus: Mother!!!
Rebekah: 
Esther: No, no!! What happened?
Klaus: The wolves! I am sorry, I'm so sorry!
Esther: 
Ayana: The spirits will not give us a way, Esther. Your boy is gone.
Esther: No! No!!! 
Rebekah: And that was the beginning of the end of peace with our neighbors..
Rebekah: And one of the last moments my family had together as humans.
Rebekah: You better get that. That'll be Damon checking up on you.
Elena: Hello?
Damon: Hey!
Elena: Damon, where are you?
Damon: No idea, but I'm pretty sure I'm overdressed...Still standing?
Elena: Yes, I'm fine, but I can't talk right now.
Stefan: I'll be at the bar.
Elena: 
Damon: Yeah, I kinda went off a bit. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.
Elena: Damon! How could you let him out?
Damon: I got this back, Elena. 
Stefan: Hopefully something a little bit warmer...and a little bit blonder...
Callie: 
Damon: Hello...
Stefan: What's the catch, Damon?
Damon: No catch, brother. Drink up. It's on me.
Damon: Hi Callie.
: Drink up brother!
: You get us a bottle of this?
Callie: Yes, sir. 
Damon: You been on this "bunny diet" for a better part of 50 years. So, how is it that "Saint Stefan", of all people, is good at a drinking game?
Stefan: Oh, the "bunny diet" gave me a lot of time to practice.
Damon: Hmm...
Stefan: Wallow in despair. 
Damon: All that effort wasted trying to tell you how boring you are, and now you finally agree with me?
Stefan: Damon, you are worse than Elena. Getting me drunk, brotherly bonding - what do you think, I'll break down and you can pull me back from the edge, is that it?
Damon: I happen to like the edge, Stefan! Your problem is your inability to resist falling over it. All or nothing, man. You can't just be.
Damon: Although, who am I to judge? 
Elena: Did you get your fill of snooping yet? Can we get on with the story?
Rebekah: Honestly, I don't get you two as a couple.
Elena: Why would you? You don't know anything about who he really is.
Rebekah: I know exactly who he is. He's a vampire. We're a predatory species. 
Elena: Is that why you did that runway show earlier? 'Cause you don't care about the Homecoming Dance...You know what, I'm just gonna go.
Rebekah: You haven't even heard half the story.
Elena: And you are not going to tell it. You're just bored and looking for someone to push around. Find someone else to play with...maybe you can compel yourself a friend.
Rebekah: The necklace wasn't Stefan's to give. It belonged to the Original Witch.
Elena: 
Rebekah: Not just the hybrid curse. She's the one who turned us into vampires.
Mikael: Please, Ayana! I implore you! You must call upon the spirits before the next full moon.
Ayana: I will not! It is a crime against nature.
Esther: Ayana, we have already lost too much. We cannot lose any more...The spirits can help us find a way to protect our children.
Rebekah: I'm thirsty. Do you want a drink?
Elena: So, vampirism was a form of protection?
Rebekah: What else would it be?
Elena: A curse?
Rebekah: My parents only saw a way of keeping their children alive.
Elena: Yeah, but why stay, if they were so afraid of the werewolves? Why not...leave?
Rebekah: Pride...My father didn't want to run anymore. He wanted to fight and be superior to the wolves. Where they could bite, we had to bite harder. Where they had speed, we had to be faster. Agility, strength, senses...
Mikael: Everything could be heightened. Our family could live forever...
Ayana: At what cost? This magic you speak of breeds consequence. This is the makings of a plague, Esther. The spirits will turn on you.
Esther: Please, Ayana.
Ayana: I will have no part in it.
Mikael: If she will not protect our family...then it is in your hands alone, my love.
Elena: In her hands? How could she do anything?
Rebekah: Because my mother was also a witch.
Elena: What?
Rebekah: The witch of the Original Family. The Original Witch?
Rebekah: 
Elena: But if your mother was a witch, then...
Rebekah: Am I? No, a witch is nature's servant; a vampire is an abomination of nature. You can either be one or the other, never both. My mother did this for us. She did not turn.
Elena: How did you turn?
Rebekah: She called upon the sun for life, and the ancient white oak tree, one of nature's eternal objects, for immortality. That night, my father offered us wine laced with blood. And then he drove his sword through our hearts.
Elena: 
Rebekah: And he wasn't delicate about it either.
Klaus: 
: Blood! What happened? 
Klaus: You will be alright! We will all be alright.
Klaus: 
Mikael: We must finish what we started! 
: We had to drink more blood to complete the ritual.
: Drink! 
: It was euphoric! The feeling of power was indescribable...but the witch Ayana was right about the consequences. The spirits turned on us, and nature fought back...For every strength there would be a weakness...
Damon: Nothing to see here! 
: Hey, hey ease up! Ease up. 
Damon: Two more!
Stefan: Alright! Tell me what's up. What's the point of the jailbreak, hm?
Damon: I thought you could use a hug, Stefan.
Stefan: Come on, Damon. You know Elena is gonna hate you for letting me out. And we both know that you care about what she thinks...
Damon: Maybe I wanted to remind you what freedom was like, before Klaus took it from you.
Stefan: As long as Klaus is alive, I do what he says.
Damon: That's my point, Stefan. You've given up! Now you could sit around and be his little bitch, or you get mad enough and you can do something about it.
Stefan: Damon, he can't be killed.
Mikael: Maybe I can help with that.
Mikael: The Salvatore boys, I presume?
Stefan: Mikael.
Elena: Why did Mikael start hunting Klaus?
Rebekah: When Nik made his first human kill, it triggered his werewolf gene. With that, he became my father's greatest shame.
Elena: Yeah. Elijah told me this part of the story. Your mother had had an affair with one of the werewolf villagers. Klaus wasn't his son.
Rebekah: She tried to make it right. She put the hybrid curse on Nik to suppress his werewolf side, and then she turned her back on him. But Mikael's greatest weakness as a human was his pride. As a vampire, that was magnified. He went on a rampage and killed half the village. Then he came home and killed her.
Elena: 
Rebekah: He said she broke his heart so he would break hers. He tore it from her chest as Nik watched.
Rebekah: Afterwards, my father took off in a rage, and the rest of my family scattered. Nik stayed, so he could help me bury her. He knew I had to say goodbye to my mother.
Rebekah: I know you think she hated you, Niklaus, but she did not. She was just afraid. I'm sorry she turned her back on you. I will never do that.
Elijah: 
Rebekah: We stick together as one. Always and forever.
Elena: Always and forever...even though he locked you in a coffin for ninety years?
Rebekah: We're vampires. Our emotions are heightened. I'm stubborn, Elijah moral, and Nik...Nik has no tolerance for those who disappoint him. Over a thousand years as a family we've all made that mistake at least once. I've made it several times.
Elena: But you still love him?
Rebekah: He's my brother. And I'm immortal. Should I spend an eternity alone instead? You've heard the story, it's time to go. I said leave, Elena! I don't know what you're up to, but I'm no longer playing along.
Elena: I'm just looking for one good reason why we shouldn't wake Mikael.
Rebekah: And I've given you a thousand! But you will anyway. I know you want him to help you kill my brother, I'm not stupid.
Elena: It's no secret that I want Klaus dead. He has a hold over Stefan's life, and over mine.
Rebekah: Do what you need. Wake Mikael at your own peril. But make no mistake, if you come after my brother, I will rip you apart. And I get my temper from my father. Now leave!
Mikael: Is Klaus out of the country?
Stefan: I can't tell you.
Mikael: Has he spoken to you since he left?
Stefan: I can't tell you.
Mikael: All right. Can you tell me the last time you spoke to Niklaus?
Stefan: I'm compelled to do what he says, and he says to keep my damn mouth shut.
Damon: I really hope this game of twenty questions isn't your secret weapon.
Mikael: You see, Damon...
Damon: Well, Klaus has been running for about thousand years, so if you think you can get a work around here...
Mikael: Careful, Stefan. One move - and his heart's gone. 
Damon: 
Mikael: Really? His link to Klaus is so strong that he will let his own brother die?  No ideas, hmm? Think, Stefan! I guess you're right. He's a dead end. And so are you, Damon.
Stefan: Wait! I can bring him back. I can lure Klaus back to Mystic Falls.
Mikael: And there is our loophole. Just had to rile him up a bit. Get Klaus back to Mystic Falls, and I will gladly drive a stake through his heart. Fail, I'll drive it through yours.
Alaric: We, uh, filled in what we could. 
Elena: That's the white oak tree that was used in the spell to create the vampires...which means that was when they burned down the tree, destroying the only way that they could be killed.
Alaric: Okay. so tree equals weapon, sort of. We already knew that. What we are not sure about is this: we've got the witch symbol, and what looks like a bleeding heart. Upside down figures usually signified death, of some kind.
Elena: Mikael killed the witch by ripping out her heart. But...why is that one connected to the witch's death?
Bonnie: We don't know. We haven't gotten that far.
Elena: 
Rebekah: I thought I told you to leave. Twice.
Elena: How do you know that Mikael killed your mother?
Rebekah: Nik was there. He told me.
Elena: He lied to you.
Rebekah: And how do you know that?
Elena: The cave where you carved your family's names is covered in symbols. 
family: how your parents arrived, how they made peace, the spell that turned them into vampires, and this. This is the symbol for hybrid. It's a combination of the werewolf and the vampire symbol. And this is the one for your mother.
Rebekah: Her necklace.
Elena: And this is the story of her death. The hybrid killed the Original Witch. Not Mikael. Klaus.
Rebekah: No! No, he wouldn't.
Elena: She put the curse on him, made it so that he would be the only one of his kind, and then she rejected him. With the werewolf gene comes aggression and violence...when he turned, all of that was heightened. He killed her, Rebekah. And then he made up this entire lie about your father, so that he wouldn't lose you.
Rebekah: These mean nothing! They're just stupid drawings, done by stupid people who had no idea who my family was!
Elena: Then why are you so upset?
Rebekah: Why are you doing this to me? I've done nothing to you!
Elena: Klaus killed your mother. He has a hold on you, on me, on everyone. He has for a thousand years. We have to make it stop!
Rebekah: Shut up! Shut up! Don't talk anymore! Nothing!
Damon: I'll give you ten points for flair.
Stefan: At least, now we know where Klaus and Elijah learned their tricks from.
Damon: Don't think you had to wait till the last second to have your breakthrough, though.
Stefan: I didn't have a break through, Damon.
Damon: Oooo, Ooooo, my brother is about to die and I just had to save his life for the bajillionith time! Careful Stefan, your humanity is showing. 
Stefan: So you know what? You're right, Damon. You're right. You reminded me what my freedom felt like. And when we kill Klaus, I'll be free. Free to leave. See, I didn't do this for you, Damon. I did it for myself.
Damon: 
Stefan: Why are you doing this, huh? 
Damon: Because I have to, Stefan! Because you are in this mess with Klaus, because you saved my life. Because I owe you. And I can't just leave you in a cell to rot.
Stefan: Aw, better be careful, brother. Your humanity is showing.
Elena: Uh...Damon! Seriously?
Damon: We got Mikael.
Elena: What? How?
Damon: No idea. I guess Katherine came through. Plan's in motion. See, I told you I had it. Go ahead. Kick, yell, scream. Sure you've been planning your rant all day.
Elena: I'm not gonna yell at you.
Damon: Why not? I went behind you back. Freed Stefan. And you know what? It backfired. He's an even bigger dick than ever...just now, he's a dick that's on our side.
Elena: I'm not mad. I'm tired. I just...I want to go to bed. 
Damon: 
Elena: Well, they must have carved it from the white oak tree before they burned it down.
Damon: So I was right. After all that, the wall lead us to Mikael.
Elena: 
Damon: Really? What 'd you learn from her?
Elena: I learned, that she's just a girl. That she lost her mom too young, and she loves blindly and recklessly, even if it consumes her. 
Damon: Well, you should tell that to my brother.
Elena: 
Damon:
