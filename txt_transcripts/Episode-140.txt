ALARIC: Twenty-three minutes.
DAMON: Just enough time for me to get in, take out little Miss Stabby-Pants, and grab Caroline.
ALARIC: 
DAMON: It's simple. It's classic. Come on!
ALARIC: Yeah. Listen. I saw the "X" carved in Stefan's chest. Pretty sure she's not playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
ALARIC: Look. This is a trap.
ALARIC: Yeah. Well, look-- I didn't get a babysitter on thirty seconds notice just to sit in the car.
DAMON: 
ALARIC: 
DAMON: There's no way Stefan didn't see Caroline's broadcast. He'll be here in a minute. When he gets here, pump him full of vervain so he can't hero his way in there.
ALARIC: 
DAMON: She doesn't want Caroline. She wants him! If he goes in there, he's dead.
CAROLINE: 
DAMON: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: 
DAMON: 
CAROLINE: 
ALARIC: Well, simple enough. Two lines you're pregnant, one line you're not.
CAROLINE: And how many lines if you've been mystically knocked up by a coven of dead witches?
ALARIC: 
CAROLINE: This is crazy! I mean, you're an occult studies professor. Have you ever come across anything about a pregnant vampire?
ALARIC: No. But until a few weeks ago, I'd never heard of a stone that was full of tormented vampire souls, either.
CAROLINE: But how would it even be possible? I'm technically dead.
ALARIC: 
CAROLINE: 
ALARIC: I don't think they had a choice. The Gemini were all dying. They couldn't let the future of their coven perish along with them, so they had to put the babies someplace safe, inside a body that... that wouldn't die.
DAMON: Is that cornbread I smell?
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Whatever happened to taking out Julian? Remember him? Killed what would have been your firstborn? You know, I cleared out my entire schedule so we could make that guy count worms... Unless you're too busy baking.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
LILY: I brought cranberries!
ALARIC: Negative. I don't understand. I mean, Valerie was so certain.
CAROLINE: Well, I guess she was wrong, or playing some twisted game. Either way, I trust that a lot more than I trust her.
CAROLINE: And I'm really sorry. I know how much you wanted this.
CAROLINE: Hey, Matt... Now's not really a good time.
MATT: Bonnie and I found two dozen people compelled to hang out at the high school last night. I've been trying to call her, but she won't pick up. I'm starting to get a little worried.
CAROLINE: 
MATT: 
CAROLINE: I don't know. Were you able to clear them out?
MATT: We had to tranquilize them just to get them out of there, but they were all back this morning like they never left.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: 
MATT: 
STEFAN: I invited you over here because we can't keep doing this. I mean, I... I want us all to start over.
LILY: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: Did we, Stefan?
STEFAN: I want to convince you of all the reasons that you need to help us get rid of Julian.
LILY: I'm sorry. Is this some kind of set-up?
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: She kept it a secret from me, from you, from everyone. And Julian found out about it somehow, and he felt threatened by it. He beat her until the baby was no longer alive.
STEFAN: Her child-- your grandchild-- was murdered by Julian. She swore me to secrecy, but the truth is too important. You need to know what kind of man he is.
DAMON: What I think Stefan's trying to say is... you have really crappy taste.
LILY: 
STEFAN: Wow. I guess the joke's on me then, right? I mean, I was the idiot who believed her.
LILY: I did, too... about many things. But I will not make that same mistake again.
STEFAN: Here's to moving on then, right?
LILY: 
LILY: Ugh!
STEFAN: Concentrated vervain.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: I had a feeling we were gonna have to do this the hard way...
DAMON: Best... Thanksgiving... ever!
BONNIE: 
ENZO: 
BONNIE: Are we talking about Oscar's car, or Lily?
BONNIE: You're not doing this to stop a psychopath. You just want the girl.
ENZO: 
BONNIE: Let me give you some advice. Stop treating Lily like some prize to be won.
ENZO: 
BONNIE: 
BONNIE: Found it.
ENZO: Well, I'm assuming Julian doesn't want it for it's Bluebook value.
ENZO: Charming.
ENZO: I'll wager this is what Julian's looking for. Wonder what makes it so special?
BONNIE: I think I've seen that before... when I was doing research on the stone. Let me see what I can dig up.
ENZO: No. I don't need research to tell me which one's the pointy end. What do we need to know?
BONNIE: 
ENZO: Well, there's one way to find out-- ram it through his chest. See what happens.
BONNIE: I know what's not gonna happen-- Lily falling hopelessly in love with the person who murdered her sweetheart.
ENZO: Not if I make it look like self-defense.
BONNIE: 
ENZO: Is that a hint of concern for me I detect in your voice?
BONNIE: Now that I think about it... Go ahead and kill each other. Win-win for me!
LILY: 
STEFAN: Julian's practically brainwashed you, like Giuseppe did way-back when.
LILY: What does Gius... Giuseppe have to do with this?
DAMON: Well, you didn't think Dad was a monster at first. But, somewhere along the way, this little warning-light started blinking "Psycho! Psycho!" You just need that little light to blink again.
LILY: What are you talking about?
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: Hey, do you remember that fun-filled Thanksgiving we had back in 1851?
DAMON: 1851. Hmmm. Jog my memory, brother-- was that the year that Father took me out to the farm and made me behead my pet turkey?
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Oooh. That was a doozy.
GIUSEPPE: If I could take just a moment to say how thankful I am to the good Lord for giving me a beautiful wife, two fine boys, a table filled with fine food--
GIUSEPPE: --And a stomach big enough to fit it all in!
GIUSEPPE: Son, eat your dinner, please.
DAMON: I cannot.
LILY: What's the matter, sweetheart?
GIUSEPPE: It was not an invitation, Damon.
GIUSEPPE: Eat.
STEFAN: Why is he not eating?
DAMON: 
GIUSEPPE: That animal was put on this earth to be sustenance, not your friend! Now, you will clean your plate, or you will spend the night in the root cellar, wishing you had.
DAMON: Mother... please do not make me eat her.
LILY: You heard your father, Damon.
DAMON: 
LILY: I kept you from wasting a perfectly good meal.
LILY: I still don't see what any of this has to do with my current relationship.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: You're too blind to see it. You're drawn to men who manipulate you into seeing what they want! Men who abuse you.
LILY: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: But pointless.
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: And by the end of the day, you're gonna help us kill your boyfriend.
MATT: I found more at the courthouse and another dozen at the supermarket.
CAROLINE: What's with all the IVs?
MATT: Saline... to keep them hydrated. Which you'd only need if you were gonna keep them here for a while.
CAROLINE: They're using them as human blood banks.
CAROLINE: I guess we know what the Heretics are having for Thanksgiving dinner.
MATT: Problem is I can't find a single bite mark on any of them, which is somehow creepier. They're not being fed on. They're being fed.
MATT: I found these in the trashcan. This is salmon, steak. Iron-rich foods-- probably to boost their red blood cell count. It's like someone's fattening the cattle for the slaughter.
MATT: Whoa, Care. Hey. Um... Are you okay?
CAROLINE: Yeah, I'm fine.
MATT: 
CAROLINE: I... I think I had an expired blood bag last night or something. You know, and then the talk of the food and the iron and the slaughtered cattle...
MATT: ...So you're a vampire with food poisoning?
CAROLINE: 
MATT: 
CAROLINE: Maybe someone can siphon it away.
JULIAN: Ah, the barkeep. Did you forget your tip jar?
ENZO: You know who I am.
JULIAN: Oh... yes! The steerage waif Lily took pity upon. She told me all about you.
ENZO: Oh, that's funny. She hardly mentioned you.
JULIAN: So what brings you here?
ENZO: I left something behind that means a great deal to me-- my guitar.
JULIAN: Haven't seen one lying around. Perhaps Lily threw it out with the rest of the rubbish.
ENZO: Yeah, I doubt that.
ENZO: She loves it when I play for her.
JULIAN: Oh.
ENZO: Sometimes begs me to. There is no point trying to deny her.
JULIAN: I hope you're not suggesting anything untoward.
ENZO: 
JULIAN: Well, we'd have to settle it like gentlemen. But...
JULIAN: I assured Lily that there would be no more bloodshed in the house.
ENZO: Did you make any promises about outside?
JULIAN: Hmm.
VALERIE: You want me to siphon the compulsion out of all these people?
VALERIE: Do you have any idea how long that will take?
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: I am all for scuttling Julian's plans, but siphoning these people won't make a difference. He'll just replace them. You'd be trading one life for another.
VALERIE: Speaking of, I can't imagine this is the safest town for someone with your status to be roaming around in.
MATT: What's that supposed to mean?
CAROLINE: Nothing.
VALERIE: 
MATT: What?
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: I am not pregnant! Okay? Valerie over here convinced poor Alaric that the Gemini Coven dumped his twin babies into my...
CAROLINE: You know what? Never mind. Because it's not true.
CAROLINE: Yeah, and thanks to you, Alaric is probably still at home waiting for that second blue line to show up. So, you know what? Maybe now would be an appropriate time to call him and explain how you could get something so important so incredibly wrong.
VALERIE: Do I need to remind you that you summoned me here for my help? If you don't think my talents are up to snuff, then I will gladly find other things to do with my time.
CAROLINE: I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Maybe it was just a momentary lapse of... magical ju-ju. Look... Can you just please help us and take away these people's compulsion?
JULIAN: Do you know what true bravery is?
JULIAN: Most people don't. It isn't going against incredible odds and thinking you're going to win. No, that's merely confidence. Bravery is knowing you're going to lose, but doing it anyway.
ENZO: That's your strategy? Bore me into submission?
JULIAN: Well, if you won't let me give you an honorable way out, I... have no choice but give you an honorable death.
JULIAN: Well, let's get on with it. Choose your weapon.
JULIAN: Hyah!
LILY: 
DAMON: Huh. Does that burn?
LILY: 
DAMON: 
LILY: UNGH!
DAMON: Nope. Guess not.
STEFAN: That's enough, Damon.
DAMON: 
DAMON: I have finished. May I be excused?
GIUSEPPE: 
GIUSEPPE: Lily, a bourbon, please?
GIUSEPPE: I took this out for a special occasion today. But, in the process, I discovered quite a bit of money missing from my bureau.
GIUSEPPE: You would not know anything about that?
DAMON: 
GIUSEPPE: Stefan, have you been rummaging around your father's bureau?
GIUSEPPE: Well, it did not just grow legs and walk off, now, did it?
GIUSEPPE: Which one of you did it? Confess here and now, like a man. Who took the money?
DAMON: 
GIUSEPPE: To think of all the hard work your mother has put into grooming you to be proper young men of society. Do you really want to put her through the heartache of thinking she is a complete and utter failure?
DAMON: No.
GIUSEPPE: Then what would a man do?
DAMON: He would tell the truth.
GIUSEPPE: And the truth is...?
DAMON: I took it!
GIUSEPPE: I didn't raise you to be a thief. But, I also didn't raise you to be a liar, and you have told the truth here today. Have you learned your lesson?
GIUSEPPE: This is to make certain you remember it.
DAMON: AHHHHH!
DAMON: I didn't take Giuseppe's money. I only confessed because I was afraid of what he'd do to Stefan.
STEFAN: It's your pattern, Lily. Julian's a monster. Giuseppe was a monster.
LILY: You don't think I knew that? I was married to the man for twenty years! What kind of a fool do you take me for?
LILY: Do you think I believed you when I caught you digging for ice in the icebox, and you told me you scratched your arm playing? I'm not blind, Damon. I knew exactly what he did to you that night.
LILY: I had gone to fetch his bourbon like he asked. I was on the stairs when I heard your scream. You ran by me clutching your arm, and you didn't see me through your tears.
DAMON: And you did nothing?
DAMON: You did NOTHING?
LILY: That is not true! Everything that I did--
STEFAN: Lily!
LILY: Someone... Someone's trying to kill Julian.
STEFAN: 
LILY: 
ENZO: I see you two have met before.
JULIAN: 
CAROLINE: You took a wrong turn and ended up in Mystic Falls. Leave and forget everything that you saw here.
CAROLINE: What?
MATT: You sure you don't want to talk about this whole Valerie baby-spell thing?
CAROLINE: There is nothing to talk about.
MATT: Care, I've never seen you puke before.
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: Beau. I don't know what atrocities Julian has planned, but you're better than this. I know you. I'm your friend.
VALERIE: Julian is evil. He doesn't care about the family. He only cares about himself.
VALERIE: Ungh!
CAROLINE: Unh! Ugh. Unh!
VALERIE: 
JULIAN: Unh!
STEFAN: Here.
LILY: Thank you.
LILY: I was the one who took the money.
LILY: On Thanksgiving. It was me.
STEFAN: I don't understand.
LILY: Your father never let me have anything. I lived under his complete control. I... I had no means of my own, no access to funds.
STEFAN: 
LILY: I was trying to save us! We were gonna run away. I was gonna protect you boys. We were... we were never gonna see him again. But your father, even drunk and miserable... He was always one step ahead.
GIUSEPPE: Looking for these?
LILY: I don't know what those are.
GIUSEPPE: Train tickets. Three of them.
GIUSEPPE: Planning a trip, are we?
LILY: Oh, Giuseppe, you ruined all my fun. I thought it could be a surprise. I... I thought you could take the boys to New York for a weekend and see that new steamship we read about in the paper.
LILY: 
GIUSEPPE: You took that money, and I punished Damon for your duplicity, and you tried to steal my children from me. Should you ever attempt that again, I will take the boys far away from here. You will be alone, and you will never see them again. Do you understand me?
LILY: 
LILY: Giuseppe was a monster. He wasn't manipulating me, I wasn't blind to it. I knew it in my bones. The only thing I cared about more than leaving him was protecting your brother and you.
LILY: Everything... That I did back then... I was doing for you.
DAMON: A little tip from a professional? Next time you want to kill a bazillion-year-old psycho, don't pick a sword from the junior section.
ENZO: On the contrary, I reckon that sword was forged for that very purpose.
ENZO: Incoming.
BONNIE: Oh. You're here.
ALARIC: 
BONNIE: 
ALARIC: 
BONNIE: 
BONNIE: This one.
BONNIE: Uh, actually, I'm just gonna do my research here if that's okay with you?
ALARIC: My office is your office.
BONNIE: Great.
BONNIE: ...Do you want to talk about it?
ALARIC: Nope.
BONNIE: 
BONNIE: So, uh, Enzo found some sword in Oscar's car and is under the impression it will kill Julian.
BONNIE: Found it. This is it. Except it's...
BONNIE: Does that look like the Phoenix Stone to you?
ALARIC: Yeah. Yeah, that looks like the Phoenix stone to me.
BONNIE: Okay.
BONNIE: "The stone gives the sword its power against immortal foes. Without it, the blade is merely a blade."
BONNIE: Oh no.
ENZO: Nice aim.
DAMON: Bastard links his life to my mom's and then engages in a duel? What is this, "Hamlet" community theater? Heh.
ENZO: Wait. Back up. What are you talking about, linked himself to your mom?
DAMON: He's using Lily as a human shield. Guess he'd forgotten about the part that half the people actually left in this town hate her guts.
ENZO: Damon, tell me you did not just kill Lily.
DAMON: 
DAMON: Ungh!
VALERIE: Are you hurt?
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: You're not really the one that I'm worried about.
CAROLINE: Ugh! Isn't it possible that "Kill the psycho" and "Save the babies" just sound similar in Witch-Latin? Not to mention that you've been out of their loop for, like, one hundred years...
VALERIE: One thousand years could pass-- I would never forget that spell. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about those words.
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: 
CAROLINE: I'm willing to believe you, okay?
CAROLINE: I need you to be 100 percent honest with me, please. How do you know so much about this spell?
VALERIE: Because I've used it.
VALERIE: I was pregnant before I turned. Julian knew that if Lily found out, it would ruin his plans with her. She would want to return to Mystic Falls instead. So, he promptly ended it. But I did everything in my power to save the life inside me.
VALERIE: I didn't have an entire coven to work with... It was just me. Hard as I tried, I wasn't strong enough.
CAROLINE: But why would you having a baby make Lily want to come home to Mystic Falls?
CAROLINE: Oh. That's the big secret that you have with Stefan.
CAROLINE: The baby was his?
VALERIE: Our story may have ended in tragedy, but you have a chance to see that your friend Alaric doesn't.
CAROLINE: Valerie, the test was negative.
VALERIE: 
LILY: Don't!
JULIAN: Oh, thank God you're all right! You must have been given such a scare.
DAMON: ARGH!
LILY: What's going on here?
JULIAN: 
JULIAN: Of course, he was under the impression it would kill me.
STEFAN: What is he talking about?
DAMON: 
LILY: Take me home, please.
DAMON: What?
MATT: 
BONNIE: 
MATT: 
BONNIE: 
MATT: 
ENZO: Guess we could both use a drink.
BONNIE: I heard today didn't go so well.
ENZO: With the sword, or with Lily? Because the answer's the same.
BONNIE: So that's it? You're giving up?
ENZO: When nine Russians tell you you're drunk, you lie down. Lily made her intentions clear.
BONNIE: Good.
BONNIE: You're better off without her.
DAMON: 
DAMON: You're never gonna stop straining to find one tiny speck of redemption in Lily, and she's never gonna stop disappointing you.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: I don't want to know the whole story, Stefan! I don't want to know any more excuses, or lies, or anything that tells me anything other than the way I know it went down-- our mother faked her death, left her sons behind, started a new family, and went out of her way to forget us forever! That is the only story that matter, Stefan.
DAMON: She tossed us aside without any concern what would happen to us. As far as I'm concerned, she deserves what she gets.
DAMON: She deserves what she gets.
JULIAN: I don't know about you, but I could use a warm bath.
LILY: What were you doing in the woods with Lorenzo?
JULIAN: Well, you know me-- never one to resist a sword fight.
LILY: Except my life was bound to yours.
JULIAN: 
LILY: Julian, this... This isn't just red wine spilled down my shirt.
JULIAN: Darling, you were never in any danger.
LILY: 
JULIAN: We were boys being boys, fighting for your honor!
JULIAN: If anything, it was silly. Well, until one of your rude, misbehaved sons showed up and tried to kill us both.
LILY: Did you know Valerie was once pregnant with Stefan's child?
JULIAN: Valerie? No, I did not.
LILY: 
JULIAN: Lily! You know me. You know how deeply that I care about the family that we have built, and I would do anything to keep us together.
JULIAN: I would never have done something so revolting.
JULIAN: Listen to me, rambling on...
JULIAN: You must have been so upset today, and here I am acting like it was nothing. It would destroy me if I ever heard you.
JULIAN: Will you forgive me?
LILY: 
GIUSEPPE: I hate to see you in such pain.
GIUSEPPE: I was drunk and not myself. But the thought of losing you and my sons, it brought out a rage in me. I can't be faulted for trying to keep my family together.
GIUSEPPE: Will you forgive me?
LILY: Of course.
LILY: Of course.
JULIAN: Come here.
JULIAN: Look at me.
JULIAN: I love you, darling. I will never hurt you.
GYN: How far along are you?
ALARIC: Uh, I'm not really sure how to answer that.
GYN: 
GYN: And you're sure you're pregnant?
CAROLINE: Why? What's wrong?
GYN: 
CAROLINE: And you're absolutely sure?
GYN: Twins would be hard to miss. I'm not hearing any heartbeats either.
GYN: I'm not hearing any heartbeats, either. I'm sorry if you were informed otherwise. I'll give you some time alone.
CAROLINE: I'm so sorry.
ALARIC: No, I'm sorry... that I've been so desperate to believe this was actually possible. I, uh... I, um... I'm really sorry that I put you through all this.
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: 
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: Are you sure about that?
CAROLINE: What are you doing?
CAROLINE: 
ALARIC: ...I'm not sure you're qualified to use that...
VALERIE: Just let her.
VALERIE: You know, it never made any sense to me. The spell pointed directly at you, but the tests came up negative. And then, it hit me-- I cloaked you from Beau to protect you. Alaric's babies are the future of the coven. They would have protected them in any way they could.
ALARIC: Wait, wait-- how is this all possible?
VALERIE: They were cloaked.
DAMON: Yeah, yeah, yeah...
DAMON: Did you come back to get your dish?
LILY: 
STEFAN: What's going on?
LILY: You were right.
DAMON: 
LILY: 
LILY: I have a plan. And this time, we won't get caught.
