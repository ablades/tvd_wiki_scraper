FALLS: Four Months Ago
FALLS:
Damon: Huh. That got awkward fast.
Bonnie: What happened? Where are we?
Damon: Where are you going? Hey.
Damon: Well, I feel a fang. I'm still a vampire. Either I'm a dead vampire or Mystic Falls is no longer magic free.
Bonnie: Look.
Damon: I definitely blew that up about an hour ago.
Bonnie: Why don't we see any people? If we're still on the Other Side we should at least be able to see the living.
Damon: Where the hell are we? And I don't mean geographically.
Bonnie: I have no idea.
MANSION:
Matt: Jer! Come on, we're going to be--
Sarah: Sorry I--I needed a place to crash. Jer said it was cool.
Matt: This isn't Jer's house.
Jeremy: Well it's not yours either.
Sarah: Look it's no big deal, I can just take off.
Matt: Yeah, why don't you do that.
Sarah: Bye.
Matt: Why would you bring her here? You shouldn't be anywhere near her, dumbass. Not after what happened yesterday.
Jeremy: Caroline compelled her to forget Elena attacked her. It's not a big deal.
Matt: Not a big deal? Right, I forgot. You don't care about anything.
HOUSE:
Stefan: Hey.
Ivy: Hey.
Stefan: Uh, what are you doing?
Ivy: Um, I'm--I mean I thought it would be nice to d--completely overstay my welcome.
Ivy: I'm sorry, I thought I--never mind what I thought.
Stefan: No, no. I just--I wasn't really expecting you to...still be here. That's all.
Ivy: Right. Because why should you expect someone you spent the night with to make assumptions about breakfast. I'm gonna go.
Stefan: No, no, Ivy. I was just--
Ivy: No, Stefan I get it. I am super into you, you're intermittently into me. Breakfast, bad.
Stefan: Ivy, look why don't we...have dinner tonight. Although I should probably do the cooking.
DORM:
: It's been four months, it's time for me to let go.
Jeremy: You gonna erase Bonnie from your head too?
Elena: Missing Bonnie, makes me sad, Jer. Missing Damon makes me dangerous. Alaric will compel away any memories and then make me forget that I had him do it. I need you to keep the truth from me too. Tyler and Stefan are on board.
Matt: What about Caroline?
Elena: Somehow I doubt she'll take much convincing.
DINER:
Caroline: You said that Stefan was looking for a way to bring Damon and Bonnie back.
Alaric: I thought he was. I've been feeding him leads for months. He let me believe he was following them.
Caroline: Well, I've been a little focused on magic bubble duty. And as you can see by the lack of magic in Mystic Falls, it's a spectacular fail of a mission. And now you're telling me that this whole time no one has been doing anything to help Bonnie and Damon?
Alaric: I wouldn't exactly say no one.
CLOSET:
Enzo: Oh, just lay it down.
Witch: I don't know anything.
Enzo: You witches are also monstrously secretive. Lucky for me I'm quite gifted at unraveling the truth.
Witch: Okay, there's a coven in Oregon. They'd found a way to communicate with their ancestors before it went away. Maybe they know what happened to your friends. They call themselves the Gemini Coven. They're small and weird and they don't like outsiders.
Enzo: See? You did know something.
Witch: I just wanted you to work for it.
Caroline: Ahem.
Enzo: Ha ha, well, well well. Well, there's a blast from the past. Hello gorgeous.
DORM:
Elena: Talk me through it again?
Alaric: I raided the psychology department's research library, and a nutshell would be using a combination of hypnotherapy and memory reprocessing techniques.
Alaric: The more we talk, the more you'll relax and open your mind to me.
Alaric: We're going to be searching through memories that are deeply embedded, and each significant memory that we hit which is connected to Damon I will help you modify. And this should eventually lead us to the signature memory which once erased will create a positive domino effect through all your other memories.
Elena: Can't you just compel me to forget everything at once? Or we can go get a beer?
Alaric: I am supernaturally rewiring three years of your memories. If it were that easy, I wouldn't be so terrifying.
Alaric: I have some questions. Answer them honestly.
Elena: I will answer everything honestly.
Alaric: Do you have doubts about this?
Elena: Yes. But I know I have to do this.
Alaric: Are you afraid?
Elena: More sad than afraid.
Alaric: Why sad?
Elena: Because I don't want to stop loving him.
Alaric: Do you trust me, to be digging around in your mind?
Elena: I trust you completely.
Alaric: Okay. Well then let's--let's get started...Who is Damon Salvatore?
Elena: He was my boyfriend, I loved him and he died.
Alaric: And when did you first meet him?
Elena: I was in high school.
met:
Damon: Katherine.
Elena: No, I'm Elena.
Damon: I'm Damon.)
Alaric: And what was he like?
Elena: There was something different about him, dangerous. But not in a way that scared me. He was exciting.
met:
road: I don't know what I want.
Damon: Well, that's not true. You want what everybody wants.
Elena: What?)
Alaric: And how did he make you feel?
Elena: Like anything was possible.
Alaric: You had a nice moment in the road with a stranger. But that's all he was, a stranger.
Elena: Stranger, two people passing in the night.
Alaric: Are you okay?
Elena: Hmm, yeah let's just keep going.
OTHERWORLDLY:
groans: How many more streets are we going to wander?
annoyed: How many times are you going to ask me questions I don't have the answers to? Huh?
Bonnie: There's something weird about these cars.
Damon: Yeah, they're all 20 years old or more and yet they look brand new.
Damon: And that is Elena's not-so-burnt-to-a-crisp house.
confusedly: Hmm?
Damon: Look.
Bonnie: Rare solar eclipse expected to be seen across 12 states?
eyes: The date.
Bonnie: May 10th, 1994. Is that--? Are we--? But that's impossible.
Damon: I don't think we should be asking where we are, I think we should be asking when we are.
DORM:
Alaric: Tell me about this moment.
porch:
Damon: No, you know what? If I'm going to feel guilty about something, I'm going to feel guilty about this.
: He kissed me. I mean, I shouldn't have let him. I knew that he was in love with me, and even though Stefan and I were on the outs, I shouldn't have let him.
Alaric: He kissed you, you thought it was inappropriate. You told him so.
Elena: I told him it was wrong.
Alaric: Who is Damon Salvatore?
Elena: He was my boyfriend.
Elena: I loved him, and...he--he died.
Alaric: You know, why don't we--why don't we take a little break, okay? To be honest, I could use a drink.
OTHERWORLDLY:
Damon: Where is any booze in this empty retroville?
Bonnie: It feels so weird to be back here, I practically grew up on this porch.
Damon: Alright, talk me through it.
Bonnie: Before the Other Side collapsed, my Grams said that she made a sacrifice so that I could find peace.
Damon: The part where you actually have a theory.
Bonnie: Well, this clearly isn't peace, otherwise I wouldn't be stuck here with you.
Damon: Rude.
Bonnie: She must have--I don't know, sent me somewhere. And when I held your hand...it took you with me.
Damon: Well, did she happen to whisper a safe word in her last breaths. A clue, maybe? Witchy path out of here?
Bonnie: No, but if we got here by magic, magic should be able to get us out.
Damon: And that frown that's not upside down is telling me what?
Bonnie: Phesmatos incendia
Damon: Still can't do magic.
Damon: Perfect.
PARK:
Elena: You're the last person I think would object to me erasing positive memories of Damon from my head.
Caroline: Yeah, but we are literally chasing a lead. W-what if we find something out? Yeah, you know what if Damon returns home and everything returns back to normal? And you're just sitting there all confused and weird?
Elena: Then Alaric will bring back my memories.
Caroline: But--
Elena: But what? Go ahead, Caroline say what you need to say. I don't want to...pressure you into agreeing.
Caroline: I--don't know what to say, I was actually trying to think of what Bonnie would say.
Elena: And?
Caroline: And...she'd say that you should do what's best for you.
Elena: Look, I think it's great that you still have hope, I really do but--for my own survival I need to let him go.
Caroline: Well, then go on with your what-would-bonnie-bennett-do plan.
Caroline: I'll make bumper stickers.
Elena: I love you.
Caroline: I love you too.
Enzo: Girl bonding, very sweet. I heard you dropped out of school.
Caroline: And I heard you were a lurker who was spying on my life. When do we exit?
Enzo: Soon, uh. You should reconsider. Looks can only get a girl so far these days.
Caroline: Yeah, well I'm not taking feminist tips from a guy who just used his tongue to get secrets out of a coat check girl.
Enzo: Garment detendant.
Caroline: You just made that up. So, did you also make up the 'Gemini Coven' lead too? Because I've never heard of them. Who are they?
Enzo: No idea, that's not where we're headed.
Caroline: What?! Wu-Wait, where are we going?
Enzo: You'll see.
GA: STEFAN'S HOUSE:
Stefan: Hey.
Ivy: Hey.
Stefan: Perfect timing, I was just uh--
Ivy: I ran into some of your friends.
Stefan: What? Where?
Enzo: Stefan! You are a hard man to track down. Uh, I wasn't sure if you're new..friend would invite us in but she said that this was your place. Which means...open invitation to all your mates, right? (Enzo rubs his hands together again.) Got any bourbon? (He walks out of the camera, leaving it on Caroline. She looks a bit angry with her arms folded, she exchanges a look with Stefan, who looks a bit guilty.)
Enzo: Good stuff, mate.
Ivy: So, how do you guys know Stefan?
Caroline: He and I went to high school together. He used to date my best friend. (She cuts a glance at Stefan.)
Caroline: Not that he's not allowed to date, I mean they broke up. I just didn't realize that he had met someone. So how did you meet exactly?
Stefan: Uh, Ivy's car was in the shop, where I work.
Caroline: You work at an Auto-Repair shop?
lips: It's relaxing.
confused: Why? What did you used to do?
Enzo: Ah, man of all seasons, jack of all trades. (He looks toward Ivy.) You have a lovely clavicle.
Ivy: Oh, Thank you. I think.
Enzo: Forgive me, I--always notice a woman's neck. I'm a neck person! So is Stefan, right Stefan?
Stefan: Not anymore.
Enzo: Ah, well that's silly. You can't just stop being a neck person.
Caroline: Is Enzo your boyfriend?
Caroline: Ugh, oh god no. Would you date that?
Enzo: Uh, hello. I'm right here, I have super-sensitive hearing. Practically supernatural. Do you believe in the supernatural, Ivy?
Ivy: I've...never really thought about it.
Enzo: I myself, am I believer. Had to get a witch to do a locator's spell to find my buddy here.
OTHERWORLDLY:
Bonnie: I didn't know you cooked.
Damon: I don't. How'd you sleep? Me... not good. My 1994 mattress was very lumpy. Whatcha got there?
Bonnie: Oh, Ms. Cuddles, I lost her when I was nine. But I went into my house last night and...here she was. (She lifts up the book she had been carrying.) I also found this at my Grams's house. Her old grimoire.
Damon: Yeah, well I found this. Drank it last year when Ric died. (He removes the CD that was playing.)
Bonnie: So we're in this snapshot of another time, or...something.
Bonnie: Everything that existed in 1994, still exists.
Damon: For better, or for worse?
Bonnie: Listen, there was a time when I couldn't practice magic. This grimoire taught me alot, maybe...I can reteach myself.
: If you were still a witch. Which with our luck, and your skill--probably ain't the case.
Bonnie: Would a little support kill you?
Damon: You know, I am acutely aware that we are in some otherworldly time dimension. However, do you ever think for one second that maybe it's you being negative reacting to my natural self negative-ly?
: You're ridiculous.
Damon: Nope, I'm consistent. (Damon puts two pancakes onto a plate and sets it in front of Bonnie.) Eat your pancakes. Oh, and--(He grabs the newspaper from the counter and drops it in front of her.)--you can do a crossword puzzle.
Bonnie: Oh, gee, thanks--(She picks it up.)--breakfast with my least favorite person, and a crossword puzzle, from 1994. (She turns her back to him, opening the paper.) Alright, what's a seven letter word for--
Damon: You've got to be kidding me. Bonnie, look at the date on that paper.
: It says, May 10th, 1994. It's the same day as yesterday.
Bonnie: We're living the same day all over again.
Damon: Well that proves it, we're in hell. Our own personal, custom-built hell. And you're in it with me. (Damon raises his bourbon.) Bottoms up. (He drinks.)
MANSION:
Matt: A little early for that, don't ya think?
Jeremy: It's dark out.
Matt: I meant in life.
Matt: Where's Sarah?
: Don't know, I'm not her keeper.
: I'm going for a jog.
Sarah: You guys don't like each other very much, do you?
Jeremy: He's trying to give me purpose.
Sarah: Why didn't you tell him I was still here?
Jeremy: Didn't feel like it.
FALLS:
Tripp: Hey, five miles with the group this morning wasn't enough for you?
Matt: Tripp, hey. I'm just blowing off some steam, what's up?
Tripp: That girl, from yesterday, the one with the animal bites. You know where she ended up?
Matt: Yeah, at my house. I'm not sure how that happened.
Tripp: She there now?
Matt: No, she split, why?
Tripp: I have some deputy buddies over at the station, one of them said that the sheriff ran the plates and the car came up stolen.
Matt: You're kidding.
Tripp: No, you know I can be paranoid but if there was a bad element coming through town. I want to keep tabs on it.
Matt: Yeah.
Tripp: So, let me know if she shows back up at your place?
Matt: Yeah, I will.
DORM:
Elena: It was the Miss Mystic Falls pageant. Stefan was supposed to be my escort but...
: He bailed on me.
: Damon stepped in. )
: He saved me from being embarrassed, in front of everyone.
: He took my arm, and led me out with the rest of the girls and all their dates and we danced. I remember that was the first time, I felt it.
up: Felt what?
him: How sexy he was. I'd never let myself notice until then, I mean obviously I knew he was attractive but...I didn't want to see him that way.
: You went down the stairs and no one was there.
Elena: I was embarrassed but I got over it.
Alaric: Who is Damon Salvatore?
Elena: He was my boyfriend, I loved him and he died. (She puts her hands on her head in frustration.) Ric, I hate this. I mean, wha--? How much longer is it going to take?
Alaric: Until we find that signature moment. The moment you knew you loved him.
Elena: Well, that's easy. It was after I found out about the sire bond. Everyone kept telling me that my feelings weren't real but I knew that they were.
: Okay, your feelings were because of the sire bond, who is Damon Salvatore?
Elena: He was my boyfriend--
Alaric: That's not it. You gotta dig deeper, earlier.
Elena: I-I- I don't know, okay I--maybe it was when we spent the night at the motel together, I wasn't back together with Stefan yet and--
Elena: And all I could think about was kissing him.
Elena: I wanted to kiss him so badly.
: No one kissed anyone, who is Damon Salvatore?
Elena: He was my boyfriend--
Alaric: That's not it, next.
Elena: I don't know, Ric!
Alaric: Well think about it, Elena! Think about that moment where you knew this person was somebody you had feelings for. That you loved, that you could see those feelings going on forever. Trust me, you never forget.
Elena: Maybe we should just forget about this entire thing, it was a stupid idea, okay I-I can't do this anymore, alright? I'm done. I'm sorry.
OTHERWORLDLY:
Bonnie: What's a seven letter word for kill me now?
Damon: That joke got old six weeks ago.
Bonnie: And so did this crossword puzzle. Everyday for two months I've done this stupid thing and I still can't figure out 27 across. Old tongue twister, Eddie turned top 40?
Bonnie: I hate pancakes!
abruptly: You know I've been trying!
Damon: And failing. Further evidence, we're in hell. Not only am I stuck with you, I'm stuck with the useless version of you.
: Did you hear that?
says: What would I have heard, Bonnie? We're the only two people here, we were the only two people here two months ago and the only two people here now!
Bonnie: Well I swear I heard something!
Damon: Maybe it's the sound of existential despair. I hear that's what hell sounds like.
Bonnie: You know what? You think we're trapped in your hell? I have to spend everyday on repeat with the person I like least on this earth--! Maybe we're trapped in mine.
HOUSE:
Enzo: So, Stefan, tell us, this house, very charming. When'd you get it?
: About a month or so ago.
Ivy: No, more than that, remember? We met two months ago and you already had it.
Caroline: You've--lived here for more than TWO months?
Stefan: Yeah, I guess I have.
Caroline: Well, I guess that's just weird because, you know; everyone thought you were living somewhere else.
Caroline: And you're job was supposed to be investigative work not Auto-Repair.
Stefan: Right. Well, I've moved on from that job.
Caroline: Well, you can't move on from investigative work until you've solved the investigation, Stefan.
Stefan: How 'bout we just drop it? I'm happy doing what I'm doing now, and that's all that should really matter, right?
Enzo: There, darling. No need to make a scene. Really it's all just some big misunderstanding, perhaps this will clear it all up.
Ivy: OH MY GOD!
Caroline: ENZO!
pain: What the hell is wrong with you?
Enzo: So many secrets, what are you running from, Stefan?
Ivy: Um, I-I don't--
Caroline: Calm down, come with me. Let's go upstairs. (She turns to Enzo angrily.) No need to make a scene?!
Enzo: What kind of coward gives up on his own brother?
Stefan: You don't know what you're talking about.
Enzo: Why don't you enlighten me?
HALL:
Caroline: Hey, this is really not a good time.
Alaric: I'm sorry, I-I've just really hit a wall with Elena. I just need some insight.
Caroline: Okay, what's the wall?
Alaric: I'm trying to get her to figure out when she first fell in love with Damon but she--can't seem to get there.
: Yeah, because she doesn't want to admit what everyone already knows.
Caroline:)
Caroline: That she fell in love with Damon while she was still with Stefan. (The stairs creak behind her and she turns, it's Stefan. He looks at his feet.)
RETURNS:
Stefan: You should probably get him out of here. He'll be up soon and I really don't feel like another go-around.
silence: I'm sorry that you heard what I said.
Stefan: It's fine, Caroline. I really don't care.
Caroline: Why? Why don't you care? You're the one who always cared, it's what I liked about you. You know amidst all the crazy in our perfectly-messed-up lives, you cared more than anyone. So how could you just--stop?
Stefan: Cause I had to. I had to 'move on'. You know, the months before I moved here I was following every lead that Alaric sent my way. I spoke to every witch, every shaman, every psychic in 20 countries around the globe, and every lead was a dead end.
Caroline: But Enzo has another lead, there's this coven in Oregon--
Stefan: The Gemini Coven, yeah I looked into them too, Caroline there was nothing there. Because there's nothing we can do, Damon and Bonnie are DEAD. I had to come to terms with that. And once I did, I had to start over, I couldn't just live my life with my old friends, I couldn't just go near Mystic Falls or Elena or--
Caroline: Or me? (They look at each other, Stefan looks away guiltily.) Cause I thought we were closer than that, I mean--you could hear in all those messages that I left you, you couldn't hear that I was completely falling apart without you? (She stares at him for his response but Stefan is still looking down, guiltily, her face straightens in realization, she looks away from his face.) Cause you never listened to them.
Stefan: I had to move on I didn't have a choice. (Caroline looks extremely sad, and appalled, her eyes are filling with tears.) I had to erase everything.
: Well, let me summarize them for you. You're a dick, if you want him out of your house, you'll throw him out yourself.
DORM:
receiver:...is not available, please leave a message.
Elena: Luke, where are you? I need more of that stuff like--now, I'm starting to go--(She pauses when Alaric is standing by the door, but then she continues to take the stuff from the box.): I don't want to hear it, Ric, okay? We tried, it didn't work. It's over.
Alaric: It didn't work because you weren't being honest.
Elena: I wasn't--are you crazy?
Elena: I was being completely honest. Do you think I want to talk to you about my romantic life?
Alaric: You weren't being honest with yourself.
Alaric: Look, I want to hear all the Damon stuff--while you were still with Stefan.
: No, I was completely faithful to Stefan.
Alaric: Of course you were--
Elena: I did everything--
Alaric: I know--
Elena: I stuck with him, even when he lost his humanity--
Alaric: I know you di--
Elena: After he left a trail of bodies from Florida to Virginia, I fought for him.
Alaric: I know you did, Elena, you don't want to admit it because you feel like you're betraying Stefan but this won't work until you do.
Elena: No, I loved Stefan. The entire time, I never would have hurt him.
Alaric: Elena, you've been lucky enough to love two people this deeply, in your young life. There's nothing wrong with that. It's okay.
: It's okay to love them both. (She turns to stare at Alaric.): That's what Katherine used to say. (There are tears in her eyes, as she slowly sits on the bed.) How sad is it that my own evil doppelgänger was smarter than me?
Alaric: It's okay, Elena you can tell me, tell me the moment you knew you loved him.
says: It was my birthday.
OTHERWORLDLY:
: Damon and I spent the entire summer looking for Stefan.
: And I was trying to put on a good face because Caroline was throwing this party for me but I was just so sad.
: I was two seconds from deciding that I wasn't going to go, I wasn't going to leave the room.
: Until Damon walked in to give me my...birthday gift.
Flashback: Elena turns when she sees Damon, and smiles.)
DORM:
Elena: It was the necklace that Stefan had given me, I'd lost it.
Flashback: Damon approaches Elena with a small box and he opens it. It's Stefan's necklace.)
: And Damon knew what the necklace meant to me.
Flashback:
Elena: My necklace.)
Elena: What it meant about my feelings for Stefan. Even though he loved me.
Flashback: Elena picks up her hair so Damon can put the necklace on.)
: He gave me the one thing that represented hope for me and his brother. I knew how much it hurt him. But he did it.
Flashback: Elena turns to Damon after he's finished.)
OTHERWORLDLY:
DORM:
: It was...the most selfless that he's ever been, and in that moment...I loved him. I didn't want to, I mean, I--It terrified me but, for that moment I loved him.
OTHERWORLDLY:
DORM:
Elena: Do it.
: It's okay, I'm ready.
Alaric: I need you to be sure. Are you sure?
Elena: I'm sure, just take it away, please. (Tears are streaming down her face.)
Alaric: Damon never came into the room, he never gave you the necklace. The party was miserable, but you spent the night at your house watching movies and eating popcorn with Jeremy.
Flashback: Damon snaps Jeremy's neck in 2x01, Elena falls down next her brother and looks up with hatred for Damon.)
Elena: Jeremy. (She said in realization.) Damon killed Jeremy, he snapped his neck right in front of me.
Alaric: Elena, who is Damon Salvatore?
angry: He's Stefan's brother, he's a monster. (She turns away with hatred.) Then he died.
HOUSE:
Caroline: Hey.
: Put on some party clothes and come to Whitmore. Tyler's coming over and we are going out.
: You sound good.
Elena: I am good, I had a good day. I ditched all my classes and hung out with Ric, and we um...we talked about Bonnie.
Elena: I had a good cry, and I don't know I--I really feel like things are taking a turn for the better. So get your ass down here and let's have some fun.
Caroline: Well, how about I come in, sneak in the dorms and spend the night later, for old times' sake.
Elena: Sounds perfect, love you.
Caroline: Love you too.
Enzo: Oh, well that was a bit of a bust. (He notices that she's sniffling and that she's not turned to him and his expressions turns into one of concern.): Hey, hey. (Enzo grabs her face and turns her to him, he sees her crying and he looks angry, he lets her go.): I'll be right back. (Enzo leaves Caroline sobbing in the car.)
HOUSE:
Ivy: Hey, did your friends leave? (She notices the broken table.): Whoa, what happened?
Stefan: Oh, you know my friend he's a...a bad drunk.
smiling: Yikes, well at least your friend Caroline seemed nice.
: Yeah, well I'm going to go throw this out. (He heads into the backyard, and when he returns into the house Enzo has Ivy by her neck with both his hands.)
forward: Let her go.
Enzo: Okay. (He snaps her neck and she falls to the ground.)
Stefan: No! (Stefan superspeeds toward Enzo but Enzo throws him back onto the ground, and slowly approaches him.)
Enzo: I've got a girl out there crying over you, because she cares so much. (Stefan sits up but doesn't attack Enzo, his eyes are wide in shock.)
Enzo: I'm over here trying to figure out why, because I can't see what's worth caring about.
Enzo: You know Damon once told me that he promised you an eternity of misery. And I remember thinking "well what could his brother have ever done to inspire so much hatred?" But now I get it...you're not a brother to him. Brother's don't give up. (He takes a step forward.) So every time I see you doing anything that looks like you've done so, every time you try to start over in a life that's nothing but a lie, I will make you pay.
Enzo: I will be the one to bring you the misery you deserve.
breathless: See? We're all still neck-people.
MANSION:
voicemail: It's Bonnie, leave me a message.
talking: Hey, it's me. I paid your cell bill again, your Mom said I could, I think she felt sorry for me or something. Maybe she just wants to hear the sound of your voice too, what do I know? I'm so pissed at you, Bonnie. Yeah, still. You--you told me that you were gonna die over the phone. So you kind of deserve me railing at you on voicemails that you're never gonna get. I guess I'll call and yell at you again, tomorrow.
Jeremy: Ah! You scared the hell out of me.
Matt: Shh, we've got a little problem. Sarah's shady, the plates on her car are stolen, she's gotta go.
Jeremy: What are you? Deputy Dewey? How do you know that?
: It doesn't matter how he knows it, he's right. I stole it from my old boss, he had wandering hands to I wandered my hands to his car keys.
Matt: Look no offense, but you've gotta find someplace else to stay.
Sarah: I totally get it, I appreciate you guys helping me, really I do. It's okay, I have family here. Sort of, I mean, I haven't met him but my Dad. He supposedly lives here. It's not like he's just going to let me sleep on the street, right?
Jeremy: Matt, at least let her stay until she finds her Dad.
Matt: Seriously, Jer? I'm on the community protection committee and she's a car thief.
Jeremy: Alright fine, we can go stay at Stefan and Damon's, no one's there.
Matt: You can't leave, I told Elena that I'd watch out for you.
Jeremy: It's not like she can do anything about it.
MORNING:
phone: So she says she has family here.
Tripp: That's probably another lie but I'll look into it, thanks Matt.
: Look Jeremy's a good kid, he's just going through some stuff.
Tripp: I know all about him, I grew up with his Dad.
Matt: Wait, you're from Mystic Falls?
Tripp: Born and raised, till my parents split. I think that's why I'm such a geek about this town. My family were such big supporters, we're the founding family actually.
Matt: Which family?
Tripp: The Fells, I'm Thomas Vincent Fell III, to be exact. My dad called me Tripp, and I was such a clumsy kid that I took my Mom's maiden name when he bailed. I mean, can you imagine? 'Tripp Fell?'.
Matt: So if you're a founding family, that means you know all the stuff that go along with it, right?
Tripp: Oh, is there a secret handshake that never got taught? Look, I gotta go, I'll see you later for training though, yep?
Matt: Yeah, sure.
Tripp: Any final words?
