Emerald Coast One Year Ago




Mason: All right, Carlos. That's it for me.




Jimmy: Mason!

Mason: Hey Jimmy. Easy. Let's get you home.

Jimmy: Screw you!




Jimmy: I know about you and Marla.

Mason: What are you talking about? You've had too much to drink.




Mason: Dude! What's up?! It's me, Mason! I'm not messing with Marla. You know that!




Mason: You don't want to do this buddy.

Jimmy: I'll kill you!




Mason: Jimmy? Jimmy?

Lockwood Mansion

Tyler: Wait, the guy died? You killed him?

Mason: He kept coming at me. He got in his head that I was sleeping with his girlfriend.

Tyler: Were you?

Mason: No. No. I wouldn't do that, he was my friend. He was drunk and attacked me. It was self-defense.

Tyler: And it triggered the curse.

Mason: On every full moon, I lose control. If I don't sedate myself and chain myself down, I'll kill anything in my path. You have to be careful. All it takes is an accident, a car wreck. Any death at your hands and you'll have a lifetime of this. You don't want it Tyler, trust me.

Mason: All right. Where's the moonstone? A deal's a deal. I answered your questions.

Tyler: Um, yeah, I'm not sure but I'm guessing it's in here.




Tyler: My dad, he was very kooky about his hiding spots but I figured most of them out over the years.




Tyler: It's all yours.




Tyler: Are you gonna tell me what's so important about this rock or what?

Mason: I told you, it's just something I want. Sentimental value.

Tyler: Yeah, I'm not really buying that. Why do you really want it?

Mason: Do you know where it is or not?

Tyler: No, I figured it would be in here, man.

Gilbert Residence




Jeremy: I can't believe Tyler Lockwood is a werewolf.

Elena: We're not sure about that yet. The only thing we know for sure is that Mason Lockwood is.

Jeremy: It should be enough easy for us to figure it out.

Elena: There is no us. I said that I wouldn't keep things from you anymore. That doesn't mean that I want you involved in it.

Jeremy: By definition of being in this family, I'm involved.

Elena: This is dangerous, Jeremy. You have to stay out of it, okay?

Jeremy: Alright. Just saying.




Stefan: Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.




Elena: Hi.

Stefan: Hey.




Stefan: Are you ready for today?

Elena: No. I hate fighting with you, even if it's fake.

Stefan: I know but if Katherine thinks that we are fighting, then she will think that she's winning and it keeps her from following through with her threats.

Elena: Yeah. But it doesn't make it any easier. Neither does knowing that Caroline will be there, reporting everything back to her.

Stefan: Hey, everything's gonna be okay. Yes, we have to keep up this ruse for a little while but the best way to keep Katherine from hurting anybody, from hurting you.

Elena: Just promise me that she won't get her way with us. We can fake a fight, we can pretend that her threats are tearing us apart but none of it is real, okay?

Stefan: Okay, how about this? Today, when we're fighting, if I say "I can't do this anymore, Elena", what I'll really mean is that I love you.

Elena: And when I say, "Fine Stefan, whatever", well that means I love you too.




Forbes Residence




Caroline: Are you off today?

Sheriff Forbes: The Historical Society Volunteer Picnic is today. You're the one who signed me up.

Caroline: I know. I just assumed you'd bale.

Sheriff Forbes: No. I'm gonna spend the whole day with my daughter.

Caroline: You're gonna pretend to be a mother?

Sheriff Forbes: I'll bring my gun if it gets rough. Come on, give me one day. I've been buried in work mode, I've barely seen you.

Caroline: Well be warned, I'm in a mood.

Sheriff Forbes: Goody for me. What was Elena doing here so late last night?

Caroline: Elena wasn't...yes um...Elena was here. She just needed to talk. Her and Stefan are going through a rough patch.

Sheriff Forbes: Is everything okay with you?

Caroline: I'm fine.

Sheriff Forbes: It's just lately you seem different.

Caroline: I'm not different, I'm fine.

Sheriff Forbes: I know you think I don't notice these things but I do. What's going on with you?

Caroline: You know there's pretending to be a mother and then there's reality. Let's not push our luck, okay?




Public Park




Carol: This is all part of the historical society, continuing efforts to give back to the community. Thanks to the generous donation of the Fell family. We are now standing on the sight of our newest public park. Thank you to everyone who has shown up today to lend a helping hand. Thanks.




Mason: Stefan right? The other Salvatore.

Stefan: The nice one. The one offering an apology.

Mason: Not interested.

Stefan: Look, my brother acted impulsively.

Mason: You think?

Stefan: If you and Damon keep at each other throats, somebody innocent is going to get hurt and I don't want that. You have family here so I can imagine you'd want that either. So what do you say we just quit the whole alpha male fighting thing and call a truce?

Mason: I made that same offer to your brother. He turned it down with a knife.

Stefan: He made a mistake. I'm here to make sure that neither one of you make another one.

Mason: Tell your brother to watch his back.




Stefan: Well, I'm guessing that he only has to worry about that during a full moon. Otherwise you're not as strong, am I right? Or you would have killed Damon by now. There's one of you. There's two of us. I think you're the one that needs to watch his back.

Mason: If he comes at me...

Stefan: He won't.




Damon: What are you doing?

Stefan: Negotiating peace on your behalf.

Damon: I don't want peace.

Stefan: Consider it opposite day.

Damon: Stefan, please tell me you don't seriously think a hand shake just solved our problem.

Stefan: No, actually I think that the first chance Mason Lockwood gets, he's gonna drive a stake through your heart and then through mine, all because you took it upon yourself to try to kill him. So thank you, because we don't have enough problems.




Mystic Grill




Sarah: When did Jeremy Gilbert get so cute?

Aimee: Oh no, stay away, that guy's damaged goods.




Jeremy: Hey man, how have you been?

Tyler: Since when?

Jeremy: I don't know, I haven't seen you much since your father's funeral. I just figured maybe you'd want...

Tyler: I'm fine, Gilbert.

Jeremy: Yeah, okay.




Tyler: Wait, hold up. I'm sorry. Bad day, bad month. Listen, you were cool that day, at the wake. Thanks for that. I felt like kind of a freak show.

Jeremy: Yeah, I know the feeling well. What are you doing here?

Tyler: Distracting myself.




Aimee: Hey, thanks for the text. Where too?

Tyler: My place. My mom is gone all day. Empty house, fully stocked bar...

Aimee: Margaritas?

Tyler: Sure.




Tyler: You in?

Jeremy: Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

Aimee: Let's do it.




Public Park




Sheriff Forbes: Oh thanks Mason.

Mason: Hey Sheriff, you've got a second?

Sheriff Forbes: I'm out of uniform. Let's go with Liz.

Mason: Alright Liz. I was hoping to talk to you about the council.

Sheriff Forbes: I don't know what you're talking about.

Mason: I know you and the others founding families have a secret council.

Sheriff Forbes: If that were true then you'd know it's a secret and isn't discussed with non-council members.

Mason: I know I rejected all that but it's only because I wanted a life outside of this town, not because I was a non-believer. Look, I know vampires exist and you have two of them living right under your nose.

Sheriff Forbes: Really?

Mason: Yeah.

Sheriff Forbes: Who would they be?

Mason: Damon and Stefan Salvatore.

Sheriff Forbes: That's impossible. I know Damon Salvatore. Do you know what he's done for this town?

Mason: I know it's a lot to digest.

Sheriff Forbes: No. I watched him kill vampires. He's an ally; he's part of the Council.

Mason: Think about it. When did the vampire attacks begin? When Damon and Stefan Salvatore moved to town?

Sheriff Forbes: They walk in the sun, Mason.

Mason: They've evolved. It's not 1864. They figured it out, Liz.

Sheriff Forbes: No. Damon Salvatore is my friend.

Mason: What if I can prove it to you?






Caroline: So suddenly, she's in the running for Mother of the Year just when I'm trying to avoid her the most. I'm babbling, you don't want to hear all this.

Elena: Oh, no, sorry. Then what happened?

Caroline: Well, I was a bitch which is par for the course with us. So, how are things with you and Stefan? Anything?

Elena: No, not since the fight. He's been pushing me away because he thinks that Katherine might get jealous enough to hurt me. I just don't know how to change his mind.

Caroline: You said that Katherine's dangerous. Maybe he's got a point.

Elena: Yeah, I know that she's dangerous and I know that he's just trying to protect me but it feels like giving up and I just...

Caroline: Just what?

Elena: I just thought that we were stronger than that.




Damon: Hey, I saw you with Mason earlier. What was that about?

Sheriff Forbes: Oh, I ah, I just asked him to help with the cleanup in the woods.

Damon: That's why I'm here for, put me to work. Should I go help him?

Sheriff Forbes: Oh no. You know, he's...I'm sure he's fine.

Damon: Are you okay, Liz? You seem really upset.

Sheriff Forbes: It's Caroline. We had a moment.

Damon: Is there anything I can do?

Sheriff Forbes: No, Damon. Thank you. It's just horrible parental skills paying off in spades. (She walks off.)




Caroline: Oh, oh. Longing looks are being exchanged.

Elena: I'm gonna go talk to him.

Caroline: No, Elena. I think it's a bad idea.




Damon: What's her problem?

Caroline: Don't worry about it.

Damon: Why are you being such a bitch to your mom?

Caroline: Don't worry about it.




Elena: Do you still care about Katherine?

Stefan: Don't do this. Please don't turn this into something that it's not.

Elena: So this is not for discussion. That's what you're saying?




Stefan: No, I'm saying that this isn't up for discussion right now because we have ears on us.




Elena: Okay, when?

Stefan: I don't know.

Elena: I saw her Stefan. It's like we are the same person. How could you hate her and be in love with me?

Stefan: You're reaching. I'm not...I'm not Damon.

Elena: How about we don't bring Damon into this right now?

Stefan: You know, I can't...I can't do this anymore, Elena.




Elena: Fine, Stefan. Whatever.




Damon: Relationships are about communication.




Lockwood Mansion




Aimee: Where is mine?

Tyler: Have at it.




Aimee: Thanks for having us over. I think Sarah's got a thing for Jeremy.

Tyler: Well, good for Sarah.

Aimee: Look, I'm really embarrassed about slutting it up with you that day at the swimming hole. I'm really not like that, I promise you.

Tyler: You don't need to apologize.

Aimee: Friends?

Tyler: Yeah, sure.






Sarah: Can I see?

Jeremy: No, no. No way.

Aimee: I want to see.

Tyler: Yeah, let's see. What's Van Gogh got going on?

Jeremy: Okay, yeah. Check it out.




Sarah: Ooh, scary demon wolf thing.




Tyler: What's this about?




Jeremy: Just some sketches. You still draw, Tyler?

Tyler: A little, but not much. You know, I've got something I'm actually working on. Come on, I'll show you.

Jeremy: Yeah. Okay, sure.




Aimee (to Sarah): You're gonna need a drink.

Tyler (to Jeremy): I mean, it's nothing special, it's pretty much amateur hour over here.




Jeremy: Oh man, I've seen you said before, it's great.

Tyler: It's on the desk.




Jeremy: Aah, I...don't really see it there.




Tyler: What were those pictures about, huh?

Jeremy: I can't...I can't breathe!

Tyler: Answer me! Why? Why wolf pictures?

Jeremy: Because...because I know.

Tyler: You know what? You know what Jeremy?!

Jeremy: I know what you are.

Public Park




Mason: Thank you.

Girl: You're welcome.




Damon: Well, Mason. Working hard?

Mason: Doing my part.

Damon: I heard you talked to Stefan.

Mason: Nice guy.

Damon: Yeah, a lot nicer than me.

Mason: Nice is overrated.

Damon: That's what I thought. Huh!

Mason: You have a good day, Damon.




Stefan: Please tell me that you were just bonding.

Damon: So what's up this faux drama in your relationship?

Stefan: What are you talking about?

Damon: Oh come on, Stefan. You and Elena don't fight, especially not over me.

Stefan: Drop it, Damon.

Damon: With pleasure.

Girl: Would you like some lemonade?

Damon: Thank you, sweetie.




Stefan: What's wrong?

Damon: (gasping) Vervain! Vervain!




Caroline: You okay?

Elena: No.

Caroline: You know, maybe it's for the best.

Elena: It's not for the best, Caroline. None of this is for the best. I'm sorry, okay? I...I don't mean to take it out on you. You're just being a good friend.

Caroline: No, I'm not. I'm not being a good friend at all.




Caroline: Is she leaving? Where is my mom going?




Sheriff Forbes: Look, I can't talk here. Just get Jess and meet me down the hill at the entrance. And bring a...yes we need it.

Caroline: What's wrong?

Sheriff Forbes: Nothing. I just have something...

Caroline: You mean work? You've surprised me. You last longer than 5 minutes.

Sheriff Forbes: It's important.

Caroline: It always is.

Sheriff Forbes: (Breaking into tears.) I'm sorry.




Elena: What's going on?

Caroline: I don't know. Something's up.




Damon: I'm gonna kill him.

Stefan: Listen to me! Sit! Sit!

Damon: I'm not listening anymore of your "give peace a chance" crap. He's dead!

Stefan: Okay. I don't like it. He's making threats. He could expose us. We need to put him down.

Damon: Alright. Let's do it.




Damon: Woods. Trash duty. Come on.




Elena: Where are you going? What's going on?

Caroline: I need to be able to hear better.

Elena: Hear what?

Caroline: Something's wrong, Elena.

Elena: Caroline...

Caroline: Shh.

Woods




Damon: Don't look so surprised. You knew this was inevitable. Go ahead, run. I'll give you a head start.






Caroline: Oh god.

Elena: What is it?

Caroline: Stefan and Damon.

Elena: What?




Sheriff Forbes: Thank you, Mason.




Lockwood Mansion

Tyler: How do you know about all this?

Jeremy: My uncle John left this old diary lying around. It was written by a crazy Gilbert ancestor who wrote about this curse that ran in your family.

Tyler: A curse about what?

Jeremy: Werewolves. It's crazy, right? But then, Matt was attacked by a wolf under a full moon and your uncle had just gotten back to town. It was too weird. Is it true?

Tyler: About my uncle? Yeah.

Jeremy: But you...you're not?

Tyler: A wolf? I'm sorry, werewolf? No. I mean, not yet. Just saying that out loud, I sound insane.

Jeremy: I don't think so but then again, I always did believe in the crazy stuff.

Tyler: According to my uncle, you have to trigger the curse. Somebody has to die at your hands, like a murder or an accident. I basically have to cause death and then boom: next full moon I'm howling on all fours.

Jeremy: Is that why he came back? To tell you all this?

Tyler: Yeah, right. He had to tell me. I caught him. He's not here for me.




Tyler: He's here for this.

Woods




Mason: It's down the stairs to the left.

Sheriff Forbes: Careful. The wooden bullets and vervain won't keep them down for long. What is this place?

Mason: Old slave quarters from the original Lockwood house.




Sheriff Forbes: Thank you, Mason. I appreciate all you've done. We got it from here.

Mason: You're gonna kill them, right?

Sheriff Forbes: Yes. That's why you should go. Here it's the Council, not the law. You can't be a party to this. It's for your own protection.

Mason: Liz, I don't care about...

Sheriff Forbes: Yes but I do, and I'm not asking. Goodbye Mason.

Mason: Don't take any chances.






Elena: What is it?

Caroline: They've been here.




Elena: What?




Mason: What are you two doing out here?

Elena: Have you seen Stefan?

Mason: Yeah Elena, I've seen him. Seen Damon too.

Elena: Where are they?

Mason: You don't need me for that. I'll let your friend here sniff them out.




Mason: Does your mother know what you are? I'm happy to tell her.




Mason: Don't be stupid! Necks snap easy around here.

Caroline: I can take you.

Mason: Wanna bet?

Caroline: Yeah. I do.




Caroline: I told you.




Caroline: Come on.






Sheriff Forbes: This is how it's gonna work. Answer me and you don't get shot, understand? How many of you are there?

Damon: Liz, please.




Sheriff Forbes: How did you fool us? How do you walk in the sun?




Sheriff Forbes: I will drag this out painfully.

Damon: But you're my friend.

Sheriff Forbes: Our friendship was a lie. Answer me and I'll kill you fast.




Elena: What is that?




Sheriff Forbes (heard by Caroline): He's not gonna tell us anything. Kill them both.

Elena: Caroline. Caroline, what is it?

Caroline: My mom. She's killing them.

Elena: What?!




Caroline: No, no, no, no!

Elena: We have to stop her!

Caroline: No, I can't. Elena, she's gonna find out about me. Elena!






Sheriff Forbes: Let's do this. Each with a stake in the heart, then burn them both.




Sheriff Forbes: Check it out.




Sheriff Forbes: Elena! What are you doing?

Elena: You can't kill them. I'm not gonna let you.






Deputy: What was that?

Sheriff Forbes: Who else is with you?




Caroline: Hi mom.




Damon: You need to drink some deputy blood.

Stefan: No. I'm gonna be fine. It's just gonna take a little bit longer.

Caroline: Damon's right you know. If there's ever time to break your diet...

Elena: He said he didn't want it, okay?

Damon: This is a most unfortunate situation. Two deputies dead and you.




Damon: What am I gonna do with you?

Caroline: You won't tell anyone, will you? Mom? Mom? Please. Look, I know that we don't get along and that you hate me but I'm your daughter and you'll do this for me, right? Mom, please. He will kill you.

Sheriff Forbes: Then kill me.

Caroline: No!

Sheriff Forbes: I can't take this. Kill me now.




Damon: But you were gonna drag it out so painfully.




Caroline: No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

Stefan: Damon, don't!

Elena: Damon, please!

Damon: Relax guys. No one is killing anybody.




Damon: You're my friend.




Damon: We've got to clean this up.

Lockwood Mansion




Jeremy: What is it?

Tyler: It's a moonstone. I looked it up online. It's a natural rock but there supposed to have all sorts of supernatural legends attached to them.

Jeremy: Why didn't you give it to him?

Tyler: Because he wants it. I'm a dick that way. It's important to him for some reason but I don't trust the guy so I'm not just gonna hand it to him.




Sarah: Found you!

Aimee: Hey, you guys are missing all the drinking.

Sarah: Oh, I'm sorry. Were you two having a moment?

Tyler: No, we're good.

Sarah: Hey, hey, what is that?

Tyler: It's...woah, hey.




Aimee: Pretty.

Tyler: Okay, let's not play with the rock.

Aimee: Well, come and get it.

Tyler: Look, I'll play along for a little bit but seriously, give it back.

Sarah: Lookie here.




Sarah: Snooze, you lose.




Tyler: You're lucky. You're cute when you're drunk.

Sarah: I want Jeremy to come get it.

Tyler: Give me a break.

Aimee: Sarah, don't be a bad drunk.

Sarah: Jeremy, come upstairs with me. See how a bad drunk I can be.

Jeremy: I'm good, thanks.




Jeremy: Sarah!

Aimee: Sarah, oh my god!

Tyler: She fell!

Aimee: She's not moving. Oh my god.




Sarah: I fooled you.

Aimee: Oh my god.

Sarah: You pushed me down the stairs!

Jeremy: Look, he didn't mean it okay? You got her?




Salvatore Boarding House




Caroline: Hey, sorry that took forever. I just didn't know how long my mom was gonna be here.

Elena: Damon says it'll take three days tops for the vervain to leave her system. Maybe even sooner.




Caroline: Hey! You get some bunny in you?

Stefan: Yeah, I'm feeling much better, thank you.




Sheriff Forbes: A stomach bug. Yeah, it came on fast. I'll definitely be out tomorrow...

Damon: Tsk, tsk, tsk.




Sheriff Forbes: ...or longer. I'll text you. Yeah. Good night.




Damon: Thank you. It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's secure. Brought you a good thread count. And once the vervain's worked its way out of your system, I will compel you, you will forget everything and you will be a free woman.




Sheriff Forbes: Can you keep Caroline far away from me please? I don't wanna see her.

Damon: She's your daughter, Liz.

Sheriff Forbes: Not anymore. My daughter's gone.

Damon: You have no idea how wrong you are about that.




Elena: Stefan, I think that we should...what are you doing?

Stefan: Katherine took a little vervain every day and built up a tolerance to it...I could do the same with blood. I could learn to control myself on it.

Elena: But you can't, Stefan. You don't have to.

Stefan: I almost died tonight, Elena. Because I was too weak.

Elena: But the last time that you drank human blood...

Stefan: I told you I'll find a way to stop Katherine, didn't I? Well this is it, this is the only way because she's stronger than me. And unless that changes this, I can't protect you.

Elena: (Tapping her ear, indicating others might overhear.) Can we talk about this later?

Stefan: He can hear us wherever we are, because he drinks this. This is...this is the only thing that can help me!

Elena: (Half whispering.) Are you serious? Are you pretending to fight? Because I can't tell if...

Stefan: No, this is real. No more pretend.






Elena: Can I take you home?

Caroline: (Shaking her head.) I can't go home.

Elena: Why not?

Caroline: Because I'm scared.

Elena: Why are you scared? Caroline, you can talk to me.

Caroline: Katherine's gonna be there and she's gonna want me to tell her everything that happened today. She told me I had to spy on you and report back to her.

Elena: I know and I've been so mad at you. But then, I tried to put myself in your position so that I could understand why you would do this to me and to Stefan because he's been such a friend to you. Who did she threaten?

Caroline: Matt, she threatened Matt and I'm so scared of her Elena! I am so scared of her.

Elena: And you should be. Caroline, we all should be.

Caroline: Why is she doing this? What does she want?

Elena: That's the million dollar question.




Lockwood Mansion




Mason: Hey Sheriff, it's Mason Lockwood. I just want to make sure everything went okay today. I didn't see you later and...give me a call will you?




Mason: Hey.

Tyler: I almost killed a girl today.

Mason: What?

Tyler: It was an accident. I was being stupid. She's okay though but there I was, y'know, and just for a moment, for a split second, I hoped she would die. Look, whatever this is inside me, I don't want any part of it. I don't ever want to feel that way again. I won't. I can't.

Mason: I know.




Mason: Thank you.

Tyler: Yeah.

Salvatore Boarding House




Elena: Caroline's sleeping on the couch.

Damon: I heard and you?

Elena: I'm going home. (She goes to the door, but stops.) What you did for Caroline's mom, that's the Damon who was my friend. (She opens the door to leave.)

Damon: Hey, Stefan didn't drink the people blood, if you were curious, but he needs to and deep down you know that.




Stefan: You can come in.

Elena: Do you really think that you can control it?

Stefan: I don't know but if I don't try...

Elena: So a little bit every day?

Stefan: Yeah, just a few drops of blood in my system. I think it's worth trying.

Elena: So do I, but I don't want you to do it alone.




Stefan: What are you doing?




Elena: It's you and me, Stefan. Always.




Woods




Katherine: I've been waiting.

Emerald Coast One Year Ago




Katherine: Mason? What happened?

Mason: Jimmy attacked me.

Katherine: What? Why?

Mason: He said that I hit on Marla.

Katherine: Why would he think that?




Mason: He's dead. I killed him.




Katherine: Everything's gonna be okay.




Woods




Katherine: What was that stunt today that you pulled with Damon and Stefan Salvatore?

Mason: I thought you would be happy about that.

Katherine: I told you to stay away from them.

Mason: Why do you even care?

Katherine: I don't want you to get distracted. I need you to find the moonstone.




Katherine: You got it?

Mason: I got it.
