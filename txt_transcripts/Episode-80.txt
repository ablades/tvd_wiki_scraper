Vaughn: Something botherin' you?
Damon: Would you believe me if I said mosquitoes?
Vaughn: Aye, I would. How does it feel when a relentless eating machine is draining the blood from your veins?
Damon: Itchy.
Vaughn: Your friends from Mystic Falls think you're funny, Damon?
Damon: You obviously know who I am and where I'm from. Have you been spying on me?
Vaughn: Aye, I have. 
Damon: You wanna know something, just ask.
Vaughn: I've been killing vampires my entire life. Still, this thing refused to reveal itself to me. That was, until three days ago and it just magically completed for no apparent reason.
Damon: Come on, man. Do I look like I know anything about tattoos? Look at my skin. It's flawless.
Vaughn: Ah! You're not taking me seriously. 
Caroline: 
Elena: I wish I weren't.
Elena: 
Caroline: Well, where's Damon in all this?
Elena: 
Caroline: Meaning what?
Elena: Meaning somebody probably jumped him and then grabbed him!
Caroline: Do you think Shane took him?
Elena: No, I mean, he's not strong enough to take Damon on, even with the element of surprise. He must have someone, or at least a few someones helping him.
Caroline: I'm so sorry. I wish I was there to help.
Elena: Well, maybe there's something you can do from home.
Caroline: Anything. Tell me.
Elena: So Shane's looking for the cure. We think we can find him. We have pictures of Jeremy's tattoo, but we just can't translate the map.
Caroline: Unless you get the Hunter's Sword from Klaus.
Elena: 
Rebekah: He'll never give up the sword.
Stefan: Yeah, but if anyone's gonna get him to give it up, it's Caroline.
Rebekah: He will never give up the sword, not even for Caroline. He's terrified we'll use the cure against him to make him mortal, and even if he wasn't, he wouldn't want any of us to derive a moment's worth of happiness from being human.
Stefan: Well, maybe he doesn't have to give it up. I mean, Klaus is stuck in Elena's house by Bonnie's spell. He can't go anywhere. There's only so many places you can hide a three-foot piece of metal.
Caroline: I'll find it, don't worry. Just e-mail me photos of Jeremy's tattoo. I'll find the sword, and I'll call you back.
Elena: Thank you, Caroline.
Caroline: Bye. 
Klaus: 
Caroline: Nope.
Massak: This is as far as I go.
Shane: We're on the brink of a monumental event in human history. We're going to raise the most powerful immortal creature that ever was. Come on, our work's not done yet.
Massak: Mine is. You said get the kid and the witch. I did. I wanna get paid now.
Massak: I'll say a prayer for your souls.
Bonnie: 
Shane: The core of that tombstone is made up of Qetsiyah's calcified blood. In some witch circles, that stone's more valuable than the Hope Diamond. So...so who wants to go down first?
Klaus: Well, if it isn't little orphan Lockwood. Come to show how laughably impotent you are against me?
Tyler: I'm just trying to help my friends find the cure.
Tyler: Found this in your attic.
Klaus: And you think finding the sword brings you closer to the cure?
Tyler: You tell me. I was playing around with the handle on the ride over, and I found this.
Klaus: And what do you think 'this' is?
Caroline: 
Klaus: Right. Well, might I suggest using the magic of the internet to purchase an Aramaic-to-English dictionary from your nearest retailer. 
Tyler: 
Caroline: It's a dead language. It hasn't been used since, like, biblical times.
Klaus: Qetsiyah's native tongue, I'm guessing. You know, even if you had the best dictionary in the world, it could take days to translate. 
Caroline: What does that mean?
Klaus: 
Elena: And once again, everyone's life is in danger looking for this cure because poor Elena can't deal with being a vampire.
Stefan: No. Everyone's here because they want to be. Not just for you, but for themselves too.
Elena: Stefan, why didn't you tell me that you wanted the cure for yourself?
Stefan: I mean, why wouldn't I want to take it? I've seen every side of vampirism there is. The power...the misery, the guilt. In the long run, even the good parts kind of suck, too.
Elena: Yeah, I mean, I know why you would want to take it, but what I'm saying is...why didn't you tell me?
Stefan: Because it had nothing to do with you. I mean, you know how much I wanted a human life with you. Being human myself, being normal -- that's something I've wanted since long before I met you.
Elena: Well, I'm glad you told me now.
Stefan: Yeah, what's a deeply buried personal secret between friends, right?
Elena: Between friends? I like that.
Damon: Mind telling me where we're going?
Vaughn: At the wishing well lies an entrance to a crypt. In the crypt lies Silas. And with Silas lies the cure, which will allow me to kill Silas, bring the mission of the brotherhood of the Five to an end. You're my leverage, Damon; I use you to get your witch friend to open the passage to Silas' crypt for me.
Damon: What a minute, you're using me to get to Bonnie Bennett? Whoa, brother, ha! You picked the wrong vampire.
Vaughn: I guess we'll see about that.
Damon: Here's the deal, Shrek. My witch friend will open the passage for you. No leverage necessary. We don't care about Silas. All we want is the cure, so you cut us in on your share, and we'll get out of your hair.
Vaughn: You really don't understand, do you?
Caroline: Okay, this is it. We've translated all the symbols on the tattoo. 
Damon: 
Vaughn: Silas is immortal. I have to cram the cure down his throat in order to kill him.
Damon: Yeah, what does that have to do with me and my friends?
Klaus: 
Tyler: What are you doing?
Klaus: I don't need to tell you my reasons. Caroline. Bring my sword over here.
Vaughn: I need to use the cure against Silas. Your friends, they can't exactly have it, now, can they?
Damon: So you use it on Silas, and we'll use it for whoever wants to use it.
Klaus: "Silas rests on the far side, the means of his destruction at hand." 
Damon: You don't want to share it with us?
Vaughn: Even if I wanted to, I couldnae.
Damon: And why can't you share it?
Vaughn: So it is written.
Klaus: 
Caroline: What does it mean? 
Vaughn: There is only one dose.
Jeremy: You okay?
Bonnie: Yeah, I just slipped. 
Jeremy: It's okay.
Bonnie: Thanks. 
Shane: 
Jeremy: 
Bonnie: Do you trust me?
Jeremy: Yeah, of course.
Bonnie: Then trust me when I promise I won't let Shane raise Silas.
Jeremy: 
Bonnie: Don't worry about me. I'm fine. But if Shane tries to lift a finger on his hand to hurt either one of us...I'll kill him myself.
Rebekah: Hello?
Caroline: 
Rebekah: Got it. Thanks.
Klaus: 
Rebekah: 
Klaus: You sound so surprised, little sister.
Rebekah: 
Klaus: 
Rebekah: 
Klaus: 
Rebekah: 
Klaus: 
Rebekah: 
Damon: You touch me again--
Vaughn: And you'll what? Threaten me? Sorry if you're upset about the cure, Damon, but we've got road to cover.
Damon: I don't care about the cure. In fact, I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to be a vampire. You know what? If I wasn't a vampire, then I wouldn't be able to do 9 of the things I'm gonna do to you when I'm free. 
Vaughn: Right.
Damon: All right, I admit, okay? My friends want the cure, and I want them to have it, and I get very upset when I can't provide for my loved ones. But tell me something, Vaughn, if all you're worried about is Bonnie the teenage witch, then why'd you save Jeremy and Elena yesterday?
Vaughn: How did I do that?
Damon: Big guy. White paint all over him. You stuck a hatchet in his spine.
Vaughn: I don't remember doing such a thing.
Damon: We're on a remote island. There's you, me, and a bunch of unpleasant locals. You expect me to believe that someone else took out that monster truck of a human being that went after Jeremy and Elena?
Vaughn: I'm telling you, it wasnae me.
Damon: Was that you?
Vaughn: No. You?
Damon: No.
Vaughn: 
Shane: It's just amazing, isn't it? Once we raise Silas, all of our sacrifices will have been worthwhile; we'll all have what we want.
Bonnie: Or he'll kill us all.
Shane: Listen, you're going to see I'm right. Just so you don't get any ideas, remember, anything happens to me, something a lot worse will happen to you.
Jeremy: All right, where is this stupid magic passage she needs to open?
Shane: Just look for anything that looks out of place, all right? Anything not occurring in nature like a - like a drawing or an inscription or a...geometrically perfect circle!
Shane: 
Elena: What did Caroline say?
Rebekah: I don't know. We lost the signal. Come on, this way.
Rebekah: 
vampires: all we have to do is jump.
Elena: Wait, wait. Um...maybe you should leave the map behind. In case you fall, you don't want anything to happen to the phone.
Rebekah: Are we doing this again? I thought we were a team?
Stefan: 
Rebekah: There's something you should know about the cure.
Shane: You're doing it, just breathe, all right? Focus on what you can do. Don't be afraid of what you can't.
Jeremy: You can do this. Remember, just like you taught me. You're in control.
Shane: That's it. It's just like drawing breath. Now just pull the power into you.
Vaughn: Looks like your witch is casting her spell.
Stefan: So you're sure that Klaus is telling the truth? That there's only one dose of the cure?
Stefan: Well, I guess that's what happens when you're dumb enough to hold out hope.
Rebekah: There's still hope for one of us. But even if I felt pity for you, if I wanted to ease your pain so I gave you the cure to take for yourself, you'd give it to Elena, wouldn't you?
Rebekah: That's what I thought. Well, I'm sorry that it couldn't work out the way that we all wanted it to.
Jeremy: Bonnie! Bonnie!
Bonnie: 
Jeremy: 
Bonnie: We did it.
Shane: 
Bonnie: Best to stay off it, then.
Shane: Bonnie. Wait, wait. Don't-- Come on. Bonnie! Help me! Come on, please! Help me!
Damon: Well, here we are. Looks like someone beat us to the punch.
Vaughn: That's a shame, Damon. I have no use for you anymore. Hate to kill ya.
Damon: Ditto. You know, that pesky hunter's curse and all. 
Vaughn: I'll make it quick and painless.
Damon: Wish I could make the same promise.
Damon: I'm gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna get to that damn cure, and I'm gonna give it to the girl that I love.
Vaughn: Your attachment to your friends will be the end of you.
Damon: 
Elena: There's only one cure? 
Stefan: I'm sorry.
Elena: Don't be. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.
Stefan: How so?
Elena: Things changed the minute that I went off that bridge, Stefan. Even if I could be human again, I wouldn't be the person that I was. 
Stefan: The rest of your life...sired to Damon.
Elena: I guess we'll have to deal with that when I get home. 
Stefan: And after what we did to Kol, if we don't ram that cure down his throat, he'll kill us all.
Elena: Pity party over. We have to go.
Tyler: Every time I think I have him, that son of a bitch gets the upper hand.
Caroline: We won't let him hurt you. Stefan and Elena will bring back the cure.
Tyler: If they get to it first! And if they don't, Klaus kills me. 
Caroline: Wait, hang on, okay? Gosh! Before you get all doomsday, just-- At least let me try and talk to him.
Tyler: He's got nothing to lose, Care. His brother's dead, his hybrids are gone. All he wants right now is blood, starting with mine.
Caroline: I'm not gonna say goodbye to you again, do you understand me? Let me fix this. 
Damon: Are we gonna dance or are we gonna play?
Rebekah: You know he can't hurt me, Damon, unless he's got the white oak stake.
Vaughn: Oh, he doesn't, but he's got other toys.
Stefan: 
Damon: You're wasting time. Just get the cure. Go.
Elena: We're not gonna leave you.
Stefan: No, we aren't. 
Bonnie: Look at us. 
Jeremy: I'm glad we're here together.
Bonnie: Me, too.
Jeremy: 
Bonnie: This way.
Jeremy: How do you know?
Bonnie: I just know.
Grams: Hello, Bonnie.
Bonnie: 
Bonnie: What are you doing here, Grams?
Grams: This place allows the living to talk to the dead.
Jeremy: Bonnie, what's going on?
Bonnie: 
Grams: It's okay. You're here now. And you are this close to bringing me back to life for good.
Bonnie: How?
Grams: Silas can do it. All you have to do is reach him and feed him, and everything will go back to the way it was.
Jeremy: Bonnie, stop! 
Bonnie: What happened?
Jeremy: Silas. He was in your head. He was trying to control you.
Bonnie: And Shane. Illusions of his wife. That's how Silas controls him.
Jeremy: You need to block him out of your mind. Close your eyes. 
Caroline: 
Klaus: Not only can I, I have to. I have a reputation to uphold. Moreover, I want to.
Caroline: I'm not asking you to forgive him. All I'm asking is that you let him live, somewhere far from here.
Klaus: So he gets to live a happy life after he turned all my hybrids against me, after he tried to kill me, after he made it his life's mission to find the cure so he could use it against me--
Caroline: 
Klaus: Do we? 
Caroline: It doesn't matter. There's only one, so it's not like I'm gonna get it anyway.
Klaus: But if you could...you wouldn't, would you? 
Caroline: Then show me. You know how much I love Tyler. You can see how scared I am to lose him. If you and I are so similar, then show me your compassion. Show him the mercy that I would show you.
Klaus: Mercy? For Tyler? Very well. Tell him to leave town immediately. 
Caroline: Of course. 
Klaus: Tell him that this is the mercy I extend for your sake...that I will give him a head start before I kill him.
Stefan: All right, come on. We have to catch up.
Damon: 
Stefan: And what? You don't care to be that one anymore? You finally decided it was easier to just walk away?
Damon: There's only one dose of the cure, Stefan. She wants to take it, you want her to. I don't. Just do what makes her happy, Stefan.
Stefan: Things have changed. It's not that easy anymore.
Damon: 
Elena: Stefan? 
Woman: 
Elena: 
Caroline: How many times are we gonna have to say goodbye?
Tyler: At least this time we have a minute to do it the right way.
Caroline: 
Tyler: This isn't goodbye. This is...until we find a way. We're immortal, remember? We will find a way.
Caroline: What if we don't? 
Tyler: 
Caroline: Until we find a way. 
Shane: Hey, I don't suppose you'd want to share a little of that vampire blood.
Stefan: Where are Jeremy and Bonnie?
Shane: I have no idea.
Stefan: 
Shane: 
Stefan: 
Shane: 
Stefan: 
Shane: Come on. Come on!
Shane: Caitlin. I'm sorry, Caitlin. I failed you.
Caitlin: No. You didn't.
Shane: I'm sorry. I tried.
Caitlin: 
Jeremy: 
Bonnie: I don't think it is, Jer.
Jeremy: It's stuck. Help me move it.
Bonnie: It's, like, fossilized in place. It's like trying to bend stone. 
Jeremy: What? 
Bonnie: He's been frozen like a vampire statue for 2000 years. There's only one way we're gonna get the statue to unfreeze.
Jeremy: How's that?
Bonnie: We have to feed him our blood. 
Rebekah: You're alive.
Damon: Yeah.
Rebekah: Why didn't you go with them?
Damon: Needed a siesta.
Rebekah: You gave up, didn't you?
Damon: 
Rebekah: 
Damon: Life sucks. Get a helmet.
Rebekah: 
Jeremy: Ah, come on!
Bonnie: There's got to be a way to do this without raising him. 
Vaughn: Don't listen to the witch, boy. We have to raise Silas, and we have to do it now.
Jeremy: Bonnie! 
Vaughn: What you shoulda done already. I'm gonna raise Silas...
Vaughn: You're a bit confused, Mr. Gilbert. We're on the same team here.
Jeremy: You stabbed my friend!
Vaughn: I don't mess around with witches.
Jeremy: 
Vaughn: It's what it's meant for!
Vaughn: What else would you use it for? 
Jeremy: Don't! The hunter's curse!
Elena: You okay?
Caroline: How did you get out?
Klaus: I fear something awful has befallen your friend Bonnie. 
Caroline: You've done enough.
Klaus: I've done more than enough. I've shown kindness, forgiveness, pity...because of you, Caroline. It was all for you.
Stefan: Elena. What happened?
Elena: 
Stefan: Who?
Jeremy: Elena's here now, okay? Everything's gonna be all right.
Bonnie: 
Katherine: Come on. We gotta get you up.
Jeremy: 
Katherine: Okay. I just need to make sure that you're okay first.
Jeremy: I'm fine. What are you doing?
Katherine: 
Jeremy: It'll be there after we help Bonnie. 
Katherine: God, I forgot what a brat you were.
Jeremy: 
Katherine: I'm done playing nice.
Jeremy: Katherine.
Katherine: It's been too long, little Gilbert.
Katherine: Sorry. Family reunion is gonna have to be cut short.
