Maxfield: Preliminary report, subject 62547. 
Maxfield: Indicators predict a positive response to the first bag of undiluted Augustine blood.
Maxfield: Physical strength is an unforeseen side-effect. Terminating transfusion.
Maxfield: Activating emergency procedures.
Bonnie: Hi, Mom. I know we haven't seen each other, or talked in a while...so I wanted to make you a video update. I finally finished my whirlwind summer tour, got a new 'do and, I'm in college at Whitmore, where Grams taught. And this is my dorm! It's huge, right? It even has a fireplace! I mean, what dorm has a fireplace?
Bonnie: Oh, here they are. Hey, guys! Say hi to my mom! 
: "By the way, Mom, I'm not a witch anymore, because I died and then came back from the Other Side."
Caroline: "Yeah, I'm this supernatural anchor that connects the two worlds together, so..."
Elena: "Technically, I'm a ghost, that people can still see, and touch, so..."
Bonnie: Okay, so I left out a detail...or two. I'll explain when she visits. How big is this party going to be?
Elena: Well, let's see. Silas and Tessa are gone, and you finally aren't.
Caroline: Which equals a massive cause for celebration!
Elena: Which equals a massive party. Hopefully. I mean, since each of us have only made one friend in college so far.
Caroline: And given that mine went radio silent after he kissed me, and yours was last seen at a tea party for a vampire-hating secret society.
Bonnie: Hmm...Augustine, right? The one who covered up your roommate's death and wants you kicked off from campus.
Bonnie: What? I've kept up! The Other Side is boring. What else am I supposed to do?
Elena: All right. So, Augustine wants us gone. Who cares? It doesn't matter. It's not gonna happen. We're moving on with our lives, together, as functional vampires,—
Caroline: With Jell-O shots.
Bonnie: 
Bonnie: What??
: Nothing.
Elena: 
Bonnie: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
: Wait? Registering for classes?
: I know. I-- She's-- I know I have Elena's blessing. I still don't need to rub it in her face the first day in the triple dorm room.
Jeremy: We could always sneak back to my place.
Bonnie: You mean, Damon's house? 
: This hair, by the way, kind of hot.
Jeremy: You okay?
Bonnie: Yep. Gotta go to class. See you tonight?
Jeremy: Yep. 
woman: I'm ready.
Elena: Okay. I know this is going to sound lame, but--
Damon: Anytime you start with "This is gonna sound lame," guess what? It is!
Elena: This is for Bonnie, and you had a really big part in bringing her back, so, I think you should come. 
: Hey! Aaron, hey!
Aaron: Hi.
Elena: Long time, no see. Hey. 
: Who's Aaron?
: Party in a dorm. No, thanks.
Elena: I know what you're doing. You like to push people away, but the thing is--
: How do you know that about me?
: Because you told me at the costume ball 
Elena: Forget I said that, forget that I know anything. We're starting over. You're coming to my party. There will be free beer, and it will be really good for you.
Aaron: See you then.
Elena: See you tonight!
Damon: Well, that was an embarrassingly close call. Maybe I should be there so you don't spill all of our secrets and make out with a moody mystery guy.
Elena: The only moody mystery guy that I want to make out with is you. Oh, and speaking of which, invite Stefan.
Damon: Speaking of moody, or making out? Either way, he'll never show. His memory is back, and he remembers he hates us.
Elena: Just try, okay? I bought bourbon, so he can just get drunk and hate us from afar.
Damon: Well, I'll be sure to relay the message.
: So apparently, we've been invited to a college party. 
Damon: Stefan? 
Stefan: Yeah, I'm fine.
: How about my favorite reading chair?
: Just tell Elena thanks, but I'm not really up for a party tonight. 
Katherine: 
Matt: No! You're drunk and scaring the customers.
Katherine: You realize that every single time you say no, it just makes you hotter, right?
: What are you watching, some Czech reality show?
: How'd you know it was Czech?
Katherine: Eye contact. We're getting started.
Matt: You translate, you drink.
Katherine: Okay. What the hell am I looking at here?
Matt: So, over the summer, I went to Prague, met a girl. She followed me back here. Then, her boyfriend put some kind of spirit thing in my head.
Katherine: Oh, dear. This is bad.
Matt: Why?
Katherine: Some guy named Kristof, he, um-- he activated you.
Matt: What do you mean "activated" me?
Katherine: He's a Traveler. Travelers are a faction of witches. They're big on spirit possession. You've got one inside of you. It's kind of like a human parasite that's hitching a ride in your brain.
Matt: So how the hell do I get it out of me?
Katherine: That girl, the one that followed you back from Prague, was she, um, I don't know, feisty, a little accent, ridiculously beautiful?
Matt: 
Matt: What? You know her?
Katherine: You could say that.
: I...uh...handed out all of the flyers. Oh, and Damon said he was going to try to bring Stefan.
Caroline: Funny. That sentiment implies that Damon is actually coming.
: Hmm. Maybe a call from a mysteriously hot biology TA will help?
: Well look who rose from the dead.
Jesse: I need your help.
Caroline: What happened, Jesse?
Jesse: Just come to my room, please.
Caroline: Okay...I'm coming, but what's going on?
Jesse: It's a long story. My roomate's going to be home.
Aaron: Jesse! 
Jesse: I'm sorry, man.
: Oh, my God!
: Who the hell turned you into a vampire?
Jesse: It was torture. I was in a cell all day at at night, he would take me out and do experiments on me.
Caroline: What kind of experiments?
Jesse: I don't know. He would starve me and then inject me with some weird blood. What am I supposed to tell my parents? They left me all of these messages. They're wondering where the hell I am.
Caroline: You're going to call them and  tell them that you lost your phone, but you're okay. Where's Wes now?
Jesse: I locked him in his lab after I attacked him. Honestly, the whole escape was kind of a blur. I wasn't exactly in my right mind.
Caroline: Well, you're new and you're hungry.
Elena: Not for long. I brought our stash.
Elena: How are you doing?
Jesse: Our stash? You're a vampire too?
Elena: You say it like it's a bad thing. First rule of being a vampire is realizing how awesome you are.
: How's he doing?
Caroline: He's alright. He's alive.
Caroline: Elena, wait. I was thinking that Jesse could do it. 
Jesse: Holy crap. That is insane.
: You want to teach him about compulsion? 
Katherine: Hey stranger! 
Stefan: Knock yourself out.
Katherine: Hey! Come on! Please. Just have one drink with me? Please. Stefan, I've had a bad...
Stefan: One pity drink.
Katherine: See? The universe at work. I don't know if you know this, but our doppelgänger stars are fated to be together. So, like it or not, you're going to end up with someone who looks like me. Although, the universe seems to have all of its eggs in the Elena basket; but at this point, I don't really blame it. 
Stefan: What is wrong with you?
Katherine: Other than the joint pain, the receding gums, and the fact that I have to pee every five minutes, I'm dandy. But hey! Enough about me. Why are you all by your lonesome?
Stefan: So I could avoid talking to anyone.
: Well, if you did want to talk to someone, I'm right here. And, uhh, let's be honest, I'm wasted, so I'm not going to remember.
Stefan: Look, I thought that killing Silas would allow me to move on with my life, but I was wrong.  I spent my summer locked in a safe. One minute, I think I'm fine, and the next, I feel like I'm dying all over again.
Katherine: Oooohh. Classic PTSD. You survived a pretty traumatic event, and now you're back, and you've got nothing but free time to just relive that terrible experience in the safe. Well, allow me to give your life purpose. Help me with one little favor?
Stefan: Should've known this was gonna come around to you needing something from me.
Katherine: I'm just trying to help. What would I know about post-traumatic stress? I only had my newborn ripped from my arms by my judgmental father. Then, I had to run five hundred years after my entire family had been slaughtered by a psychopath, but hey! That didn't have any lingering side-effects.
Stefan: Okay. Okay. All right.  What do you need?
Nadia: I thought you never wanted to see me again? Why did you call me?
Katherine: Stefan, I'd like you to meet Nadia Petrova, my daughter.
Jesse: So, your mom's like me too?
Bonnie: Yeah, yeah. Long story. She's, uh, surviving fine. You'll be great.
Jesse: Your eyes keep scanning the room. You afraid I'm going to go vampire postal on the fourth-floor freshmen?
Bonnie: No. I'm sorry. I'm just looking for my-- I'm not sure what he is, actually.
Jesse: Boyfriend? Friend with benefits?
Bonnie: He's my best friend's little brother. He's still in high school and I-- I think I'm madly in love with him!
Elena: You been keeping an eye on Jesse?
Caroline: Yep. I've been teaching him the art of sublimating vampire hunger via grain alcohol.
Elena: And I sent Damon to question Wes.
Caroline: You realize that Damon's going to kill Wes, right?
Elena: He's not going to kill him. He's getting information.
Caroline: You realize you're wrong, right?
Elena: Okay. Look. I know you're not crazy about Damon and I being together--
Caroline: No. No. It's fine.  I'm fine with you two being together, as long as you can acknowledge the kind of person you are with.
Maxfield: What do you want?
Damon: What I want is to be drinking copious quantities of booze and making out with my girlfriend, but unfortunately, I can't do that until I get a bunch of answers out of you. 
Maxfield: Careful with those!
Damon: These? 
Maxfield: M.D. PhD. I'm a researcher.
Damon: That explains it. I know a lot of people like you. Science over medicine, right? Let me guess. You use these 
Damon: Not in the mood to talk? Fair enough.
Damon: We're going to play a little game, where I inject you with whatever the hell "necrotizing fasciitis" is.
Maxfield: It's a flesh-eating bacteria.
Damon: Gross. So, I'm going to do that and I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions, and if you answer me correctly, I'm going to give you some of my delicious vampire blood and we'll heal you on up. If you don't answer me correctly, we're just gonna have to see how much flesh these little guys can eat.
Stefan: Just out of morbid curiosity, which one of you is younger?
: I am.
Stefan: Right.
Matt: Okay. So here's the knife the Traveler left behind with me. Now, what are we doing in here?
Katherine: Take a seat, Matt.
Nadia: This is ridiculous.
Nadia: Vyjde. 
Stefan: What the hell was that?
Katherine: She's calling on Matt's passenger.
Gregor: 
Nadia: 
Stefan: Easy. Easy.
Katherine: Hello, Gregor. I'm Nadia's mother. It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Gregor: What do you want?
Katherine: Here's the thing. Nadia is my only child. So naturally, I'm suspicious of anyone who wants to date her. Why don't you tell us the real reason why you're in Mystic Falls?
Gregor: To track and kill Silas.
Katherine: Hmmm. So, it has absolutely nothing to do with this?
Gregor: How did you get that?
Stefan: I would much rather be getting drunk right now, so why don't you stop wasting our time, and tell us what you're doing here?
Gregor: Fine. After Silas was dead, I was meant to kill her. 
Katherine: I didn't see that one coming.
Nadia: You were using me to get to her? Why? Why would you kill her?
Gregor: That's what the Travelers want. I don't question my orders.
Katherine: See why I don't want you dating my daughter? Because Travelers are ruthless, manipulative, hypocrites. I know 
Stefan: What did you just do?
Katherine: Give it a rest. Matt will be fine. Gregor, on the other hand, not so much. I just expelled his spirit. There's a reason why he wanted this knife so badly. It's the only thing that will truly kill a passenger.
Damon: Turning a kid into a vampire so you can experiment on him? Harsh. What is it about this place that turns people into mad scientists?
Maxfield: Human trials are a vital part of modern medicine.
Damon: Yeah, but don't people usually volunteer or sign waivers? Maybe get some dough for tuition?
Maxfield: Sometimes you do what's necessary for the greater good.
Damon: I'm not the greatest guy in the world, but sounds like some Mengele-level crap that you're spouting out. So I gotta ask, what is your greater good?
: Rabies. Sounds fun, doesn't it? And appropriate, given the circumstances.
Bonnie: You doing okay?
woman: Am I on the famous Other Side?
Bonnie: You are. What, um...what got you here?
woman: I died.
Bonnie: 
woman: A witch. What are you?
Bonnie: The Anchor to the Other Side. Every supernatural being that dies passes through me.
woman: That doesn't seem like it would be a lot of fun for you.
Bonnie: It's better than being dead.  I'm so sorry. That was such a stupid thing to say.
woman: It's okay, honey. Dying wasn't fun, but then you felt my pain, so I guess you know that. Sorry! But, you know what? The pain's gone now, and seeing a friendly face over here certainly doesn't hurt.
Jeremy: Sorry. Pretty much had to wrestle Elena to get her to give me these. 
Bonnie: Yeah. I think I am.
Jeremy: Good. I'm gonna need you to come with me.
Bonnie: Where are we going?
Jeremy: To register for classes.
Jesse: That feels amazing.
Caroline: That's one of the other fun side effects. Everything is heightened.
Jesse: So, that feeling never goes away?
Caroline: Nope.
Damon: Well, rabies was a bust. 
Maxfield: I wanted to turn Jesse into a new kind of vampire.
Damon: Well, that's awfully ambitious of you. 
Maxfield: I am awfully smart.
Damon: Ebola. 
Maxfield: 
Caroline: What?
Jesse: Last time I kissed you, you got all weird, and it was awkward, and--
Maxfield: If vampires don't need to feed on humans, they're no longer a threat.
Damon: I'm not buying the good doctor bit. 
Maxfield: Human blood will only satiate Jesse temporarily until he gets a taste of what he really craves.
Damon: Well, what exactly does he really crave?
Caroline: Ow! You bit me.
Caroline: Hey. You okay?
Jesse: Yeah. I just got to get out of here.
Caroline: Jesse...
Aaron: Okay. So this isn't the lamest party that I've ever been to.
Elena: Aaron, hey. You made it.
Aaron: Barely. I think I fell asleep. I just woke up.
Elena: Weird. Well, this will make it better. 
Aaron: Oh. Now I know why Wes told me to stay away from you. Cheers.
Aaron: Mmm. You're trouble.
Elena: So, hey. How do you know Wes anyway?
Aaron: He's my legal guardian.
Elena: Really?
Aaron: Mm-hmm.
Elena: What about your parents?
Aaron: Uh, dead.
Elena: Mine, too. Birth and adoptive.
Aaron: Whoa. Dark. No offense, but usually, I'm the biggest freak in the room.
Aaron: So how'd it happen?
Elena: Uh, our car went over a bridge. I lived, they didn't.
Aaron: Hmm.
Elena: You?
Aaron: I was six, and we went camping, and I woke up to the sound of my mom screaming. I went to check it out, and I saw blood everywhere. They had bite marks all over their neck.
Elena: Bite marks?
Aaron: Yeah. They said a bear got into the camp. So I shuffled around distant relatives for a while. Eventually, Wes took me in. So Wes is the closest thing to family I have left.
Elena: Wow. I think both need another Jell-o shot. I'll be right back. I'm glad that you came.
Aaron: Yeah. Me, too.
Caroline: Hey. Have you seen Jesse?
Elena: No.
Caroline: Wait. Where are you going?
Elena: To call Damon, to make sure that he doesn't kill Dr. Wes.
Katherine: There you are.
Stefan: Get away from me. 
Katherine: Stefan, you're okay. Relax.
Stefan: I can't do that. Do you understand me?
Katherine: You have two options, Stefan. You either deal with this now, or you run, but either way, it's gonna catch up to you. 
Katherine: Stefan, tell me the name of the first person that you kill...ahh...killed. Mmm. Name him.
Stefan: Gius...Giuseppe Salvatore.
Katherine: And the next? 
Stefan: Thomas Fell.
Katherine: See? You're in control, on solid ground. You're not drowning. You're not dying. Name them.
Stefan: Honoria Fell, Marianna Lockwood, Christopher Gilbert, 
Katherine: See? I told you I knew what I was doing.
Stefan: Thank you.
Nadia: You're right. Gregor is dead. Happy now?
Katherine: You deserve better, Nadia.
Nadia: Rot in hell.
Elena: Jesse feeds on...vampires?
Damon: That's what Doogie said, and apparently once he starts, he can't stop.
Elena: Hey. Um, the fact that he told you this means that he's still alive, right?
Damon: As of now.
Elena: Good. Please don't kill him, Damon. 
Damon: Okay, okay, okay. I won't kill him. Bye. 
Jesse: What the hell did you do to me?
Damon: Easy there, killer.
Jesse: Wasn't bad enough that you locked me up and poked me full of needles? Now I want to feed on the girl I like?
Maxfield: You feed on monsters, Jesse.
Damon: In case Professor Forbes forgot to tell you in your training, sweetie, I'm a lot older than you, and that means I'm a lot stronger than you.
Maxfield: Actually that's not one hundred percent accurate.
Damon: What the hell did they do to you?
Jesse: Raaaah!
Damon: Aah!
Elena: Damon! 
Damon: 
Caroline: No! No!
Caroline: No, Jesse! Jesse, come here. Hold on. Hold on. Just stay with me, please. Jesse, just stay with me, please. 
Elena: He was gonna kill Damon--
Caroline: But we promised that we would help him.
Damon: She didn't have a choice, all right? Once he had the taste of vampire blood, there was nothing stopping him. Go ask Dr. Frankenstein. I'll go deal with him. 
Elena: Caroline, I'm so sorry. I--
Caroline: Yeah. Me, too. Because the Elena that I used to know would have given Jesse a chance.
Katherine: 
Katherine: 
Stefan: What are you doing?
Katherine: I told you: You either face your problems, or you run. I chose option three.
Stefan: And what problem has you jumping off of a clock tower?
Katherine: I'm dying, Stefan. I'm dying of old age. I don't know. The cure did something to speed up the entire mortifying process.
Stefan: 
Bonnie: I'll admit it. I miss magic.
Jeremy: Step away from the candles.
Bonnie: Oh, my God. I think Jesse's dead.
Jeremy: What?
Jesse: I'm not ready. I don't want this.
Bonnie: Ahhh! Ohhhh!
Jeremy: Bonnie, what's going on? Bonnie! 
Bonnie: I'm the anchor to the Other Side, Jer. Every supernatural being that dies has to pass through me.
Jeremy: How often does that happen? 
Bonnie: I'm back, here, touching you. We knew there would be consequences. Just kiss me.
Jeremy: What?
Bonnie: Kiss me.
Bonnie: You and me. This, this is worth it. Any consequence is worth this.
Caroline: I'm sorry. I didn't mean what I said earlier. It was out of line. It just sucks, you know, cause Jesse was one of the good ones.
Elena: I know, and I wouldn't have killed him if I could have done something. He was dangerous. I need you to believe that. 
Caroline: I believe you, okay? I believe you want to celebrate the fact that we can go to school and function like regular freshmen. I get that. I want that, too, but, Elena, when are you gonna figure out that the outside world is not nearly as dangerous as the person you're inviting into your own bedroom?
Elena: 
Caroline: The day that I stop telling you is the day that we're no longer best friends, and I hope that day never comes.
Maxfield: If you're gonna do this, I'd much rather prefer a bullet through the brain.
Damon: Actually I'm gonna wait until I can compel all this out of your head.
Damon: What the hell's that? Why does this say 12144?
Maxfield: What do you care?
Damon: Because I was 21051.
Maxfield: 21051. Hang on. You were an Augustine vampire?
Damon: Augustine. I haven't heard that name in decades. Vampire lab rats, coded subject names. I thought you guys shut down 60 years ago.
Maxfield: You thought wrong.
Damon: You know how I said I wasn't gonna kill you? I lied.
Maxfield: Atomized vervain. When working with vampires, you can never be too careful. I'm sure Augustine will be thrilled to have you back.
