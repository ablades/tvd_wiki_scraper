DAMON: So, tell me-- what thoughts go through a man's mind before he decides, "I think I'll take the ones with the roosters?"
ALARIC: 
DAMON: Hang on.
DAMON: Glitter.
ALARIC: 
DAMON: When's the last time you talked to your fiancée?
ALARIC: I see word travels fast. She texted earlier today. Why?
DAMON: What time was it, and what'd she say?
ALARIC: 12:18-- "Do we need bread?"
DAMON: Well, she's not answering her phone now.
ALARIC: 
DAMON: I don't care. Get her on the horn. Stefan's being hunted again, and it's only a matter of time before Caroline's the bait that's used to lure him out.
ALARIC: Move.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: 
DAMON: Oh. Well, I guess the old ball and chain won't make it home for dinner, after all, will she?
STEFAN: Hold the gun. There you go. Now, the first thing you want to do-- bite the paper off the cartridge like this.
STEFAN: Hand me that ramrod.
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: Push it all the way down. Perfect.
BOY: How far away can it shoot?
STEFAN: Well, you see that, uh... You see that tree over there with the bark falling off?
BOY: No.
STEFAN: Pretty far, then, huh?
BOY: 
STEFAN: I don't know. Think you're old enough?
BOY: I'm eleven!
STEFAN: I was twelve when I shot my first gun...
BOY: 
STEFAN: You think so?
BOY: Yeah.
STEFAN: All right. Okay. Let's go find ourselves a deer. Come on.
STEFAN: Now, the trick is, never take your eye off the target. Got that?
STEFAN: Jacob?
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: Jacob! Jacob! Jacob!
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Hey.
CAROLINE: Who's Jacob?
STEFAN: Who?
CAROLINE: Jacob. You were yelling his name.
STEFAN: Oh, um... must have been a bad dream.
CAROLINE: Oh, probably because you're sleeping on the couch, silly. What are you doing down here?
VALERIE: That would be my fault.
VALERIE: I--I just wanted to let you know I used the last of the shampoo.
CAROLINE: Valerie, I didn't know that you were staying here.
STEFAN: Stayed. Past tense. Um, just one night.
VALERIE: 
CAROLINE: Yeah. You do that.
VALERIE: ...All right.
CAROLINE: Okay.
CAROLINE: Explain.
STEFAN: Okay. Lily wants to raise Julian from the dead. Valerie tried to scorch his body before she could get her hands on him, and that did not work out so well...
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Well, maybe you can just trust me that I know what I'm doing.
CAROLINE: So what you're saying is, Valerie needs to disappear-- new name, new job, a country in a separate hemisphere?
STEFAN: No. No.
CAROLINE: Well, you just said that she's in danger. I mean, if I need to drive her to the airport myself, I will do that.
STEFAN: Mmhmm.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: You know, I really like this form of manipulation.
VALERIE: Whatever we're doing, we should do it fast. The Phoenix Stone turns people mad, and Julian's soul's been in it for over a hundred years, so anywhere he is, I need to be as far away as possible.
JULIAN: Ha, see, Beau, fencing's got to flow--
JULIAN: Hwah!
JULIAN: Like a conversation. I speak. You listen. I speak more!
JULIAN: You've improved. Well done, friend.
LILY: Gentleman. Our backyard's not big enough?
JULIAN: Beau insisted!
JULIAN: Didn't you friend?
LILY: Take it outside, please.
JULIAN: Well, you heard this ridiculously attractive woman.
LILY: You are suspiciously cheery. Are you sure you shouldn't still be in bed?
JULIAN: My love, I need to be on my feet again. I spent the last hundred years on my back.
JULIAN: So, unless you can make an offer that I cannot refuse...
JULIAN: Mmm...
LILY: Okay. Tempting, but I have another idea.
JULIAN: And I like it already.
LILY: We have enemies here.
JULIAN: You mean Valerie.
LILY: That name is not to be uttered in this house. I am referring to my sons.
JULIAN: Your sons... are alive?
JULIAN: Okay. Well, I have some catching up to do.
LILY: My thoughts exactly.
JULIAN: Hmm...
DAMON: "Lily Salvatore requests your presence to celebrate our town's peaceful spirit and introduce a new friend. This evening, 5:00." Hmm. Looks like Mom raised her man-crush from the dead.
ALARIC: 
ALARIC: Hey...
BONNIE: 
ALARIC: 
BONNIE: Because I'm at Scull Bar, where faux-Jo is currently--
BONNIE: --Holding her laptop like it's a book. You promised me you would help her figure out who she was before she did anything crazy.
ALARIC: 
BONNIE: I know this is probably impossible for you. We have no idea what's going to happen to her. We can't just leave her unattended.
ALARIC: Well, just keep an eye on her, then.
BONNIE: 
STEFAN: Ah, going no tie? I'm going no tie.
DAMON: Not just no tie-- no going.
STEFAN: You saw her invite. Julian's back. You're going!
DAMON: To watch Lily bat her eyes at her zombie douche-brain boy-toy? Thanks, but I'd rather stay home and stub my toe repeatedly.
STEFAN: You do realize that "zombie douche-brain boy-toy" is living in your house? Bathing in your tub, eating your Froot Loops?
DAMON: 
DAMON: Mom, who convinced Kai to link Elena's life with Bonnie's so I'd be miserable for the next six-plus decades.
STEFAN: What are you getting at?
DAMON: Julian makes her happy, Stefan. More time they spend together, the happier she gets, the more tragic it'll be in six months when I hand-deliver his heart to her.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Yeah, you know, give or take. Let her get her hopes up. Let her start planning their entire eternity... and then--
DAMON: --Squish, he's dead.
STEFAN: That might he a bit of a problem, brother, because I plan on killing the bastard tonight.
CAROLINE: Seattle looks nice. Hey, they've got the Space Needle! Great coffee, Mount St. Helens...
VALERIE: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: Um, I mean, there's always Indonesia...
CAROLINE: Oh, you could rent a hut on the beach and drink out of coconuts!
VALERIE: 
CAROLINE: Lets put a pin in locations for a moment and talk names because Valerie Tulle is way too traceable.
CAROLINE: I'm thinking... Matilda. Oh, you could totally pull off Matilda!
CAROLINE: Matilda Pettigrew from Liverpool, England.
CAROLINE: What, do you want to write it down?
VALERIE: You're handling me like I'm a wounded bird, like I'm some sort of victim, but I'm not.
VALERIE: When Stefan kills Julian, he can't hurt anyone else, and I can just put this whole mess behind me.
CAROLINE: What mess?
VALERIE: You know, the whole reason I'm afraid of Julian? My big secret? The entire horror story?
VALERIE: Stefan must have told you. He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone, but I didn't know that that included you...
VALERIE: Well, his loyalty is certainly attractive, isn't it?
CAROLINE: Okay, I'm sorry-- what didn't he tell me?
VALERIE: Never mind. As you were saying, uh, Matilda Pettigrew from Liverpool, hmm? That's good. I like it.
NORA: So, you just line up those matching pieces of candy like so.
NORA: There you go! You got it. It took Mary Louise a month to pass the first level.
JULIAN: And this is meant to be, like, fun, right?
NORA: Oh, yeah! Give it another five minutes, you'll be full-on addicted.
JULIAN: I think this era suits you, Nora.
NORA: 
JULIAN: Well, I think she's just nervous to let her little birdies fly free. She doesn't want another Valerie on her hands.
NORA: 
JULIAN: No.
JULIAN: You certainly are not. Perhaps I could talk to Lily, see if I can't convince her to loosen her reins a little?
NORA: You would do that?
JULIAN: Of course.
LOUISE: There you are! Guests are arriving. Help me greet them?
NORA: You're greeting them dressed like that?
LOUISE: What's wrong with it?
JULIAN: Absolutely nothing, Mary Louise. You look stunning as always.
STEFAN: 
LILY: 
STEFAN: Thank you.
STEFAN: Compliments of the Lockwood cellar.
LILY: 
STEFAN: Ooh, where did all these people come from?
LILY: 
STEFAN: 
LILY: I wanted to show you what peace looks like. My family is civilized-- none of these people are in danger.
DAMON: What? No tie?
STEFAN: What are you doing here?
DAMON: I missed my stash!
LILY: Boys, why don't you go mingle? I'll put this away.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Mmhmm.
DAMON: Can't let you do that.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Because Lily just "rearranged the furniture," and she needs a little time to live in it, you know? Fall in love with the whole feng shui of it all.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
JULIAN: Gentlemen, welcome!
STEFAN: Hmm.
JULIAN: I'm Julian.
DAMON: I'm Damon.
JULIAN: Lily told me all about you! Of course, you were only a boy back then, and now you're, well... you.
JULIAN: Stefan! How long has it been?
STEFAN: 
JULIAN: Huh. My charm is being lost on you. You must be dreadfully sober.
JULIAN: Beau, get these men something to drink, will you?
NORA: Deputy Donovan. Welcome.
MATT: It's Matt. We lost all formalities when you and your girlfriend drained me of all my blood.
NORA: Okay, look-- the whole point of this shindig is to start over. So...
MATT: Got a better idea-- why don't you convince your family to leave Mystic Falls?
NORA: 
MATT: Why would a group of vampires hang around an abandoned town with nothing to eat?
LOUISE: What are we talking about?
NORA: Apparently, Matt is sick of us.
MATT: 
NORA: Look around. Look at all these people. They're still alive, aren't they?
LOUISE: At least 'til the dessert course.
NORA: 
NORA: Come on, let's go meet people.
BONNIE: Oh, did whatever animal they're serving for dinner get a plus-one?
ENZO: 
BONNIE: You're scoping the competition.
ENZO: 
ENZO: Since you're here-- if anyone's wondering, you're my date.
BONNIE: Sorry?
LILY: Lorenzo, I'm so glad you came.
ENZO: 
LILY: Bonnie, I know we've had a rocky past, but I hope this means you're willing to start fresh.
BONNIE: 
JULIAN: Hmm, nice break.
STEFAN: 
JULIAN: Ah, Damon, come play with us.
DAMON: 
JULIAN: 
DAMON: Wait. Has he nev--?
DAMON: Have you never heard the story about the guy that tries to kill the vampire during a game of pool?
JULIAN: Huh. Well, considering my body's been in stasis for a century, why don't you enlighten me?
DAMON: Well, there's this guy. He's about Stefan's build, maybe a wee bit bigger... little more chiseled, less height on the hair.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Right, so this vampire that he wants to kill is at least three hundred years older than him.
DAMON: And anyone and everyone with half a brain knew he was being an idiot, but he had this inexplicable obsession.
DAMON: So, he bets the vampire in a game of pool, and just as the vamp is setting up for his last shot...
JULIAN: And?
DAMON: Never got a chance.
JULIAN: Oh.
DAMON: Yeah. Another vampire comes out of nowhere and stops him. Like I said, he was being an idiot.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Thanks.
ALARIC: I see you've mastered the internet.
: One of these students showed me something called WebMD. Apparently, I have a form of retrograde amnesia. So far, I've cancelled out encephalitis and paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. Most of my characteristics fall under fugue-state Amnesia, which is rare, but then again, so is coming back from the dead...
: Which I just said way too loudly.
: What?
ALARIC: Nothing.
LAURA: Dr. Laughlin, you're back! I thought you were on sabbatical.
LAURA: Laura Homested, one of your interns at the med center last semester?
ALARIC: Oh right! You remember Laura, who you mentioned to me, right?
: Laura! My star pupil.
LAURA: Really? You gave me a "C"
LAURA: Anyway, how was your honeymoon?
: 
ALARIC: Yeah. Uh, fantastic.
LAURA: Oh. Dr. Laughlin... Y-your nose. Your nose is bleeding.
ALARIC: Oh, hey, do you mind getting me some napkins?
LAURA: 
: What the hell is wrong with me?
WOMAN: 
LILY: I hate to interrupt the party, but I just wanted to introduce my dearest love, Julian. He's just returned from... shall we say, travels abroad? My family is finally complete. My hope now is that in time, we can learn to accept each other and, together, restore this town, with its residents, to a state of peace.
LILY: Cheers.
GUESTS: Cheers!
JULIAN: Beau, can I ask you something? Lily's concerns about me weren't entirely wrong. My time away might have affected my head a bit.
JULIAN: Nothing to worry about, of course! Nut, um, there is a little something that would bring me great relief. Our dearly departed Oscar had something of mine, but it wasn't on him when he died. So, I thought perhaps it was in his automobile. Could you maybe figure out where it was sent?
JULIAN: Great.
JULIAN: We haven't met. Julian.
ENZO: Lorenzo.
JULIAN: Hmm. Those meat-and-cheese spirals were decadent. Your staff does fantastic work.
ENZO: I'll send them your compliments.
JULIAN: Hmm.
BONNIE: It's called dignity. Have some! It's free.
ENZO: Oh, what I got in return was priceless. Julian is looking for Oscar's car. I intend to find it first.
ENZO: What are you doing?
BONNIE: Lily is watching. I am fixing your tie. Making her jealous like any good date.
BONNIE: That's what you wanted, right? Make her a little jealous?
ENZO: 
ENZO: Anyway, I got what I came for. Have a nice night.
ALARIC: Her nose just started to bleed, and...
ALARIC: ...And then that started.
CAROLINE: Oh, here.
CAROLINE: Take my blood.
CAROLINE: Drink. It'll heal you.
CAROLINE: ...Or not.
ALARIC: What the hell's wrong with her?
VALERIE: Seems a vampire soul inside a human body does not a perfect match make.
: 
VALERIE: The Phoenix Stone traps vampire souls. Oscar had a vampire body, got some other vampire's soul, and he lost the plot. Jo was a human. Clearly, a basic human body is unable to contain the essence of a vampire soul. You add that together, carry the one, you're a decomposing mess.
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: 
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: Sorry... I-I had no idea.
CAROLINE: 
JULIAN: Ah, what a pretty dress!
LOUISE: Do you think? Nora didn't even notice.
JULIAN: Well, Nora needs her eyes examined.
LOUISE: 
JULIAN: 
JULIAN: Why don't you drink what you're actually craving?
LOUISE: 
JULIAN: Mmm, just as I thought.
LOUISE: 
JULIAN: You, Mary Louise, have lost your swagger! The girl I remember had spunk, vigor, danger. Rules be damned. No wonder Nora's bored.
JULIAN: Mmm. I won't tell Lily this if you won't.
NORA: Mare, did you change? You're looking very Scarlet Johanss--
CATERER: Excuse me. Can you tell me where the high school is?
BONNIE: Oh... The entire town's shut down. You haven't noticed the million signs?
CATERER: Yeah, I'm looking for the high school.
BONNIE: Yeah, I heard you the first time. Why?
CATERER: Uh, can you tell me where the high school is?
BONNIE: Who've you been talking to?
CATERER: Uh, I can't say. If my boss is looking for me, can you tell him I quit?
MATT: Uh, what was that about?
BONNIE: I don't know, but I get the impression he didn't, either. We should follow him.
BONNIE: Unless you have other plans...?
MATT: This'll only take a minute. I'll meet you at my truck.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Here I thought she slept standing up like a horse...
STEFAN: You need to help me kill him, or you need to leave.
DAMON: Do you know what this means?
STEFAN: 
DAMON: It means Mom's happy. Another couple months of this, and she'll have convinced herself it's forever, and that's when we strike, Stefan.
STEFAN: Look at your bedroom! Our house is unrecognizable. Lily needs to go, and killing Julian is the start of that.
DAMON: You know something! Look at you-- murdery, vengeful. It's very humanity-off Stefan, except your switch is intact, which means you know something. So, spit it out!
STEFAN: It's not my secret to tell, Damon.
DAMON: Oh, really?
MATT: So, Nora showed me where they keep the good stuff.
DAMON: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on-- does this bottle say "Default-Deputy?" No. No. It says, "Damon's good stuff. Do not touch."
STEFAN: 
JULIAN: UGH!
STEFAN: My brother told the story wrong.
LILY: What are you doing?!
DAMON: Ugh! Nnngh.
LILY: What did I do to make you hate me so much.
STEFAN: It's not about you.
LILY: 
LILY: Answer me! What did I do wrong?
DAMON: Well, I see Stefan's plan went swimmingly. Probably explains why your fake-guests are leaving.
LILY: Sit down. Both of you.
DAMON: Oh, well, we wouldn't want to wear out our welcome. Brother, let's hit the road.
JULIAN: Sit down, son, or I'll seat you myself.
DAMON: Okay...
JULIAN: Hmmm. Over a hundred years inside this thing. Although in this, my own custom-made hell, time is meaningless. The pain, the emptiness, the complete lack of humanity, is quite literally endless. Every day is the same. I wake up. I try to escape. But instead, I end up killing the person I love the most. Every day, over and over again, I drive a stake through your mother.
JULIAN: It's almost enough to turn even the soundest mind mad, but when you're over 475 years old, you learn a thing or two about yourself. This couldn't be real, because I would never bring harm to your mother. Hell was playing tricks on me, hmm? It was trying to break me. But no, I wouldn't let it, because I knew that if I did snap... Ooh, no, no... I wouldn't be a man. I'd be a monster.
LILY: JULIAN!
JULIAN: 
STEFAN: RAGH!
LILY: 
DAMON: Knock it off!
LILY: AHHH! Julian! Julian! Julian!
LILY: 
: 
ALARIC: It's probably best not to find out.
: A woman was wielding a sword that pierced my heart. The blade was metal... It shouldn't have been able to kill me, but it did.
ALARIC: Did you just remember this?
: 
ALARIC: Well, it's nice to meet you, Florence. I am so sorry that I put you through this.
FLORENCE: It's okay. I know you want your wife back. I'm sorry I'm not her. I wish I was. She was a lucky woman.
FLORENCE: You would have been an amazing husband.
ALARIC: 
FLORENCE: Goodbye, Ric.
MATT: 
BONNIE: He didn't actually see us... did he?
MATT: Alright, everybody. Please stand up. We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
BONNIE: It's not gonna work, Matt. Someone compelled them to be here.
COVEN: 
CAROLINE: 
ALARIC: I don't care. You choose.
COVEN: 
ALARIC: 
CAROLINE: What is that?
ALARIC: It's my wedding video... post-explosion. I've never been able to watch it past the wedding vows...
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: Quiet.
VALERIE: I recognize this chant. That Gemini kid, Kai, thought they were sending him to a prison world.
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: No, you're not listening. They weren't sending him away, Caroline. They were trying to save the next generation of Gemini twins.
VALERIE: I think your babies are still alive.
STEFAN: He's still alive, so I don't know what you're moping about.
DAMON: 
DAMON: This is why there is a hard line between good and evil, Stefan! I don't cross over into your territory. Don't cross into mine!
STEFAN: This isn't about you, Damon. Get over it.
DAMON: You know, I never thought I'd say this, Stefan, but I miss the days when you just let your big brother handle all the dirty work. Quite frankly, I can't figure out why you have such a big beef with this guy, unless V-card Valerie got under your skin.
STEFAN: You don't want to start with me right now, Damon.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: I got Valerie pregnant...
DAMON: What?
STEFAN: In 1863. Julian found out about it, and he beat her until the baby was no longer alive.
DAMON: Oh...
STEFAN: 
DAMON: ...Why didn't you just tell me?
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: I want him dead Damon. No one's gonna stop me from killing him. Not in six months, not in six weeks-- now.
VALERIE: Twins are the lifeblood of the Gemini Coven. If a pregnant mother is in danger, then the transfer is our magical fail-safe. It's rarely used, but used nonetheless.
CAROLINE: Ric, tell me that this isn't crazy.
ALARIC: 
ALARIC: Why the hell not?
CAROLINE: Because I don't want you to get your hopes up for something that is insane.
VALERIE: I need your blood.
VALERIE: Now, put it here.
VALERIE: Indonesia-- the farthest geographical point from Mystic Falls. Your progeny are, obviously, made up of your DNA. If they're alive, the blood will travel along the map. Once it's in the proximity of the babies, the map should ignite. Close your eyes. Clear your mind.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: May I ask you something?
STEFAN: Did Julian remind you of anyone in particular tonight?
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Elena and I talked about starting a family. I mean, it was fantasy, but still. We secretly knew as long as she was a vampire, it's all it was. Then, she took the cure, and all of a sudden, having a real family was a possibility. Granted, it'd be dysfunctional as hell, but we'd have a real human family.
STEFAN: Did it ever scare you? The thought that maybe you'd turn out like our father?
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Hmm.
DAMON: What about you?
STEFAN: Well, I've been on this earth for 160-some years, and I've seen the world at 30,000 feet. I've traveled to every continent, and learned how to cook--
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: If you want Julian dead, I'll help you. Tomorrow, tonight, now... I'm in.
LILY: What the hell happened down there? You were in a blind rage!
JULIAN: 
LILY: They were just trying to hurt me, all right?
LILY: Look, the whole point of tonight was to end this feud, not start a new one.
JULIAN: 
LILY: This version has no desire to see her children dead. If you have a problem with that... we have a problem.
JULIAN: Lily... Perhaps I'm more affected by my time away than I wanted to admit.
JULIAN: You know, I was wishing that the hell had gone away, but my mind? It's not right. I mean, the truth is, I'm frightened that I'm not the Julian that you remember.
LILY: We'll fix it.
LILY: We'll fix it together, all right? But you must promise me-- nothing like that will ever happen again.
JULIAN: Well, in the meantime... I need to feel safe. Your kids will strike again, and I need to protect myself.
LILY: What I believe you have in mind will take the cooperation of the entire family.
JULIAN: It will, but I don't anticipate that to be a problem... They love me.
VALERIE: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: Guys, stop! The spell isn't working, okay? The blood's just off the map now.
CAROLINE: See? I warned you not to get your hopes up.
CAROLINE: Oh, my God!
ALARIC: 
VALERIE: 
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: The babies. They're here!
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: They're not on the map, Caroline. They're inside of you.
