Elena: Jeremy! Oh, no. No. No. Oh, god, no. Oh god...
Damon: How'd this happen?
Stefan: It was Katherine. She must have been following us this whole time.
Damon: What about the cure, or Silas?
Stefan: If there was anything in there at all, it's all gone.
Damon: Where the hell is Bonnie?
Stefan: I have no idea. She went looking for Jeremy last night. She never came back. Damon, Elena is in there waiting for the Gilbert ring to bring Jeremy back to life.
Damon: Okay, fine. I'll wait with her.
Stefan: Damon, listen to me. Jeremy was one of the Five, a hunter.
Damon: He's supernatural. The ring won't work anymore. 
Caroline: 
Elena: Come on. Let's get him upstairs.
Stefan: Can I get you anything?
Elena: No. I'm fine. I'm just gonna sit here and wait with him until he wakes up. Let me know if you hear anything about Bonnie, okay?
Stefan: 
Damon: Unless you're a blonde, a Bennett witch, or a doppelgänger, I suggest you steer clear.
Rebekah: Where is it? The cure? I know someone has it.
Damon: Yeah, someone - Katherine.
Rebekah: Katherine? The doppelgänger?
Damon: Yeah. Sneaky little bitch must've been spying on us for weeks. She killed Jeremy...or somebody did. 
Rebekah: I didn't say I was going to miss him, but I'm not heartless. He was Elena's only family.
Damon: Good. Well, you can send flowers after you help me find Bonnie. 
Rebekah: We need to find Katherine.
Damon: If there's one thing that's a guarantee in this miserable little world, it's that Katherine Pierce is gone. We need to find Bonnie. Oh, and beware of the immortal Silas. If he was asleep in that cave, he's awake now.
Shane: 
Bonnie: How are you healed?
Shane: It was Silas. He helped me. You did it, Bonnie. He's risen. 
Bonnie: Get away from me.
Shane: I know you're angry with me, okay? But now you'll see everything I did, all those lives lost, they weren't in vain. Silas is gonna bring them back.
Bonnie: What you want to do isn't natural, Shane. You can't bring back the dead.
Shane: I think you'll change your mind now.
Bonnie: What do you mean, "now"?
Shane: When Silas awoke, he had to feed to gain his strength. He'd been desiccating for almost 2,000 years. He needed blood. Jeremy was there.
Bonnie: What are you saying?
Shane: He...
Bonnie: 
Shane: He drained him of his blood, Bonnie. Jeremy is dead.
Caroline: How long has she been like that?
Stefan: Ever since we found his body. She hasn't said anything except that she's waiting for him to wake up.
Caroline: But he's not going to wake up. She knows that, right?
Stefan: Look. Deep down, I think she has to, but we're talking about Elena here. She feels grief more powerfully than anyone else. I think her denial is the one thing protecting her from letting it all in.
Caroline: But she can't stay like that forever.
Stefan: I know, but I don't want to be the one to break her out of it, not until we know that Bonnie is safe, not until we get Damon over here to, you know--
Caroline: Use the sire bond to convince her that everything is okay?
Elena: I'm not in denial. 
Caroline: Elena--
Elena: It's possible, Caroline. There's a chance. It may be miniscule, but it's hope and I'm gonna hold on to that hope with everything that I've got because there's no way that m-- 
Caroline: Hey. I know that I'm not supposed to be calling, but something happened, and I need to talk to you, Tyler. So please call me. 
Stefan: 
Caroline: As far away from Klaus as he can get. Klaus said he wouldn't stop until he found him.
Stefan: Well, Katherine's been running from Klaus for 500 years. It's not easy, but it's possible. It's probably why she stole the cure. She wants to bargain for her freedom.
Caroline: I just can't believe after all that, the cure is just gone.
Stefan: Yeah. I mean, talk about denial. In my head, I was thinking there was no way Elena was gonna stay a vampire forever...And now without any family.
Caroline: Well, we can't think about that right now. We need to make plans, lists. We need a funeral or a cover story, or a funeral and a cover story. I should go tell my mom. I guess she'll know what to do.
Stefan: We should get Matt over here.
Caroline: You're right. I will do that. I will call Matt, and then I will go tell my mom, and then I will make a list or a casserole or-- I don't know-- whatever people are supposed to do or make in these situations. 
Stefan: It's his body. He's starting to decompose. Tell your mom to get Dr. Fell over here.
Rebekah: Do you think Bonnie is dead?
Damon: Never thought I'd say this, but I hope not.
Rebekah: I don't like being out in the open like this.
Damon: What, afraid of the big, bad Silas?
Rebekah: No.
Damon: 
Rebekah: I'm not a scaredy cat. My brother Kol drove himself mad worrying about Silas rising. It would benefit us all to be a bit concerned, and you're one to talk about being afraid. You're so scared, you're 1,200 miles away from where you're supposed to be.
Damon: Hey, somebody needed to find Bonnie.
Rebekah: Stefan could've done that. Aren't you Elena's current love? It's so hard to keep track these days. Shouldn't you be home comforting her, or are you terrified of being there when she realizes her brother is dead?
Rebekah: Ow!
Damon: Sorry. Better you than me.
Damon: Mm, just the guy I wanted to see. Not really.
Shane: Bonnie, here. Drink this. It'll calm you down.
Bonnie: 
Shane: Bonnie--
Bonnie: 
Shane: Bonnie, be careful. Don't let your magic get out of control. 
Meredith: Elena?
Elena: Meredith? What are you doing here?
Meredith: I came to check on your brother. May I?
Elena: 
Meredith: 
Elena: No.
Meredith: If he's left unattended to, soon he'll start to bloat. Within a few hours, his skin will discolor, and--
Elena: No. He's-- Stop, okay? 
Meredith: I need you to release the body to me. We'll get him to a funeral home and prepare him for a viewing where you and his friends can say goodbye to him.
Elena: He's not dead, okay?
Stefan: 
Elena: 
Matt: 
Elena: No. No. No, Matt. It's fine. 
Elena: You're not dosing me again, are you?
Matt: Poison your best friend once, and suspicion follows you forever. 
Elena: We lost Bonnie on the island. Damon stayed back to try and find her.
Matt: That's funny. Doesn't he hate her?
Elena: He doesn't hate her. I think he actually kind of loves her. You're mean to the people that you care about.
Matt: That's some messed-up logic.
Elena: Damon logic.
Matt: 
Elena: I can't leave Jeremy.
Matt: Elena...There's nothing you can do right now, okay? Stefan can stay here with him. Come with me. 
Damon: Here's the thing. I was completely willing to accept the fact that you were one man on a lonely mission to kill ol' Silas, and then I got boned by my vixen nemesis Miss Katherine Pierce, and then I start thinking there's no way that this is a coincidence. So what do you know, huh? 
Rebekah: Sorry. I had to dig the arrow out of my spine. Thank you for that.
Damon: Well, if you want a lead on Katherine Pierce, here's your guy. 
Vaughn: Torture me all you want. 
Damon: It'll be worth it.
Rebekah: He's right. You can't kill him, but that doesn't mean we can't tear him apart piece by piece, nerve by nerve until the pain is so severe, that your brain shuts it off to give you one tiny moment of blessed relief, and then we'll heal you and do it again and again and again.
Damon: You are creepy.
Rebekah: Thank you.
Vaughn: 
Rebekah: How?
Vaughn: Oh, she had someone on the inside, some werewolf girl, friends with your professor.
Damon: Hayley, Tyler Lockwood's old friend. Ah, I knew she was shady. Where'd Katherine find her?
Vaughn: New Orleans. That's all I know.
Damon: 
Rebekah: We've got a lead on the cure, Damon. I'm gonna find it, but I suppose you don't mind. You never wanted Elena to be human again, anyway.
Damon: I wanted that cure for her because it's what she wanted. You might think I'm afraid to go back, but I'm not because I know what she needs. She needs me to bring her best friend home.
Shane: We got to get you home if you're gonna help Silas raise the dead.
Bonnie: I don't understand what I can do.
Shane: Well, Silas can't do magic. He was a witch, but after he became immortal, that ended. He can be a witch or a vampire, but never both. That's why I've been teaching you Expression, so you can do his work for him.
Bonnie: What? How?
Shane: 
Bonnie: Three? 
Shane: No. I've had 24 people killed-- 12 humans at the Young farm, 12 hybrids. You and I are gonna complete the triangle.
Bonnie: We're what?
Shane: Look, there needs to be another massacre, but it's okay. They're gonna come back. It's worth it.
Bonnie: 
Shane: 
Bonnie: 
Jeremy: Bonnie?
Bonnie: Jeremy?
Jeremy: It hurts.
Bonnie: Jeremy.
Jeremy: Help me.
Bonnie: I can help you. I'll help you. I can help you. 
Bonnie: No. 
Shane: 
Bonnie: 
Meredith: I'm bumping the A/C. We're not gonna be able to leave him in there for much longer.
Stefan: Yeah, I know. 
Meredith: No. No, it never does. 
Stefan: 
Damon: 
Stefan: 
Damon: 
Stefan: 
Damon: 
Bonnie: 
Elena: You brought me to the stoner pit?
Matt: 
Elena: Vicki.
Matt: Remember when Jer was so into my sister?
Elena: 
Matt: I found this after Vick died. It made me smile...and this.
Elena: Jeremy and Vicki. Did he do that?
Matt: 
Elena: Is that really what you believe?
Matt: 
Elena: If I compelled you to tell me the truth, is that what you would say?
Matt: I would tell you that it's okay to have hope...because sometimes that's all that keeps me going.
Elena: 
Elena: 
Stefan: 
Elena: Thank god. Is she okay?
Stefan: Yeah, he said she's fine. Listen, Elena. You might have been right. There might be something.
Elena: She knows what to do, doesn't she?
Stefan: Let's just see what she says when she gets home, okay?
Elena: Okay. We'll be home soon.
Vaughn: You know, if you're smart, you'll use the cure to kill Silas.
Rebekah: Killing Silas is your supernatural destiny, not mine. 
Vaughn: All right, okay. Well, you be careful up there, you know, 'cause he's up there, running about.
Rebekah: 
Vaughn: You don't believe me? Check my pack.
Vaughn: I found it in the chamber where he lay. They say no one has seen him. No one knows his face. How do you hide from the devil when you don't know what he looks like? Who knows? Maybe I'm him. 
Vaughn: 
Caroline: Tyler, it's me again. So I was thinking about it, and you probably ditched your phone, which is the smartest thing that you could do. So I don't know when you're gonna get this, but things were looking kind of bleak for a minute, and-- I don't know-- maybe they're starting to turn around. So when you get this, call me back, and I'll tell you everything.
Caroline: 
Bonnie: I'm okay.
Damon: Could you get Stefan out here?
Caroline: They said that she knows what to do.
Damon: 
Caroline: What's wrong?
Bonnie: 
Shane: 
Bonnie: It's called an Expression triangle. I need to complete it for Silas.
Matt: 
Damon: She's out of her mind, Stefan. The nutty professor's got her totally brainwashed.
Matt: Bonnie, you can't kill 12 people.
Bonnie: I know it sounds crazy, but it's the only way to get enough power.
Caroline: To do what?
Shane: When Silas was buried by the witch Qetsiyah, she left him with the cure and two choices-- stay immortal and rot or take the cure and eventually die in there of old age.
Bonnie: He's been trapped in there for 2000 years. At some point wouldn't death by old age have been...better?
Shane: No because, you see, Qetsiyah had already one-upped him. She knew that he wanted to die so that he could find peace, be reunited with his one true love. So she created the Other Side as a purgatory for all supernatural beings, ensuring that if he died, he'd end up there forever. That's where you come in.
Bonnie: Why me?
Shane: Because you, as Qetsiyah's descendant, can make the Other Side go away.
Bonnie: How?
Damon: I mean, the whole flight back home, all she could talk about was how she's the one that can drop the veil between this side and the Other Side.
Stefan: Drop the veil? What does that even mean?
Damon: What it means is, the myth about Silas being able to raise the dead is not just one, or some. It's every supernatural being over there.
Bonnie: Once the veil is dropped, the Other Side doesn't exist anymore. There's nothing separating us. We're all just one.
Damon: Three massacres, three hot spots, and the witch spell of the century, and every supernatural being over there is back with a vengeance.
Bonnie: I can't do that.
Shane: What? Oh no. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. All the witches, your ancestors who've been persecuted throughout time, your grams, Jeremy, they'll all be back. You can do this. 
Caroline: Bonnie, you are talking like a crazy person. You are not killing 12 people, and you sure as hell can't invite every monster who has ever died back into this world.
Matt: Caroline, I think she knows that.
Bonnie: I can do it. I have the power. We can bring everyone back-- Jeremy, Alaric, Vicki.
Caroline: Bonnie, stop it. You can't just say these things.
Bonnie: It's gonna be fine...
Elena: I'll get it.
Matt: Elena, I'll get it--
Elena: I said I'll get it. 
April: 
Elena: Jeremy can't come to the phone right now. He's not-- 
Damon: 
Elena: 
Damon: Hey, talk to me. I can help you.
Elena: How? How are you gonna help me? How? 
Damon: We shouldn't--
Elena: Just carry him down, please. 
Stefan: We told Matt to take her home. We thought it'd be best.
Elena: Okay. I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way.
Caroline: Do what?
Elena: 
Caroline: Elena? Elena, you need help finding something?
Elena: 
Stefan: What are you doing?
Elena: 
Stefan: 
Elena: Why? Because you want me to not be in denial? You want me to face the truth? This is the truth, Stefan. I don't want to live here anymore. I don't want these sketches. 
Caroline: 
Elena: 
Stefan: No, no, Elena. Stop.
Elena: 
Damon: Elena, I need you to calm down.
Elena: No, no, no, I can't. I can't. I can't. I-- 
Stefan: Damon...Help her.
Elena: I-- I-- 
Damon: I can help you. I want you to let me help you. 
Elena: How?
Damon: Turn it off.
Stefan: What? No, no.
Damon: Just turn it off, and everything will go away. That's what you have to do. It's what I want you to do. Just turn it off.
Caroline: Hey, it's me. Look, I hate to leave this on your voicemail, but I think that you need to know. 
Bonnie: It's gonna be okay, Matt, you'll see. I'll bring him back.
Matt: Get some sleep, Bon. We'll talk tomorrow.
Shane: 
Bonnie: 
Shane: Oh, they're just scared. They're afraid to believe.
Bonnie: You know, I've been thinking. You said if I dropped the veil to the Other Side, that the dead'll return, but that's only for the supernatural. What about the 12 people that died on the Young farm?
Shane: They were a necessary sacrifice, for the greater good. They've passed on. They've found peace. That's all anyone wants. That's all Silas wants. We'll do this together, you and I. We are the beginning.
Rebekah: Blast it. 
Shane: 
Stefan: It was a mistake.
Damon: It wasn't, and you know it. This is the only way she's gonna survive. We'll help her, keep an eye on her. When she's ready, I'll use the sire bond to bring her back.
Stefan: Her humanity, Damon, that was all she had left.
Damon: Humanity means nothing when you don't have anyone to care about, Stefan.
Stefan: 
Damon: She lost her brother. I'm not enough, not this time.
Stefan: Listen, Damon. I know that you and I, we've been through some...bad spots lately, especially when it comes to her.
Damon: Yeah. Well...guess none of that matters anymore.
Stefan: Well I just, um...I want you to know that, um-- 
Damon: I know, Stefan. 
Damon: Elena, don't do this. We can find another cover story.
Elena: 
Stefan: Look, if you burn down the house, it'll be gone. What if one day when this is all over, you want to come home again?
Elena: I won't.
