Alaric: Elena. Ahem.
Elena: I heard something.
Jenna: That was us. I'm sorry.
Alaric: We didn't think anyone else was up.
Jenna: But here you are.
Alaric: We were just-
Alaric: Chunky Monkey?
Alaric: Well...
Jenna: I'm really really sorry.
Elena: It's okay, Jenna, don't worry about it.
Jenna: I know he's been staying over a lot. Are you --- are you sure it's okay?
Elena: Seems like things are good.
Jenna: 
Elena: Then I'm extremely okay with it.
Damon: Let's do it.
Damon: 1,2,3.
Stefan: Hey. Uh, can we talk?
Elena: Why?
Damon: We went to see Katherine.
Elena: Come on in.
Katherine: Please...come on in. There's plenty of room for all of us.
Damon: I'd rather poke my eyes out.
Katherine: Mmm, they're such pretty eyes.
Stefan: We're here for the moonstone.
Damon: Feel like tossing it over?
Katherine: Tell you what, you get your little witch to hocus pocus me out of here, you can have whatever you want.
Stefan: I thought you liked it in here. Nice and safe where Klaus can't get to you.
Katherine: I've had time to reconsider.
Damon: Meaning you're hungry.
Katherine: I'm starving, Damon. And dirty. But above all, I'm bored. 
deal: you get me out of here, you get the moonstone and I'll disappear from Mystic Falls forever.
Katherine: Let me know what you decide.
Elena: You don't believe her, do you?
Damon: No, of course not. We just want the moonstone.
Stefan: According to Rose's friend Slater, there's a way to destroy the spell that Klaus wants to break.
Damon: No spell, no doppelgänger sacrifice. Ergo, you live.
Elena: How do you destroy it?
Stefan: By releasing it from the moonstone.
Elena: How do you guys even know this is gonna work?
Damon: Cause we have a crafty witch on our side.
Elena: You discussed it with Bonnie.
Stefan: She agreed to do anything she could to help us.
Elena: It's Katherine who has the moonstone. She's not gonna give it to you.
Stefan: We're gonna get it from her.
Damon: Well, what he means to say is, we will pry it from her cold, dead hand if we have to.
Stefan: Bonnie just needs to find a way to release the seal long enough for us to get in, get the moonstone, and get out in time for her to return it.
Elena: Wow. I mean, it sounds like you guys already have it all planned out.
Damon: Yep. We're awesome.
Elena: Except for one thing. I don't want you to do it.
Stefan: What are you talking about? Elena, we don't have a choice.
Elena: What about Klaus?
Stefan: We'll find him right after we get the moonstone.
Elena: Is that before or after he kills everyone that I care about, including the two of you.
Stefan: Elena, if we can de-spell the moonstone, we can save your life.
Elena: I know. Everybody keeps saying that.
Luka: So your Grams waited until you were in high school to tell you that you're a witch?
Bonnie: Well, she brought it up before but I just thought she was drunk. 
Luka: So, then, you're like, new?
Bonnie: New-ish. I still have some growing pains.
Luka: Like?
Bonnie: Physically, it's become a lot harder. I have a bad reaction to it sometimes.
Luka: Your nose bleeds?
Bonnie: Yeah. And I pass out sometimes.
Luka: It's 'cause you're trying to do too much on your own. You need help.
Bonnie: From what?
Luka: From nature. The elements. Just things that you can draw extra power from. Have you ever channeled another witch before?
Bonnie: What is that?
Luka: Say we put our energy together. We can double our strength. I'll show you, watch. Let me see that bracelet.
Luka: Take this. Now, I want you to stand very still and concentrate.
Bonnie: I don't get it.
Luka: Okay. I know...
Bonnie: What are we doing?
Luka: We're channeling. The personal items will act as a talisman. Now concentrate.
Bonnie: What is that?
Luka: 
Jeremy: What's with that weather, huh?
Luka: It's global warming, man. I don't know. I got to go. See you later, Bonnie.
Bonnie: Bye, Luka.
Luka: Bye.
Jeremy: The guy is weird, huh?
Bonnie: No, he's not.
Jeremy: What is it?
Bonnie: It's Damon.
Rose: It's not nice to leave a girl naked so early in the morning.
Rose: Whoa. Sorry, I thought you were...
Elena: I, uh, sorry, I...
Rose: There's no one else here.
Elena: Actually, I came to talk to you.
Rose: Then I should probably get dressed.
Rose: It's a bad idea.
Elena: No, it's not. From what Stefan told me, your friend Slater obviously has more information about Klaus. You and Damon just gave up before you got it.
Rose: Because somebody blew up a coffee shop with us in it.
Elena: There's more to learn. We just have to find a way to learn it.
Rose: Why are you coming to me with this?
Elena: Because you owe me. One word from me, and Damon and Stefan could have killed you for kidnapping me.
Rose: Or maybe it's because you know that they wouldn't want you doing this. And their moonstone caper gives you a chance to sneak away.
Elena: We're having a disagreement, okay? They're willing to risk everyone that I love and I'm not.
Rose: They're just trying to protect you.
Elena: And you've proven that you couldn't care less whether I'm protected or not. So, we're back to you taking me to Slater.
Rose: What exactly do you hope to achieve by this?
Elena: How would you like to be able to walk during the daylight?
Rose: I've been a slave to shadows for 500 years, what do you think?
Elena: I think I know a witch who's willing to do whatever it takes to help, if you're willing to make a deal.
Matt: Hey man, how you doing?
Tyler: Good, you?
Matt: I'm pissed at myself for picking a fight with you. And feeling guilty for what happened to Sarah. I mean, I've been dodging you for days because I didn't know what to say to you.
Tyler: Don't worry about it, man.
Matt: I'm really sorry. Please know that.
Caroline: Matt.
Matt: Hey.
Caroline: How are you?
Matt: I -- I've been better. I gotta -- I gotta get to class.
Caroline: Okay.
Tyler: You two still on the outs?
Caroline: Looks like it. You realize there's almost a full moon?
Tyler: Vampires don't have enough problems, you want to take on mine?
Caroline: Have you even thought about it? The whole...wolf thing? Do you know what you're gonna do?
Tyler: I have a plan.
Caroline: Well...?
Tyler: Kind of private.
Caroline: I'm student council vice president, head of the prom committee, not to mention I single-handedly organized this town's clean up campaign. And you're really gonna turn down my help?
Bonnie: I might be able to lower the tomb spell long enough for you to get in there and grab the moonstone from Katherine.
Jeremy: How? It took both you and your Grams last time, and look what happened to her.
Bonnie: I'm well aware of what happened. I've learned a few new things.
Jeremy: Bonnie...
Bonnie: How will you get it?
Stefan: She hasn't been feeding. She's weaker. We're not.
Bonnie: You wouldn't be underestimating her, would you?
Damon: It's a plan. Is it perfect? 
Jeremy: Let me do it. I've got my ring. I can get in, get out, no spells necessary.
Damon: Gee, thanks, you 16-year-old child. Why didn't we think about that? Why are you even here?
Bonnie: Maybe I can help better the plan. Do you have anything that belongs to Katherine?
Rose: Slater? Slater, it's Rose. Open up!
Rose: He's not home. Sorry.
Elena: Mm-mm. No. We didn't come all the way out here for nothing.
Rose: After you.
Rose: Slater?
Rose: I don't think he's gonna be much help.
Elena: Looks like whoever blew up the coffee shop found him and killed him for his information.
Rose: Yeah, probably to stop him from helping people like us. The guy was a vampire almanac. Knowing too much information just bit him in the ass.
Elena: What are you...?
Rose: Tempered glass. U.V. rays can't penetrate.
Rose: I used to just come here and watch the day.
Elena: I'm sorry about Slater.
Rose: Any luck?
Elena: Um...It's password protected. I can't get in.
Rose: No, this is fine. Let's just go.
Rose: Stay here.
Rose: Alice?
Alice: Rose!
Alice: He's dead!
Stefan: This belonged to Katherine. Found it with her things after I thought she was dead, but it was hers.
Damon: What will this do?
Bonnie: I can turn the metal into ash. Blow the ashes on her, and it'll incapacitate her for a minute or two. Long enough for you to get the stone and get out.
Tyler: Matt's bumming pretty hard.
Caroline: I know. It's better this way.
Tyler: I get it.
Caroline: You do?
Tyler: Yeah. You can't be honest with him.
Tyler: It's not really fair to be with someone and not really let them know who you are. I get it.
Tyler: Right over here. There's a cellar that goes to our old property.
Caroline: I know.
Tyler: You do?
Caroline: I know that this is the old Lockwood property.
Tyler: Watch your step.
Tyler: I'm guessing this is where Mason was headed the night he turned. It's this way.
Caroline: Did Mason tell you about this place?
Tyler: Mason bolted before I triggered the curse, but I found these.
Caroline: Whoa. They look old.
Tyler: And these bolts and chains. I need new chains, but the bolts could still hold.
Tyler: I think that's what this place was used for. Full moons.
Caroline: What's this?
Tyler: I have no idea.
Caroline: Was it Mason's?
Tyler: "August 31 -- My body is changing. I'm edgy, angry, impatient. I get so mad, I black out and forget what I say or do. I'm not myself, not since Jimmy's death. What's happening to me?"
Tyler: He chronicled everything. 
Caroline: Well, does he say what happened?
Stefan: Still gotta get the torches.
Damon: Alaric's stake gun's in my trunk. Bonnie?
Bonnie: Go ahead. I'm almost done.
Jeremy: What are you doing?
Bonnie: Shh!
Jeremy: Hey, you're not strong enough.
Bonnie: I'll be fine.
Jeremy: You could get hurt.
Bonnie: And Elena could die. I'll be fine. Promise. I promise.
Jeremy: Here, I got this okay? Go get me, um, go get me something to put this in. All right?
Rose: She found him a few minutes before we did.
Elena: How is she?
Rose: Overreacting. Big time.
Elena: Her boyfriend just died. There's no such thing as overreacting.
Rose: Those tears are for her. She didn't care about Slater. 
Alice: Thank you.
Alice: You look really familiar. Did you know Slater?
Elena: Not personally, no. I just knew that he kept detailed records of all of his vampire contacts and I was hoping that he could point me towards Klaus.
Alice: Doubtful. Klaus doesn't want to be pointed at.
Elena: Do you know Slater's computer password?
Alice: Are you seriously asking me that right now? I just saw my boyfriend with a stake through his heart.
Elena: I understand that. Do you know his password?
Alice: Who do you think you are?
Elena: What if I could convince Rose to turn you?
Elena: Will you show us his files then?
Alice: Someone's been here. The hard drive's completely wiped out.
Rose: Yeah, probably whoever killed him.
Alice: Lucky for you, Slater was paranoid. Everything's backed up on a remote server.
Rose: 
Elena: I know. She doesn't.
Alice: Kristen Stewart. God, was he obvious.
Elena: These are all leads to vampires?
Alice: Slater was obsessed. Almost as much as me.
Rose: What about that one? Cody Webber. They exchanged dozens of emails about Elijah.
Alice: I could call him.
Elena: Tell him that we're trying to send a message to Klaus. The doppelgänger is alive and she's ready to surrender.
Rose: What?!
Alice: Oh, my God, I knew I recognized you.
Elena: Get him the message, please.
Rose: What are you doing?
Elena: I'm getting Klaus' attention.
Rose: If Klaus knows that you're alive, he'll find you and he'll kill you.
Rose: Which is exactly what you wanted all along.
Elena: It's either me or my family.
Rose: So this whole charade is some suicide mission so that you could sacrifice yourself and save everyone else?
Alice: 
Katherine: The youngest Gilbert. This is an intriguing surprise.
Jeremy: I'm here for the moonstone.
Katherine: Yeah, yeah, the moonstone. It's very popular today.
Jeremy: Just give it to me.
Katherine: 
Jeremy: I kinda figured you'd say that.
Jeremy: Come on, where is it?
Bonnie: Sorry I'm late. I had to grab the grimoire from home.
Damon: Jeremy couldn't take the pressure, huh?
Bonnie: He said he'd be here.
Damon: Not a good time, Rose.
Rose: Don't be angry with me.
Damon: Why, what did you do?
Rose: You need to get to Richmond immediately.
Damon: Tell me.
Stefan: What the hell?
Bonnie: Is that the moonstone?
Katherine: I hate to interrupt, 
Jeremy: I'm sorry. I took some powder.
Katherine: Don't worry, I know that he's wearing his ring, so no matter how many times I kill him, he'll just keep coming back for more. So, I'm going to be in the back playing with my new little toy. 
Elijah: So how exactly does this spell work?
Jonas: Give me your hand.
Jonas: Place it here.
Jonas: Now, take my hand.
Jonas: Close your eyes. Relax your mind. And look for her.
Jonas: You saw her, didn't you?
Elijah: I know exactly where she is.
Stefan: Where the hell is Damon?
Bonnie: We can't wait, we have to get him out of there.
Stefan: She's fed, she has her strength back.
Bonnie: We still have what's left of the ash. 
Stefan: I don't have a choice.
Bonnie: It's gonna take me some time.
Stefan: How long?
Bonnie: I don't know, a while.
Stefan: Just get me in there as soon as you can.
Jonas: So how was school?
Luka: Riveting.
Jonas: What's wrong?
Luka: Nothing.
Mason: "It's September 15 -- 2 hours from the first full moon since I triggered the curse".
Tyler: He taped his first transformation.
Caroline: Um...There's nothing. 
Caroline: "I chose the garage. I could deadbolt the door. It was far from the street so no one could hear. I bolted hooks to the floor for the carabiners". 
Tyler: Retractable cables.
Tyler: What's he doing?
Caroline: It's....wolfsbane. 
Caroline: "I kept thinking I'd black out and not feel it. But I did. I...I felt all of it".
Caroline: How long is it?
Tyler: 
Tyler: Four hours.
Tyler: Five hours. How long does this last?
Tyler: I can't -- I can't do that. Caroline, whatever that was, I can't go through that.
Damon: What are you doing here?
Elena: What are you doing here?
Elena: You called him?
Rose: I'm sorry, Elena.
Elena: You said that you understood.
Damon: She lied.
Alice: Damon Salvatore!
Damon: 
Alice: No...Way!
Damon: Come on. We're leaving.
Elena: No.
Damon: I said we're leaving.
Elena: I'm not going with you.
Damon: You do not get to make decisions anymore.
Elena: When have I ever made a decision? You and Stefan do that for me. Now this, this is my decision.
Damon: Who's gonna save your life while you're out making decisions?
Elena: You're not listening to me, Damon. I don't want to be saved. Not if it means that Klaus is gonna kill every single person that I love.
Damon: Get your ass out the door before I throw you over my shoulder and carry you out myself.
Elena: No!
Damon: Don't ever do that again.
Katherine: Ohhh, something's happening.
Jeremy: Bonnie, no!
Jeremy: 
Katherine: Maybe she is.
Jonas: What's going on?
Luka: It's Bonnie Bennett. She's channeling me.
Jonas: Why would you let her do that?
Luka: You told me to bond with her, so I bonded.
Jonas: Oh, God.
Stefan: Bonnie....Bonnie....
Jeremy: You gotta stop her!
Stefan: You need to stop. Bonnie!
Jonas: Luka!
Stefan: Bonnie!
Stefan: Bonnie. Bonnie, wake up, please. Bonnie, wake up. Bonnie.
Katherine: Yes, please because I'm still in here!
Stefan: Are you okay? You all right?
Bonnie: It didn't work.
Bonnie: I'm not strong enough. Even with help, I can't do it.
Katherine: Ahhh, that's too bad, I'm still hungry.
Stefan: Go!
Caroline: You know what? I don't think we should read this anymore.
Tyler: Why? What did you read?
Caroline: There's a...a reason it's called a "curse", Tyler.
Tyler: "Unimaginable pain. I thought it would never end. It was the worst night of my life".
Caroline: But...he did say that the transformation speeds up over time.
Caroline: So, if you can just get through this first time, then...
Tyler: Why are you helping me?
Caroline: What do you mean?
Tyler: Why do you care? We've never been friends before.
Caroline: That's not true. I've known you my entire life, Tyler. I-
Tyler: We've never been close. Not like this.
Caroline: I don't know. You just seem like you...like you kind of need it.
Caroline: I was alone when I turned. I had no control over my body or my...urges. And...I killed somebody. I don't want that to happen to you. I don't want you to be alone.
Caroline: I gotta...
Caroline: Matt.
Matt: I know I should have called. I'm sorry.
Caroline: What are you doing here?
Matt: I don't know, but I was driving home from work and I just-I kinda found myself here.
Caroline: Well, are you okay? I-I've been worried about you.
Matt: I miss you.
Matt: Yeah.
Caroline: Matt, I...
Matt: Hey.
Tyler: Hey.
Damon: Time to go. Alice is soundly sleeping and won't remember a moment of this horribly stupid day.
Cody: We're here to meet the doppelgänger.
Elena: Thank you for coming.
Damon: 
Damon: There's nothing here for you.
Damon: 
Elijah: For centuries now.
Elijah: Who are you?
Cody: Who are you?
Elijah: I'm Elijah.
Cody: We were gonna bring her to you. For Klaus. She's the doppelgänger. I don't know how she exists, but she does. Klaus will want to see her.
Elijah: Does anyone else know that you're here?
Cody: No.
Elijah: Well, then, you have been incredibly helpful.
Elijah: Where's Luka?
Jonas: Asleep.
Elijah: Your shadow spell was successful. I was able to track that girl. However, I did have a little run in with one of the brothers that killed me.
Jonas: I assume he didn't live to tell about it.
Elijah: Actually, I spared him. He'd die before he'd let anything happen to her. They both would. She'll be kept safe.
Jonas: For now.
Elijah: Well, that's precisely what we need her to be. 
Jeremy: I'm home, okay? I don't need an escort to my room.
Bonnie: Oh, I don't know. Between here and upstairs there's still time for you to do something stupid.
Jeremy: I already feel bad. I don't need you to berate me.
Bonnie: Stefan is stuck in there, and I don't know how to get him out. What should I be doing?
Jeremy: You should admit that you never should have tried this in the first place.
Bonnie: I didn't have a choice, Jeremy!
Jeremy: Yeah, well neither did I.
Bonnie: Wha-Why did you have to get involved?
Jeremy: Because I didn't want you to get hurt.
Bonnie: Look, Jeremy....you can't feel that way about me.
Jeremy: Don't.
Bonnie: What?
Jeremy: Don't act like this is one-sided. Like...like I'm some kid that has a crush on his sister's friend. You could have died today.
Bonnie: And you almost did.
Jeremy: That was a chance I was willing to take.
Bonnie: I can't. I - I can't.
Bonnie: I'm sorry.
Jeremy: Yeah...
Elena: 
Damon: Well, your ride left you. I didn't want to leave you stranded.
Elena: She was just scared. She didn't mean to run.
Damon: Yes, she did. She's been running for 500 years.
Elena: I can't believe Elijah's alive. Why do you think he killed those two vampires and just let us go?
Damon: If I had a dollar for every time some evil vampire surprised me.
Damon: What you did today was incredibly stupid.
Elena: Actually, the only thing that was stupid was that I got caught. 
Elena: Damon, good night, okay?
Damon: What?
Jeremy: It's Stefan.
Elena: Stefan! Stefan!
Damon: Don't you dare.
Elena: Stefan's in there, Damon! How could you let this happen?
Damon: What are you talking about? I was too busy saving you from your crazy kamikaze mission.
Elena: You didn't even have to go after the moonstone in the first place!
Damon: It was the right call, Elena.
Elena: The right call? How was any of this the right call?!
Elena: Damon, let go of me! Damon, let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me!
Elena: Please.
Damon: Are you done?
Damon: Don't.
Damon: Of all the idiot plans, Stefan.
Stefan: Yeah.
Damon: I'll find a way to get you out.
Stefan: Ah, it's all right. I'll handle myself. Bonnie has the moonstone. Work with her. Try to figure out how to de-spell it.
Damon: You martyr yourself in a tomb and I get partnered with a semi-competent witch. Wonderful.
Stefan: Keep Elena away from here.
Damon: Yeah. 'Cause that'll be easy.
Stefan: Promise me. No matter what happens. You'll protect her.
Damon: Promise.
Katherine: That right there was the biggest mistake you've ever made.
