FLASH-FORWARD-- ALARIC'S HOUSE, 2016



ALARIC: Oh, damn it!




BOTH GIRLS: Is it fixed yet?

ALARIC: 
 Not yet. Sweetheart, it's past your bedtime!

BOTH GIRLS: 
 No!

ALARIC: Yes, it is! Do you want to brush your teeth?




BOTH GIRLS: No!!




ALARIC: Yeah? Well, too bad!




ALARIC: Surgery will have to resume tomorrow.




ALARIC: All right. Josie, help your sister find her PJs, okay?




ALARIC: 
 Girls?




ALARIC: Damon.

DAMON: 
 Well, aren't you adorable?




DAMON: Heh. You girls, too.




ALARIC: Stand behind daddy.

DAMON: Why so gloomy? Looks like you got everything you wanted.

ALARIC: 
 The fact that you're here means somebody died.

DAMON: No, not yet. But, if you don't do exactly as I say, that could change real fast.




DAMON: So, you gonna invite me in?

TITLE CARD & OPENING CREDITS

PRESENT DAY-- WHITMORE MEDICAL CENTER, 2013



ASSISTANT: Jeez, you're here... At five AM.

ALARIC: 
 I'm gonna need the place to myself tonight.

ASSISTANT: 
 Oh, come on, man! Don't make me an accomplice to whatever weird stuff you're doing with your wife's dead body.

ALARIC: You have no idea how weird it's gonna get.




ALARIC: Is this enough to buy some privacy?




ASSISTANT: I'm gonna throw in a free reality check-- preserved bodies still have an expiration date, and this is her last day.




ASSISTANT: She doesn't have to stay home, but she can't stay here.





DAMON: Mother, tell me you have Elena.

LILY: Let me speak to Oscar.

DAMON: No can do. I'm about to wake him up from his little vervain nap.

LILY: 
 You do realize that when you get her back, you're not actually getting her back, right? She's still in a box.

DAMON: 
 Do you think I need to be reminded of that?

LILY: And yet, you're leveraging a member of my family just to get her body closer to you. How selfish can you be?

DAMON: Spare the lecture, Mommy.

LILY: 
 Damon, if you have harmed Oscar in any way...

DAMON: 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Say goodbye to Elena. It's not my first hostage swap!




DAMON: Oscar...




DAMON: 
 Uh-oh. Oscar?




DAMON: I can smell the blood on you, buddy.




DAMON: Huh?




DAMON: You've gotta be kidding me!

WHITMORE COLLEGE



CAROLINE: Ahem.

BONNIE: I didn't want to wake you.

CAROLINE: Well, I would lose more sleep if you just snuck out without saying hi!




BONNIE: Hi!




CAROLINE: Mmm... I missed this.

BONNIE: 
 Am I gonna catch fire?

CAROLINE: No! I just can't touch vampires. Valerie basically turned my skin into vervain.

BONNIE: I'll work on unraveling the spell when I--

CAROLINE: Stop! We have so much to catch up on. Let's just go shopping for Halloween costumes and we can worry about magic later.

BONNIE: Kind of worrying about magic already. Alaric think we can reunite Jo's spirit with her body by using some sketchy Native American resurrection stone. My job is to crush his dreams in the most gentle way possible.

CAROLINE: Wow! Okay... You don't even think it'll work?

BONNIE: I don't think it should. The Other Side is gone, there's no more Gemini prison world, which means Jo's spirit... is probably at peace.

CAROLINE: 
 Our lives are weird.

BONNIE: Tell me about it.




ALARIC'S APARTMENT



STEFAN: How the hell did you let this happen?

DAMON: 
 Don't even think about blaming this on me! I'm not the one that unscrewed his heart.

STEFAN: No, you're just the one who chased him down, kidnapped him... and are still technically holding him hostage.

DAMON: To get Elena back!

STEFAN: 
 And how's that working out for you? Because from where I'm standing, she's in more danger than ever because you won't let her rest!

DAMON: 
 You spend one day with Mommy Dearest, and now you're on her side?

STEFAN: I don't have to be on her side to see what's happening here. You can't be with Elena, so you're making all your bad decisions about Elena.




DAMON: We need to get rid of this body.

STEFAN: 
 No, no, no. You need to get rid of this body!




DAMON: Ugh!

SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



ENZO: Breakkie! What are we having?

VALERIE: Mushroom omelettes.




VALERIE: Hey! They're for Oscar, not you. He's coming home today.




ENZO: I'm impressed. Especially considering how late you got home last night.




VALERIE: Where's Oscar?

LILY: I don't know. Damon never showed up. I suppose I've taken the notion of trust for granted lately.




LILY: Lorenzo, would you mind terribly if I had a moment alone with Valerie?




ENZO: Is something wrong?

LILY: 
 Just some family business.




LILY: I spent yesterday with Stefan. Learned all about your little tryst in 1863.




VALERIE: 
 We were children. It was... It was puppy love! It meant nothing.

LILY: 
 Hmm. Right. That explains why you held onto his journal all these years.

VALERIE: 
 You were fragile at the time. I didn't want to upset you.

LILY: You told him you were coming back for him, and he believed you. Why put him through that?

VALERIE: 
 I was a foolish human back then. I'm sorry.




LILY: I will only say this once. If you have anything to tell me-- anything at all-- now is the time.

VALERIE: 
 I have nothing to hide.




VALERIE: I should go look for Oscar.

LILY: That won't be necessary.

WHITMORE COLLEGE / ALARIC'S APARTMENT



NORA: God, it feels good to come out of that deserted town and be around living, breathing humans we can eat! Mystic Falls is the prison world all over again.




MARY LOUISE: We're on a mission, Nora. Not a vacation.





DAMON: All right...




MARY LOUISE: Damon? I know you're in here. Open up!




MARY LOUISE: Damon, open the--




DAMON: Hello.




DAMON: Oh. Hello.




MARY LOUISE: University housing. How lovely.

NORA: 
 How sad.

MARY LOUISE: 
 Not as sad as being exiled here by your own mother. Lily must have had the wrong address for the hostage exchange. Where's Oscar?

DAMON: 
 You just missed him.

MARY LOUISE: 
 You reek of blood.

DAMON: 
 Well, I've been... I've been binge-ing.

STEFAN: And I've been judging.

DAMON: Yeah.




STEFAN: Not gonna find him in there.




DAMON: 
 Ughhh. Look, I get it. Okay? You got me--




DAMON: Oscar turned the tables, and he knocked me out, and he took off. I lost my one and only bargaining chip.

MARY LOUISE: 
 Then why isn't Oscar answering his phone?




DAMON: 
 I mean, the guy doesn't want to be found!




NORA: 
 Why don't I believe you?

MARY LOUISE: 
 Well, this is pointless. Come, Nora.




DAMON: 
 I'll throw that away for you.




STEFAN: Hey!





DAMON: Screw it. Let's just get this guy to the furnace.




DAMON: 
 Uh, wrong... door... darling.




STEFAN: Hmmm. 'Kay.




STEFAN: "A message from Miss Nora Hildegard, dictated but not read. For every hour that Oscar isn't returned, a Whitmore student will die... Starting now."




DAMON: No!




DOWNTOWN MYSTIC FALLS



TOUR GUIDE: With dozens of disappearances and a history of animal attacks, Mystic Falls was the subject of supernatural speculation even before the quote-unquote "mining fire evacuation."




TOUR GUIDE: We're not doing anything illegal, Officer.

MATT: Besides violating a town-wide quarantine and putting these people's lives at risk to make a quick buck? Pack it up and get out of here.

TOUR GUIDE: 
 We both know there's no real danger here! It's just an empty ghost town!




ENZO: Really? You hear about the noises in the old boarding house? The mysterious figure haunting the clock tower? Tell your ghostbusters to charge up their proton packs-- they've hit the proverbial jackpot!




MATT: Get out of here, unless you want your license suspended. Now.




TOUR GUIDE: Come on. Let's go.




MATT: If you touch any of these people, I will shoot you right here.

ENZO: 
 Don't waste the ammunition, mate. Waste of taxpayer money! And I am one of your last taxpayers.

MATT: 
 What do you want, Enzo?

ENZO: 
 Oh, God. Just a good night's rest... Which is proving difficult lately, with all the late-night sneaking in and out of the Salvatore house. Vamp-hearing's bad enough, but once the Heretics start creeping, that's when I really lose sleep.

MATT: 
 There's an abandoned music shop down the way. I'll let you steal a tiny fiddle!

ENZO: 
 Or, you could grant me access to the town surveillance system. I have a Heretic to track.

WHITMORE COLLEGE



CAROLINE: Hi.

STEFAN: Hi! Brought you coffee.




CAROLINE: Oh, and he keeps getting better!




CAROLINE: 
 Sorry!

STEFAN: 
 Ah, it's okay. No contact. It's not your fault.

CAROLINE: I take it your charm didn't work on getting Valerie to undo the spell?

STEFAN: 
 Uh, I haven't spoken to her yet...

CAROLINE: 
 Oh. So you're avoiding?

STEFAN: No. There's nothing to avoid.

CAROLINE: 
 Well, Stefan, she was your first love, and then she just left you hanging. You're not the least bit curious why?

STEFAN: 
 She hasn't contacted me in the four months she's been back, so I'm assuming she's as over it as I am.

CAROLINE: Yeah, but that is quite an assumption, considering that she's the reason why I literally can't touch you.

STEFAN: 
 Unfortunately, she's the Heretic that I am the least concerned about right now.

CAROLINE: 
 Oh, God! Who now?

STEFAN: Let's just say that it involves two bored mean-girls on a campus full of easy targets. But, I have come up with a genius plan to keep them occupied while Damon sorts out his Oscar problem.




CAROLINE: The dance?

STEFAN: Mmhmm.

CAROLINE: 
 Full of potential victims...?

STEFAN: And distractions! All in one place. Easy to babysit. I think the hardest part will be feigning enthusiasm.




CAROLINE: Yeah, they'll never fall for it... Unless they think it's their idea?







NORA: I'm getting hungry. Is it death-o'clock yet?




MARY LOUISE: We still have thirteen minutes.




NORA: What's this?




CAROLINE: Oh, nothing. It's just some silly "Heaven and Hell" ball. Stefan invited me, but I don't know. These days, Halloween just seems like an excuse to get drunk and show skin...




CAROLINE: Sorry. No Heretics allowed. Halloween's only for people who dress up as psychopaths!

MARY LOUISE: 
 As if we'd want to drink cheap beer out of plastic and then brag about it all over the internet.




NORA: As if you'd even know how to do that. We're going!

CAROLINE: 
 To a college party?




CAROLINE: Oh, okay! Okay, good luck with that.

NORA: 
 What's that supposed to mean?

CAROLINE: Nothing! No, you two will fit in just fine. Seriously, you guys have nothing to feel self-conscious about.




MARY LOUISE: Did I say you could leave?




CAROLINE: What do you want?





CAROLINE: I see you found a dress... from my closet.




MARY LOUISE: I haven't been to a party since New Year's 1902. Be honest-- will I make a proper modern devil?

CAROLINE: 
 Shouldn't be too much of a stretch...




CAROLINE: ...Unlike the hips of that dress.




MARY LOUISE: Would you prefer I chose a different one and dyed it with your blood?




CAROLINE: Look, I gave you an outfit. Now, it's your turn. Siphon off this annoying anti-vampire spell.

MARY LOUISE: 
 Aw, are you prohibited from showing physical affection for your significant other? Try being gay in 1900.

CAROLINE: What do you care about some silly spell? You don't even like Valerie.




MARY LOUISE: You're right. I don't. I've had to endure two lifetimes with that conniving shrew, and I've learned that when it comes to Val? You don't get on her bad side.





NORA: Not happening, Stefan. Look, if I siphon Caroline's spell, Valerie will find out, and she'll retaliate with something much worse. The girl is a rancid bitch.

STEFAN: That's not the Valerie that I knew.

NORA: 
 Well, I used to be a sickly, abused little urchin cast out by my coven, and then I met Mary Louise. Love changes people. I mean, maybe Valerie's obsession with you is the reason why she's a walking funeral dirge.




MARY LOUISE: 
 Oh, Nora!




MARY LOUISE: Well?




NORA: Hmmm. Not bad!

MARY LOUISE: 
 Not bad is not good.

NORA: No, you look nice! It's just... kind of plain. But, I can sex it up for you.

MARY LOUISE: 
 I'm comfortable like this, Nora. Don't!




MARY LOUISE: Stop it!

NORA: 
 Oh, come on. You're supposed to be a devil!

MARY LOUISE: 
 You want a devil?




MARY LOUISE: It's fifteen minutes past the hour. Distraction period over.




NORA: 
 Mary Lou! Wait!




WHITMORE MEDICAL CENTER



ALARIC: 
 Well, what better way to spend Halloween, huh?





BONNIE: 
 Well, why would I want to go to some stupid Halloween party like a normal student? Maybe meet a nice guy, or not-so-nice guy, have a fun, drunk Halloween hook-up when I can be here, struggling to raise the dead?




ALARIC: Well, if it makes any difference, this is worth some serious extra credit.

BONNIE: 
 You think? Whether or not I'm capable, you're lucky I'm willing.




BONNIE: And the visions from that stone scare the hell out of me, so... Don't. Rush. Me.




DAMON: 
 Well, that's too bad, because we gotta bring this guy back to life... Now.




HEAVEN AND HELL BALL



STEFAN: 
 Nice costume for two hours notice!

CAROLINE: 
 Oh, thank you.

STEFAN: You weren't... Oh, I don't know... Already coming to this and just, uh, forgot to invite me?




CAROLINE: I didn't forget to invite you. I just felt like a Halloween party wasn't great first-date material.

STEFAN: 
 So then this isn't our first date?

CAROLINE: 
 Well, it depends... What do you think it is?

STEFAN: 
 Torture.




STEFAN: Oh, they're here. Guess it's time to babysit.





BARTENDER: 
 Hi, girls. What can I get you?

MARY LOUISE: A Bijou for me, and a Crème Yvette for my little flower here.


'

BARTENDER: I'm sorry, I have no idea what that is.




NORA: A gin martini and a "Sex on the Beach."

BARTENDER: Gotcha!




BARTENDER: So, let me guess-- old-fashioned devil and slutty angel? I love it.




MARY LOUISE: Beg your pardon?




NORA: Thanks! It's culled together with stuff I found on Pinterest.

BARTENDER: Oh, my God, Pinterest! I love Pinterest. I get half my recipes from it. I'm obsessed.




NORA: Obsessed!




WHITMORE MEDICAL CENTER



BONNIE: 
 Phasmatos exaud mi, conjug spiritis et corpe. Phasmatos exaud mi, conjug spiritis et corpe.




BONNIE: Oh. Scratch that one off the list...




ALARIC: Hey! You're not the only one banking on this.

DAMON: It's not for me, Ric! Why does everything have to be about me today?

BONNIE: 
 Will both of you just shut up? The stone works. I think it's creating a bridge between the body and the spirit. I just have to find a spell that makes that bridge permanent.




DAMON: So, how goes the diversion?

STEFAN: Three. That's the number of people Caroline and I have saved. Barely.

DAMON: 
 So, did you call just to brag?

STEFAN: 
 How much longer?




BONNIE: Oh, crap, Ric! Put it out!




DAMON: ...I think we're close.

SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



ENZO: 
 Ahhh. There's the mopey face I've come to know and love. I guess all it takes is a scolding from Lily to ruin breakfast.

VALERIE: 
 We have an ice box full of blood downstairs, you know.

ENZO: Yeah, but sometimes, it's nice to get out of the house...




ENZO: Take a drive, get out of town, come back. Wouldn't you agree?




VALERIE: Clearly I'm not as quick as the other orphans in the workhouse. Are you accusing me of something?

ENZO: Town surveillance has you on the road to and from Whitmore last night in a stolen car. Curious, how Oscar was also at Whitmore last night and has since mysteriously disappeared. So... heh... Yes, I am accusing you of something. I'm just not sure whether it's lying to Lily, or murder, or both.

VALERIE: 
 Forget everything you think you know, because you are wrong in ways you cannot even imagine.

ENZO: 
 Enlighten me. What exactly don't I know?




ENZO: Heh. Well, maybe it's easier if I just ask Lily. And I'm sure she'll be eager to uncover the truth and punish you for it.




VALERIE: I killed Oscar.




VALERIE: He knew too much. I had to prevent him from bringing a monster back into Lily's life.

ENZO: What monster is that?

VALERIE: Julian.




VALERIE: You don't know. I guess Lily doesn't tell you everything.

ENZO: 
 Who's Julian, Valerie?

VALERIE: Someone you'll want to keep as far away as possible... Assuming that one day, you want Lily to love you in the same way that you love her.




HEAVEN AND HELL BALL



STEFAN: Do you think they forgot they came here to murder people?

CAROLINE: Oh, no. They're just wrapped up in their own drama. See, Nora wants some breathing room, but Mary Louise is scared if she gives it to her, then Nora's gonna leave her.




STEFAN: You got all that from... that?

CAROLINE: Well, it's obvious!




CAROLINE: ...Or not.




STEFAN: You know, I'd ask you to dance, but...

CAROLINE: 
 But I'd kill you. How convenient. If only there was a person you could talk to about it...

STEFAN: I will ask Valerie to undo it once Damon brings Oscar back to life.

CAROLINE: 
 Wow. So, you're not technically avoiding, you're just waiting for Damon to raise the dead. Okay.

STEFAN: 
 Caroline, Valerie's been dead to me for 150 years.

CAROLINE: 
 Well, she's back now, and you're scared that you're gonna look her in the eye, and all of your feelings are gonna come back. You know, the infatuation, and the abandonment, and the whole freaking fairy-tale.




STEFAN: That's what I'm scared of? Or that's what you're scared of?

CAROLINE: 
 It can be both...




CAROLINE: God! You know what? I'm just too sober to be talking about this.







MARY LOUISE: Nora... Where did you go? I'm just tipsy enough to enjoy this music...




NORA: Have a taste! She's been sneaking tequila, so she's a little spicy. Heh.




NORA: What the hell?

MARY LOUISE: 
 Oh, don't act so shocked!

NORA: 
 Oh, don't pretend that was anything other than petty jealousy!

MARY LOUISE: This trashy girl wouldn't mean a damn thing to you if you weren't so desperate for attention!

NORA: 
 Attention? How could I possibly want attention when you've been perched on my shoulder for the last 120 years!

MARY LOUISE: 
 Oh, am I ruining your fun?

NORA: 
 "Stay close, Nora!" "Slow down, Nora!" As if it's still the bloody 19th century and I need your protection! I'm not the one struggling to adapt, Mary Lou-- you are!




MARY LOUISE: Very well. Do whatever you want. I'm going to finish what we came here to do.




WHITMORE MEDICAL CENTER



BONNIE: 
 Ababbas dagoineh mateesah elunatan. Oshawas melunaweh washaset zagoedan.




DAMON: Pfff.

ALARIC: 
 Which one was that?

BONNIE: It's something I found in one of your shamanistic oral traditions...




OSCAR: AHHHHHH!




BONNIE: Oh, my God!




DAMON: Bonnie? You are officially the most terrifying person I know.

DOWNTOWN WHITMORE COLLEGE AREA



DAMON: Easy there, buddy.

OSCAR: 
 Where am I?

DAMON: 
 You're on your way to Mystic Falls!

OSCAR: 
 Virginia? How did I get here?

DAMON: Well... We'll talk about it on the way. Smile for Mommy!




DAMON: Yeahhh. Okay.

OSCAR: 
 Blood. I need blood.

BONNIE: Figured you might.




ALARIC: Either our friend still has the munchies, or this ravenous hunger is a side-effect of resurrection.

BONNIE: 
 Don't look at me! I barely understand how the guy's alive. If hunger is the worst consequence of the stone spell, then we got off easy.




DAMON: Are you sure you want to do this to Jo?

ALARIC: 
 Listen, it's now or never, Damon.




DAMON: No offense, Ric, but I was asking Bonnie.




BONNIE: Look at you sad-sacks! What, am I gonna say no? Damon, go get your girl.




BONNIE: I'll get his.




SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



ENZO: Trick or treat?

LILY: 
 I've been tricked enough today. I still haven't heard a peep from the girls since they left.




ENZO: Who's Julian?

LILY: 
 Where did you hear that name?

ENZO: I've heard a lot of names in this house since I moved in. But Julian? That's a new one. Which means your family isn't talking about him for a reason.

LILY: 
 Well, that's nonsense. No one who ever met Julian would dare say a bad thing about him. He was a saint.




LILY: ...He was the love of my life.




ENZO: "Was?" Or "is?"




LILY: Ahh! Damon found Oscar!




HEAVEN AND HELL BALL



MARY LOUISE: 
 Get out of my way!

STEFAN: Why? You're done here.




MARY LOUISE: Oh. That's excellent news.

STEFAN: Where's Nora?

MARY LOUISE: 
 I don't know. We had a fight.




STEFAN: I'm sorry.




MARY LOUISE: Do not pity me!

STEFAN: 
 Trust me-- I don't.




MARY LOUISE: 
 Is this how relationships work in the modern era? Everyone peddling their flesh like a street bazaar? Because bloody Nora seems quite interested in the browsing.

STEFAN: 
 You know, these days, they have this wonderful thing called a "therapist."




MARY LOUISE: How old do you think I am?? I could think of nothing more futile than prattling on about one's emotions. As if I can prevent Nora from drifting away if I only find the right words...

STEFAN: Or as if confronting my first love will somehow make her disappear.




STEFAN: Caroline thinks that Valerie's mere existence is somehow sabotaging our relationship. But, if she could just get into my head, she would see that the only thing standing between me and my girlfriend is that damn spell... Which you can remove.




MARY LOUISE: UNGH!




STEFAN: I got you. Come on. Come on.




ROAD TO MYSTIC FALLS



OSCAR: 
 Can you... Can you slow down, please?

DAMON: Trust me-- you do not want to make Lily wait. I learned that the hard way.




DAMON: Here. This will take the edge off.

OSCAR: I'm gonna need more.




DAMON: Not 'til we get our story straight. We were in Myrtle Beach. We were wasted. You passed out.

OSCAR: 
 I've never been to Myrtle Beach...

DAMON: 
 How deep does this amnesia go?




OSCAR: I just need a little more, okay? Just... Just a taste. A drop.

DAMON: 
 Well, that was the last one.




OSCAR: Well, then you're gonna have to stop this thing!!




DAMON: Not until you get one right! Multiple choice: You were in Myrtle Beach, A) Partying too much; B)--




DAMON: HEY!




DAMON: 
 Ugh! Damn it!

MYSTIC FALLS SUBURBS



DAMON: Damn! Don't shoot the one person who can solve this case for you, Detective Dumbass.

MATT: 
 What happened?

DAMON: Oscar's acid-trip went from bad to worse. I've been tracking him through the woods.

MATT: 
 Damon, it's Halloween. There'll be ghost tours going through Mystic Falls every thirty minutes.

DAMON: Perfect. At least I know where he's going.




MATT: I'm going with you.

DAMON: 
 Donovan, that badge does not take away the fact that you are human. Please don't commit suicide by Heretic tonight.

MATT: 
 Since when do you care?




DAMON: Give me a break! I don't want to add your death to a long list of things that are already my fault.




WHITMORE COLLEGE



NORA: Mar?




NORA: Mary Lou? You can't avoid me for--




STEFAN: Siphon the repulsion spell off of Caroline, or your girlfriend dies. Do you see how easy I made that for you?

NORA: 
 Yes, thanks. Now, let me make it harder for you!




NORA: Get away from her!




CAROLINE: Grab my arm and siphon, or keep burning.




STEFAN: Did it work?




CAROLINE: Well, that was a lot more satisfying than I thought it would be.




MYSTIC FALLS CEMETERY



TOUR GUIDE: Any questions before we head to the final stop on our tour?




MALE CUSTOMER: Yeah. So, when does this get scary?

TOUR GUIDE: 
 Hey! This isn't some haunted hayride, okay? If you want teenagers dressed up in silly costumes giving you jump scares, go to Grove Hill.




TOUR GUIDE: 
 AHHHHHH!




CUSTOMERS: AHHHHH! AHHHH!




LILY: Oscar, enough!




LILY: What on earth has gotten into you?




LILY: Oscar, you're not yourself when you feed. You know that.




LILY: You remember how we live. You remember-- everything in moderation!




DAMON: 
 Now I get it. Your favorite sons are the ones with the Ripper problems. I highly recommend a detox and' an intervention. Now it's your turn-- where the hell is Elena?




HEAVEN AND HELL BALL



NORA: 
 Where are they?

MARY LOUISE: 
 It doesn't matter.




NORA: Of course it matters! They were going to hurt you! I'm going to find them, and rip their heads off, and smash them together like two disgusting melons, and...




NORA: Why are you smiling?

MARY LOUISE: I can't help it. You're adorable.




NORA: I'm sorry. You were right to worry.

MARY LOUISE: No. I'm sorry. We've been on our own-- scorned, abused, imprisoned-- for so long, I've forgotten that this world is meant to be enjoyed, not feared.




MARY LOUISE: Help me remember.




NORA: We should get back to Mystic Falls.

MARY LOUISE: We've spent an entire lifetime there. The night is ours.




WHITMORE COLLEGE



CAROLINE: No! Wait, wait, wait. This can't happen yet!

STEFAN: Yes, it can. That's the whole point.




CAROLINE: No! I need you to know that I am not some insecure, jealous girlfriend, okay?

STEFAN: Mmhmm.




CAROLINE: It's just when I get something that I've wanted for a really long time, sometimes I do this thing--

STEFAN: 
 --You overthink things. Yeah, I know.

CAROLINE: Yeah, but sometimes, I say things that I don't really need to say, but I'm just scared that I'm the only one thinking them.




STEFAN: The reason that I'm not talking about Valerie is because I'm not thinking about Valerie. I'm thinking about you, and how you and I have had more history in the last five years than most people have in a lifetime.




MYSTIC GRILL



MATT: Hey. This is off-limits to...




MATT: You're one of the Heretics.

VALERIE: 
 Yep. Don't do anything stupid.

MATT: Right now, there's a tour bus full of corpses in the cemetery because I didn't do anything stupid.

VALERIE: Well, I'm in danger of being exiled from my family because I did something extra stupid.




VALERIE: Join me for a drink?

MATT: 
 If you're not gone by the time I count to three, I'll shoot you right now.




MATT: One... two...




ENZO: 
 Stick to tourists.




ENZO: You're welcome.

VALERIE: 
 I'm swooning on the inside.

ENZO: 
 Heh.

VALERIE: In case it's not entirely obvious by now, I came here to be alone.

ENZO: Or, you're planning your escape. Only a matter of time before Oscar sobers up and fingers you as his would-be murderer, which clearly you're bloody awful at.

VALERIE: 
 What do you want, Enzo?

ENZO: I want, dear, not-so-innocent Valerie, for you to tell me how we're going to prevent Julian from walking back into Lily's life.




MYSTIC FALLS CEMETERY
[Damon has just set the victims of Oscar's Halloween tour bus massacre on fire to hide the evidence before returning to talk to Lily

LILY: I've asked Beau to remove the cloaking spell from Elena's coffin. You will find her in the ruins of the old Salvatore mansion.

DAMON: 
 Clever... ish.

LILY: 
 I do think so.




DAMON: I'm moving back to Mystic Falls.




LILY: 
 I will certainly ask the family to take it under consideration.

DAMON: 
 It wasn't a request. These people didn't deserve to be killed by one of your free-range children; Stefan's up to his hero-hair in Heretic drama; and I worry that Matt Donovan's funeral is gonna cut into my social schedule.

LILY: 
 And what? You're gonna help keep order? Damon, you could hardly keep a covered box safe. You do realize that this innate desire to keep Elena physically present in your life, this boyish refusal to let her go, will only put her in more danger? After everything you've been through, what a shame it would be to lose her because you're too terrified to find out who you actually are without her.




LILY: If you dare to return to Mystic Falls, it's no skin off my nose.




DAMON: I want one more thing.

CLOSING MONTAGE



DAMON: 
 Dear Elena... Yes, you heard that correctly-- Hell has frozen over. I'm writing it all down. Granted, I'm a half-bottle in, thanks to my 1950 Chateau Cheval Blanc, a bottle I waited 65 years to open. I used to spend nights sitting in my wine cellar, convincing myself I could actually hear it age-- tannins growing, fermenting. But, appreciating its beauty didn't make the time go by any faster. The bottle just laid there on its shelf, torturing me while I waited for Katherine and time stood still.





DAMON: 
 Eventually, I convinced myself that no sip of that wine could ever taste as good as I dreamt it would, so I hid the bottle and walked away. And that is the story of why I drink bourbon.





DAMON: 
 I don't know who I am without you. But I do know that as long as I'm without you, time will stand still.





DAMON: 
 So, who is Damon Salvatore without Elena Gilbert? A selfish friend?





DAMON: 
 A jealous brother?





DAMON: 
 A horrible son?







DAMON: 
 Or maybe, with a little luck, I'll do right by you. Because you may be one thousand miles away, or one hundred years away, but you're still with me, and my heart is right there in that coffin with you...





DAMON: 
 ...Until you come back to me.
