ALARIC: Oh, damn it!
GIRLS: Is it fixed yet?
ALARIC: 
GIRLS: 
ALARIC: Yes, it is! Do you want to brush your teeth?
GIRLS: No!!
ALARIC: Yeah? Well, too bad!
ALARIC: Surgery will have to resume tomorrow.
ALARIC: All right. Josie, help your sister find her PJs, okay?
ALARIC: 
ALARIC: Damon.
DAMON: 
DAMON: Heh. You girls, too.
ALARIC: Stand behind daddy.
DAMON: Why so gloomy? Looks like you got everything you wanted.
ALARIC: 
DAMON: No, not yet. But, if you don't do exactly as I say, that could change real fast.
DAMON: So, you gonna invite me in?
ASSISTANT: Jeez, you're here... At five AM.
ALARIC: 
ASSISTANT: 
ALARIC: You have no idea how weird it's gonna get.
ALARIC: Is this enough to buy some privacy?
ASSISTANT: I'm gonna throw in a free reality check-- preserved bodies still have an expiration date, and this is her last day.
ASSISTANT: She doesn't have to stay home, but she can't stay here.
DAMON: Mother, tell me you have Elena.
LILY: Let me speak to Oscar.
DAMON: No can do. I'm about to wake him up from his little vervain nap.
LILY: 
DAMON: 
LILY: And yet, you're leveraging a member of my family just to get her body closer to you. How selfish can you be?
DAMON: Spare the lecture, Mommy.
LILY: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: Oscar...
DAMON: 
DAMON: I can smell the blood on you, buddy.
DAMON: Huh?
DAMON: You've gotta be kidding me!
CAROLINE: Ahem.
BONNIE: I didn't want to wake you.
CAROLINE: Well, I would lose more sleep if you just snuck out without saying hi!
BONNIE: Hi!
CAROLINE: Mmm... I missed this.
BONNIE: 
CAROLINE: No! I just can't touch vampires. Valerie basically turned my skin into vervain.
BONNIE: I'll work on unraveling the spell when I--
CAROLINE: Stop! We have so much to catch up on. Let's just go shopping for Halloween costumes and we can worry about magic later.
BONNIE: Kind of worrying about magic already. Alaric think we can reunite Jo's spirit with her body by using some sketchy Native American resurrection stone. My job is to crush his dreams in the most gentle way possible.
CAROLINE: Wow! Okay... You don't even think it'll work?
BONNIE: I don't think it should. The Other Side is gone, there's no more Gemini prison world, which means Jo's spirit... is probably at peace.
CAROLINE: 
BONNIE: Tell me about it.
STEFAN: How the hell did you let this happen?
DAMON: 
STEFAN: No, you're just the one who chased him down, kidnapped him... and are still technically holding him hostage.
DAMON: To get Elena back!
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: I don't have to be on her side to see what's happening here. You can't be with Elena, so you're making all your bad decisions about Elena.
DAMON: We need to get rid of this body.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Ugh!
ENZO: Breakkie! What are we having?
VALERIE: Mushroom omelettes.
VALERIE: Hey! They're for Oscar, not you. He's coming home today.
ENZO: I'm impressed. Especially considering how late you got home last night.
VALERIE: Where's Oscar?
LILY: I don't know. Damon never showed up. I suppose I've taken the notion of trust for granted lately.
LILY: Lorenzo, would you mind terribly if I had a moment alone with Valerie?
ENZO: Is something wrong?
LILY: 
LILY: I spent yesterday with Stefan. Learned all about your little tryst in 1863.
VALERIE: 
LILY: 
VALERIE: 
LILY: You told him you were coming back for him, and he believed you. Why put him through that?
VALERIE: 
LILY: I will only say this once. If you have anything to tell me-- anything at all-- now is the time.
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: I should go look for Oscar.
LILY: That won't be necessary.
NORA: God, it feels good to come out of that deserted town and be around living, breathing humans we can eat! Mystic Falls is the prison world all over again.
LOUISE: We're on a mission, Nora. Not a vacation.
DAMON: All right...
LOUISE: Damon? I know you're in here. Open up!
LOUISE: Damon, open the--
DAMON: Hello.
DAMON: Oh. Hello.
LOUISE: University housing. How lovely.
NORA: 
LOUISE: 
DAMON: 
LOUISE: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: And I've been judging.
DAMON: Yeah.
STEFAN: Not gonna find him in there.
DAMON: 
DAMON: Oscar turned the tables, and he knocked me out, and he took off. I lost my one and only bargaining chip.
LOUISE: 
DAMON: 
NORA: 
LOUISE: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Hey!
DAMON: Screw it. Let's just get this guy to the furnace.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Hmmm. 'Kay.
STEFAN: "A message from Miss Nora Hildegard, dictated but not read. For every hour that Oscar isn't returned, a Whitmore student will die... Starting now."
DAMON: No!
GUIDE: With dozens of disappearances and a history of animal attacks, Mystic Falls was the subject of supernatural speculation even before the quote-unquote "mining fire evacuation."
GUIDE: We're not doing anything illegal, Officer.
MATT: Besides violating a town-wide quarantine and putting these people's lives at risk to make a quick buck? Pack it up and get out of here.
GUIDE: 
ENZO: Really? You hear about the noises in the old boarding house? The mysterious figure haunting the clock tower? Tell your ghostbusters to charge up their proton packs-- they've hit the proverbial jackpot!
MATT: Get out of here, unless you want your license suspended. Now.
GUIDE: Come on. Let's go.
MATT: If you touch any of these people, I will shoot you right here.
ENZO: 
MATT: 
ENZO: 
MATT: 
ENZO: 
CAROLINE: Hi.
STEFAN: Hi! Brought you coffee.
CAROLINE: Oh, and he keeps getting better!
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: I take it your charm didn't work on getting Valerie to undo the spell?
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: No. There's nothing to avoid.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Yeah, but that is quite an assumption, considering that she's the reason why I literally can't touch you.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Let's just say that it involves two bored mean-girls on a campus full of easy targets. But, I have come up with a genius plan to keep them occupied while Damon sorts out his Oscar problem.
CAROLINE: The dance?
STEFAN: Mmhmm.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: And distractions! All in one place. Easy to babysit. I think the hardest part will be feigning enthusiasm.
CAROLINE: Yeah, they'll never fall for it... Unless they think it's their idea?
NORA: I'm getting hungry. Is it death-o'clock yet?
LOUISE: We still have thirteen minutes.
NORA: What's this?
CAROLINE: Oh, nothing. It's just some silly "Heaven and Hell" ball. Stefan invited me, but I don't know. These days, Halloween just seems like an excuse to get drunk and show skin...
CAROLINE: Sorry. No Heretics allowed. Halloween's only for people who dress up as psychopaths!
LOUISE: 
NORA: As if you'd even know how to do that. We're going!
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: Oh, okay! Okay, good luck with that.
NORA: 
CAROLINE: Nothing! No, you two will fit in just fine. Seriously, you guys have nothing to feel self-conscious about.
LOUISE: Did I say you could leave?
CAROLINE: What do you want?
CAROLINE: I see you found a dress... from my closet.
LOUISE: I haven't been to a party since New Year's 1902. Be honest-- will I make a proper modern devil?
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: ...Unlike the hips of that dress.
LOUISE: Would you prefer I chose a different one and dyed it with your blood?
CAROLINE: Look, I gave you an outfit. Now, it's your turn. Siphon off this annoying anti-vampire spell.
LOUISE: 
CAROLINE: What do you care about some silly spell? You don't even like Valerie.
LOUISE: You're right. I don't. I've had to endure two lifetimes with that conniving shrew, and I've learned that when it comes to Val? You don't get on her bad side.
NORA: Not happening, Stefan. Look, if I siphon Caroline's spell, Valerie will find out, and she'll retaliate with something much worse. The girl is a rancid bitch.
STEFAN: That's not the Valerie that I knew.
NORA: 
LOUISE: 
LOUISE: Well?
NORA: Hmmm. Not bad!
LOUISE: 
NORA: No, you look nice! It's just... kind of plain. But, I can sex it up for you.
LOUISE: 
LOUISE: Stop it!
NORA: 
LOUISE: 
LOUISE: It's fifteen minutes past the hour. Distraction period over.
NORA: 
ALARIC: 
BONNIE: 
ALARIC: Well, if it makes any difference, this is worth some serious extra credit.
BONNIE: 
BONNIE: And the visions from that stone scare the hell out of me, so... Don't. Rush. Me.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: You weren't... Oh, I don't know... Already coming to this and just, uh, forgot to invite me?
CAROLINE: I didn't forget to invite you. I just felt like a Halloween party wasn't great first-date material.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: Oh, they're here. Guess it's time to babysit.
BARTENDER: 
LOUISE: A Bijou for me, and a Crème Yvette for my little flower here.
BARTENDER: I'm sorry, I have no idea what that is.
NORA: A gin martini and a "Sex on the Beach."
BARTENDER: Gotcha!
BARTENDER: So, let me guess-- old-fashioned devil and slutty angel? I love it.
LOUISE: Beg your pardon?
NORA: Thanks! It's culled together with stuff I found on Pinterest.
BARTENDER: Oh, my God, Pinterest! I love Pinterest. I get half my recipes from it. I'm obsessed.
NORA: Obsessed!
BONNIE: 
BONNIE: Oh. Scratch that one off the list...
ALARIC: Hey! You're not the only one banking on this.
DAMON: It's not for me, Ric! Why does everything have to be about me today?
BONNIE: 
DAMON: So, how goes the diversion?
STEFAN: Three. That's the number of people Caroline and I have saved. Barely.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
BONNIE: Oh, crap, Ric! Put it out!
DAMON: ...I think we're close.
ENZO: 
VALERIE: 
ENZO: Yeah, but sometimes, it's nice to get out of the house...
ENZO: Take a drive, get out of town, come back. Wouldn't you agree?
VALERIE: Clearly I'm not as quick as the other orphans in the workhouse. Are you accusing me of something?
ENZO: Town surveillance has you on the road to and from Whitmore last night in a stolen car. Curious, how Oscar was also at Whitmore last night and has since mysteriously disappeared. So... heh... Yes, I am accusing you of something. I'm just not sure whether it's lying to Lily, or murder, or both.
VALERIE: 
ENZO: 
ENZO: Heh. Well, maybe it's easier if I just ask Lily. And I'm sure she'll be eager to uncover the truth and punish you for it.
VALERIE: I killed Oscar.
VALERIE: He knew too much. I had to prevent him from bringing a monster back into Lily's life.
ENZO: What monster is that?
VALERIE: Julian.
VALERIE: You don't know. I guess Lily doesn't tell you everything.
ENZO: 
VALERIE: Someone you'll want to keep as far away as possible... Assuming that one day, you want Lily to love you in the same way that you love her.
STEFAN: Do you think they forgot they came here to murder people?
CAROLINE: Oh, no. They're just wrapped up in their own drama. See, Nora wants some breathing room, but Mary Louise is scared if she gives it to her, then Nora's gonna leave her.
STEFAN: You got all that from... that?
CAROLINE: Well, it's obvious!
CAROLINE: ...Or not.
STEFAN: You know, I'd ask you to dance, but...
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: I will ask Valerie to undo it once Damon brings Oscar back to life.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: That's what I'm scared of? Or that's what you're scared of?
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: God! You know what? I'm just too sober to be talking about this.
LOUISE: Nora... Where did you go? I'm just tipsy enough to enjoy this music...
NORA: Have a taste! She's been sneaking tequila, so she's a little spicy. Heh.
NORA: What the hell?
LOUISE: 
NORA: 
LOUISE: This trashy girl wouldn't mean a damn thing to you if you weren't so desperate for attention!
NORA: 
LOUISE: 
NORA: 
LOUISE: Very well. Do whatever you want. I'm going to finish what we came here to do.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: Pfff.
ALARIC: 
BONNIE: It's something I found in one of your shamanistic oral traditions...
OSCAR: AHHHHHH!
BONNIE: Oh, my God!
DAMON: Bonnie? You are officially the most terrifying person I know.
DAMON: Easy there, buddy.
OSCAR: 
DAMON: 
OSCAR: 
DAMON: Well... We'll talk about it on the way. Smile for Mommy!
DAMON: Yeahhh. Okay.
OSCAR: 
BONNIE: Figured you might.
ALARIC: Either our friend still has the munchies, or this ravenous hunger is a side-effect of resurrection.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: Are you sure you want to do this to Jo?
ALARIC: 
DAMON: No offense, Ric, but I was asking Bonnie.
BONNIE: Look at you sad-sacks! What, am I gonna say no? Damon, go get your girl.
BONNIE: I'll get his.
ENZO: Trick or treat?
LILY: 
ENZO: Who's Julian?
LILY: 
ENZO: I've heard a lot of names in this house since I moved in. But Julian? That's a new one. Which means your family isn't talking about him for a reason.
LILY: 
LILY: ...He was the love of my life.
ENZO: "Was?" Or "is?"
LILY: Ahh! Damon found Oscar!
LOUISE: 
STEFAN: Why? You're done here.
LOUISE: Oh. That's excellent news.
STEFAN: Where's Nora?
LOUISE: 
STEFAN: I'm sorry.
LOUISE: Do not pity me!
STEFAN: 
LOUISE: 
STEFAN: 
LOUISE: How old do you think I am?? I could think of nothing more futile than prattling on about one's emotions. As if I can prevent Nora from drifting away if I only find the right words...
STEFAN: Or as if confronting my first love will somehow make her disappear.
STEFAN: Caroline thinks that Valerie's mere existence is somehow sabotaging our relationship. But, if she could just get into my head, she would see that the only thing standing between me and my girlfriend is that damn spell... Which you can remove.
LOUISE: UNGH!
STEFAN: I got you. Come on. Come on.
OSCAR: 
DAMON: Trust me-- you do not want to make Lily wait. I learned that the hard way.
DAMON: Here. This will take the edge off.
OSCAR: I'm gonna need more.
DAMON: Not 'til we get our story straight. We were in Myrtle Beach. We were wasted. You passed out.
OSCAR: 
DAMON: 
OSCAR: I just need a little more, okay? Just... Just a taste. A drop.
DAMON: 
OSCAR: Well, then you're gonna have to stop this thing!!
DAMON: Not until you get one right! Multiple choice: You were in Myrtle Beach, A) Partying too much; B)--
DAMON: HEY!
DAMON: 
DAMON: Damn! Don't shoot the one person who can solve this case for you, Detective Dumbass.
MATT: 
DAMON: Oscar's acid-trip went from bad to worse. I've been tracking him through the woods.
MATT: 
DAMON: Perfect. At least I know where he's going.
MATT: I'm going with you.
DAMON: 
MATT: 
DAMON: Give me a break! I don't want to add your death to a long list of things that are already my fault.
NORA: Mar?
NORA: Mary Lou? You can't avoid me for--
STEFAN: Siphon the repulsion spell off of Caroline, or your girlfriend dies. Do you see how easy I made that for you?
NORA: 
NORA: Get away from her!
CAROLINE: Grab my arm and siphon, or keep burning.
STEFAN: Did it work?
CAROLINE: Well, that was a lot more satisfying than I thought it would be.
GUIDE: Any questions before we head to the final stop on our tour?
CUSTOMER: Yeah. So, when does this get scary?
GUIDE: 
GUIDE: 
CUSTOMERS: AHHHHH! AHHHH!
LILY: Oscar, enough!
LILY: What on earth has gotten into you?
LILY: Oscar, you're not yourself when you feed. You know that.
LILY: You remember how we live. You remember-- everything in moderation!
DAMON: 
NORA: 
LOUISE: 
NORA: Of course it matters! They were going to hurt you! I'm going to find them, and rip their heads off, and smash them together like two disgusting melons, and...
NORA: Why are you smiling?
LOUISE: I can't help it. You're adorable.
NORA: I'm sorry. You were right to worry.
LOUISE: No. I'm sorry. We've been on our own-- scorned, abused, imprisoned-- for so long, I've forgotten that this world is meant to be enjoyed, not feared.
LOUISE: Help me remember.
NORA: We should get back to Mystic Falls.
LOUISE: We've spent an entire lifetime there. The night is ours.
CAROLINE: No! Wait, wait, wait. This can't happen yet!
STEFAN: Yes, it can. That's the whole point.
CAROLINE: No! I need you to know that I am not some insecure, jealous girlfriend, okay?
STEFAN: Mmhmm.
CAROLINE: It's just when I get something that I've wanted for a really long time, sometimes I do this thing--
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Yeah, but sometimes, I say things that I don't really need to say, but I'm just scared that I'm the only one thinking them.
STEFAN: The reason that I'm not talking about Valerie is because I'm not thinking about Valerie. I'm thinking about you, and how you and I have had more history in the last five years than most people have in a lifetime.
MATT: Hey. This is off-limits to...
MATT: You're one of the Heretics.
VALERIE: 
MATT: Right now, there's a tour bus full of corpses in the cemetery because I didn't do anything stupid.
VALERIE: Well, I'm in danger of being exiled from my family because I did something extra stupid.
VALERIE: Join me for a drink?
MATT: 
MATT: One... two...
ENZO: 
ENZO: You're welcome.
VALERIE: 
ENZO: 
VALERIE: In case it's not entirely obvious by now, I came here to be alone.
ENZO: Or, you're planning your escape. Only a matter of time before Oscar sobers up and fingers you as his would-be murderer, which clearly you're bloody awful at.
VALERIE: 
ENZO: I want, dear, not-so-innocent Valerie, for you to tell me how we're going to prevent Julian from walking back into Lily's life.
LILY: I've asked Beau to remove the cloaking spell from Elena's coffin. You will find her in the ruins of the old Salvatore mansion.
DAMON: 
LILY: 
DAMON: I'm moving back to Mystic Falls.
LILY: 
DAMON: 
LILY: 
LILY: If you dare to return to Mystic Falls, it's no skin off my nose.
DAMON: I want one more thing.
