TYLER: Hello?
STEFAN: 
TYLER: 
STEFAN: 
TYLER: Okay, I'm on it. But you should be running.
STEFAN: I'm way ahead of you. Take care of yourself, Tyler.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: You seen my phone?
ALARIC: I've, uh, seen your empties, your dinner...
ALARIC: Your razor.
ALARIC: You know, some clothes would be nice.
DAMON: Got it!
ALARIC: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: Relax! It's just 'til we hunt down Lily's lone-wolf Heretic and swap him out for my girlfriend in a coma.
ALARIC: 
DAMON: Pretty soon, thanks to Donovan. A phrase no one has uttered... ever.
DAMON: He's checking Lily's cell phone records.
DAMON: Hi, Bon-Bon!
BONNIE: Please tell me I'm not interrupting something...
ALARIC: 
BONNIE: That Phoenix Stone that I touched yesterday... you did destroy it like you promised me, correct?
ALARIC: 
BONNIE: I just had another vision-- a flash of horrified people with x-shaped wounds on their skin. And, when I opened my eyes, ten minutes had gone by.
ALARIC: The stone's gone. I, you know, watched in dissolve in hydrofluoric acid.
BONNIE: 
ALARIC: 
DAMON: Who wants to go to Myrtle Beach?
BONNIE: I'm busy.
ALARIC: 
DAMON: Well, that's too bad, because Lily made a bunch of phone calls that bounced off a cell tower there, and something tells me she's not making plans for her spring break.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: Tell you what-- you ask him yourself after he's safe in my car's trunk, hmmm? So, anyone up for an old-fashioned hostage-swap?
ALARIC: Does agreeing to go mean you putting on pants?
DAMON: I'll even give you shotgun!
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: I hate you both.
CAROLINE: Hello?
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: How are you on my phone right now?
CAROLINE: You must have dropped it when you got threshold-vacuumed out of here yesterday.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Well, I'm spelled into your room by a menagerie of mean girls, but other than that...
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: I'll be fine. Just keep Damon from killing any more Heretics.
STEFAN: I will. Lily's only keeping you there to turn me against Damon. I'll convince her that I hate his guts, and she'll have made her point.
CAROLINE: Who's Valerie Tulle? You wrote about her in your journal from 1863. She must have found a copy in the prison world.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Yeah. Dirty-blonde hair, blue eyes? She's one of my new psycho housemates...
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: Dirty-blonde hair, blue eyes, psycho. Summarized me to a tee!
STEFAN: Caroline?
STEFAN: You can take my town, you can destroy my house, but you will not touch my car.
LILY: Good morning, Stefan.
STEFAN: 
LILY: I was out practicing my driving and saw an opportunity to work on my parallel parking.
LILY: I must have run over a nail or something. The streets around here are a disgrace.
STEFAN: Listen-- you need to tell those spoiled brats living in my house to stop torturing Caroline.
LILY: 
STEFAN: Damon and I aren't really speaking right now.
LILY: 
STEFAN: 
LILY: Then I will give a lecture to the girls on their manners.
STEFAN: 
LILY: 
STEFAN: 
LILY: Because, Stefan... I sent her to you.
VALERIE: You have to move.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: I'm Valerie Tulle.
STEFAN: Stefan Salvatore. Are you new to town?
VALERIE: Just passing through.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Ohhh....
VALERIE: How do you have this?
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: Wouldn't you like to know?
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: Why did you send Valerie to me?
LILY: To check on you. Like any mother longing for her children, I was in a black hole of depression.
LILY: Yes, Stefan, I'm more than the cold-hearted snake you and your brother wish me to be. It took me a long time to get over losing you.
LILY: Anyway, I had been invited to travel to Europe with a... a vampire gentleman-friend of mine, but I refused to leave until I knew that my boys were okay.
STEFAN: 
LILY: His name was Julian.
LILY: What? You're acting as if that's absurd.
STEFAN: Well, your first husband shot and killed his own sons, so you'll have to excuse me if I don't trust your type.
LILY: Julian was nothing like your father.
STEFAN: 
LILY: 
JULIAN: For the soldiers!
JULIAN: Have your tickets ready, ladies! The men on the battlefield need us!
JULIAN: 
VALERIE: You have to hold still! It will be delicious, I promise.
JULIAN: Oh, ho ho ho! Aren't we lady-like?
VALERIE: Stefan... Meet Julian.
STEFAN: Your daughter and I were just appreciating the scientific wonder of gravitational force!
JULIAN: Hmm. How wise you must sound to less intelligent men.
VALERIE: Julian is not my father.
STEFAN: 
JULIAN: 
JULIAN: Valerie, darling-- a word?
VALERIE: 
JULIAN: 
VALERIE: Lily sent us here to get a sense of his mood...
JULIAN: Exactly. His mood, not his manhood. Remember, his mother gave very strict instructions for us to keep our distance. Do not displease her.
VALERIE: I have everything under control.
VALERIE: I was lying. I wasn't prepared for how taken I was with him. He was gorgeous and sweet...
CAROLINE: And that's when you compelled him to write all those nice things about you in his journal. Spoiler! I've heard this story before, when a sweet, little orphan girl named Katherine Pierce waltzed into his life.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: I have a brother who's away at war, a father who judges me for not joining him, and a mother who was strong and kind. She died when I was ten.
VALERIE: I'm so sorry.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: Then we shall elude him!
VALERIE: Come.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: How did he not see us?
VALERIE: 
CAROLINE: And then...?
VALERIE: 
CAROLINE: I know why you put that burning spell on me. It's not so Mary Louise and Nora couldn't touch me. It's so Stefan wouldn't. Be more obvious.
VALERIE: Well, since you're so curious... Please, allow me to continue.
STEFAN: Julian is going to kill me.
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: Is something wrong?
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: Do you mind if I...?
VALERIE: It was his first time. I'm sure you've been someone's first, so you know what it's like to have a completely unforgettable place in someone else's mind.
CAROLINE: ...Of course.
VALERIE: That's what I thought.
ALARIC: Okay, so... what's the plan?
DAMON: Okay-- fair trade. One Heretic in good condition for the coffin housing Elena.
ALARIC: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: B-Town stuns him with magic, you shoot him with vervain, I--
DAMON: --Snap his neck.
BONNIE: Yeah, but after we get him to siphon away my visions.
ALARIC: 
BONNIE: 
DAMON: Any other suggestions of how we can rid Bonnie of this mysterious pain she's in, Ric?
DAMON: Room service! Free shrimp!
OSCAR: Hey, you folks have the wrong... Holy--!
OSCAR: Damon Salvatore!
DAMON: 
OSCAR: Of course I know you! It's good to see you're well, old friend. Come here, man!
DAMON: Hey, all right...
OSCAR: Haha! Come in, come in!
OSCAR: Uh, you caught me in the middle of a seventy-two hour social gathering...
OSCAR: Ahhh... Make yourself at home!
OSCAR: Uh, friend with the vervain gun? If you could holster that, I sure would feel a lot more comfortable.
BONNIE: How do you know Damon?
OSCAR: 
OSCAR: Nothing?
DAMON: 
OSCAR: Heh, right, right, right. Uh, well, your mom was going through a rough patch. She could not move on until she knew her boys were okay, so she sent me out to find you.
DAMON: 
OSCAR: 
OSCAR: All emotions are valid and welcome here. But, it's the truth. She just wanted to know you were happy, Damon. She loved you.
OSCAR: Hey, you guys, what can I get you? Cocktail? Joint?
OSCAR: Jenny?
DAMON: 
OSCAR: Hey, hey, hey! Shhhh! Hahahahaha!
STEFAN: No, no, no! Keep the car on this side of the road!
LILY: Valerie never told me about your romance...
STEFAN: Well, Valerie never told me that you were alive.
LILY: 
STEFAN: 
LILY: She told me that you'd forgotten all about me. She said you had moved on. That... That was the only way I was able to move on, as well.
STEFAN: My mother was practically ripped out of my arms and sent to a TB ward. You don't move on from that. You find distractions.
STEFAN: Come with me. I want to show you something.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: This is my mother's grave.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: I always wonder what would have happened if I had just been able to run a little faster. The tonic would have helped her. She could have lived.
VALERIE: Were these the kind of flowers you were sent for?
STEFAN: Yes. Cream...
VALERIE: Cream violets.
VALERIE: That tonic would not have saved her.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: But I am. I worked in a sanatorium, caring for patients who were just like your mother. Cream violets have no medicinal properties. It's an old wives' tale.
VALERIE: Your father sent you on a fool's errand. You were only ten. He... probably wanted you out of the house to make it easier on himself.
VALERIE: No matter what, you couldn't have saved your mother. Her death is not your fault.
JULIAN: Time to say goodbye.
JULIAN: I expected you would visit here sooner or later.
STEFAN: 
JULIAN: We are leaving for New York now.
VALERIE: 
JULIAN: 
STEFAN: When will I see you again?
VALERIE: I will find my way back to you. I promise.
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: 
ALARIC: So, why did Lily send you here?
OSCAR: 
OSCAR: You know you can get a drink served to you in a fishbowl here? Hahaha!
OSCAR: Oh, hey! The other day, I called a number on this card, and just like that, I had a girlfriend!
BONNIE: 
OSCAR: But she really got who I am, you know?
OSCAR: It was a beautiful human experience! And that's what I've discovered here... freedom. The bad trip inside that prison world has ended, my friends, and I am breathing in what my soul was craving: f-r-e-e-dom.
BONNIE: 
OSCAR: 
DAMON: Let me translate for you-- my friends were playing with some mystical tool they didn't quite understand, and now Bonnie's chasing her own white rabbit around the farm...
OSCAR: 
DAMON: Just think of it as one big magical toke!
OSCAR: 
DAMON: Siphon the damn visions, we don't tell Lily that we saw you avoiding whatever mission you were sent to do, and we'll call it a day.
OSCAR: Okay, then.
OSCAR: Come on.
OSCAR: Ready?
BONNIE: Yeah.
OSCAR: Where's the Phoenix Stone?
BONNIE: 
OSCAR: 
OSCAR: 
DAMON: Good news? Your visions are gone. Bad news? So's Oscar.
ALARIC: Ohhh...
ALARIC: He took the stone.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: We need to find him right now.
BONNIE: Did you know he still had it?
DAMON: Aw, come on! I mean, yo-- I-- A litt--
DAMON: ...Kind of. Ric, tell her what happened.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: ...I live with the guy! Guys... know stuff.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: Wait! I'm not gonna be stuck in the middle of this. No, no-- you sort this out. I'm gonna go find our bargaining chip.
BONNIE: So the visions, the lost time, the crippling headaches... they don't mean anything? Doesn't it matter to you?
ALARIC: Oh, of course they matter! But bringing Jo back matters more.
BONNIE: You don't even know what this stone does... if it will work!
ALARIC: I was dead. Gone. And so were you, Bonnie. We came back. We got our second chance.
BONNIE: 
ALARIC: 
STEFAN: No, no. Keep your eyes on the road.
STEFAN: Make a left here. It'll take us back into town.
LILY: Is there anything else you'd like to know?
STEFAN: No. I mean, it doesn't matter-- obviously, it was all a lie, right?
LILY: 
STEFAN: Well, Valerie was using me.
LILY: 
STEFAN: 
LILY: 
STEFAN: No? How about the part where she sent me a telegram saying she was coming back?
LILY: 
STEFAN: She'd been gone a few months...
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: 
LILY: Surely you're not still angry with her...
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: Eventually, he accepted that he'd been abandoned all over again, and then he walked home under the cold and distant stars.
CAROLINE: 
VALERIE: There was a change of plan. I'm done talking to you about this.
JULIAN: Slipping away before sunrise on the very day our ship leaves for England?
VALERIE: Let me pass! I'm not going.
JULIAN: 
JULIAN: Because Lily will not travel anywhere without her precious little orphans, and it is imperative that I leave today.
JULIAN: Do I frighten you?
VALERIE: 
JULIAN: 
DAMON: I lied. I do remember you. I was fighting for the South. It's not exactly a time I like to reminisce about in front of my friends.
OSCAR: Yeah, you had the same opinion back then. Hated everything your side believed in. Hey, you wanted to desert, but feared shaming your old man.
DAMON: 
OSCAR: 
OSCAR: You know what? A little extra piece of advice-- A lot of people want the Phoenix Stone. Mess with it, and you end up dead.
DAMON: 
OSCAR: 
DAMON: Let's just say I'd like to cash you in for something way better.
OSCAR: 
BONNIE: 
OSCAR: AHHH!
BONNIE: Never lie to me again.
DAMON: Aw, my besties are buds again! Let's go make a deal.
LILY: Is Valerie here?
CAROLINE: 
LILY: Forgive me for prying, but I heard your mother died this last spring...
CAROLINE: 
LILY: 
CAROLINE: 
LILY: Of course I had a mother.
CAROLINE: Then you know that love is different than any other kind of love.
CAROLINE: Stefan wrote about you all the time. You can read for yourself.
CAROLINE: Here.
CAROLINE: He loved you. He missed you.
LILY: Nora, remove the barrier spell, please.
LILY: As of this moment, Miss Forbes is no longer a prisoner.
CAROLINE: What, is this one of those mean-girl tricks?
LILY: No, it's a reward for Stefan's honesty. Go... before I change my mind.
CAROLINE: I don't know what made your heart grow four sizes today... but thanks.
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: It's strange to be here with you... finally able to tell you the truth.
VALERIE: Please don't tell Lily.
JULIAN: 
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: 
LILY: Thank you.
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: You don't know how sorry I am.... about everything.
VALERIE: 
BONNIE: So, what does a rock that makes you see screaming people have to do with reincarnation?
ALARIC: I don't know.
ALARIC: But, I've read that book already, cover-to-cover, and it's a waste of time.
ALARIC: In fact, all of these are a waste of time. They talk about resurrection, the phoenix rising from the ashes, but nothing about a stone that brings people back from the dead.
BONNIE: 
ALARIC: 
ALARIC: The hospital can only preserve the body for a set amount of time. I've been paying off the tech to fake the logs.
ALARIC: Jo's still in there. She has to be.
BONNIE: Ric...
ALARIC: 
BONNIE: ...I'll try.
LILY: Damon.
DAMON: You should have come yourself.
LILY: 
DAMON: Gettysburg, 1863-- if that had been you, it would have changed the entire course of my life.
LILY: I was supposed to be dead.
DAMON: And I was supposed to be your son.
LILY: 
DAMON: Your prodigal Heretic was Fear and Loathing in the armpit of Myrtle Beach.
LILY: 
DAMON: Don't worry, Mommy-- he's in the middle of a vervain detox. Give me Elena. Maybe I won't kill him.
LILY: You will not lay a hand on another member of my family.
DAMON: 
DAMON: So did I. Why don't we end this mutual disdain once and for all? Give me Elena, you get your son back.
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: Ahhh!
STEFAN: How did you escape?
CAROLINE: I didn't. Lily let me go.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Heh... Look, I was just a kid when I met her. Just a troubled boy mourning his dead mom. I was young and human.
CAROLINE: I was young and human when you and I met, and I remember the exact moment when I met you.
CAROLINE: And do you remember the first time that you ever saw me?
CAROLINE: I'm sorry. That was totally unfair. Just... please forget I asked. I mean, you were even sitting next to Elena, so of course you only had eyes for her...
STEFAN: Things have changed. Different circumstances, different results.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Of course not.
CAROLINE: You don't wonder what would have happened if Valerie would have shown up to meet you?
STEFAN: I don't wonder anymore. I don't care about the past. All I care about is that you're here, and you're safe. You're with me.
CAROLINE: I know...
VALERIE: 
OSCAR: 
VALERIE: A college town near Mystic Falls.
OSCAR: 
VALERIE: 
OSCAR: 
VALERIE: Hmmm. So, have you done your duty to the family and found Julian yet?
OSCAR: Can you keep a secret?
VALERIE: 
OSCAR: I found him months ago.
VALERIE: And you didn't tell Lily?
OSCAR: I didn't tell anyone. I wanted to... live a little before I came back.
VALERIE: ...And now that you're back?
OSCAR: 
VALERIE: I know you, Oscar. Eventually, you'll leverage Julian's location for your freedom from Lily.
OSCAR: Hmmm. Yeah, that's a... That's a pretty good idea. Yeah. Yeah, I'll probably do that.
