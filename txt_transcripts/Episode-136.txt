Never Let Me Go
I Carry Your Heart With Me







Contents

FLASH-FORWARD-- BROOKLYN, NEW YORK, 2016



TYLER: Hello?

STEFAN: 
 Tyler, it's Stefan. Have you spoken to Caroline?

TYLER: 
 No, and please don't ask me to. I have no desire to get mixed up in your drama with her.

STEFAN: 
 Listen to me-- my scar opened up. I don't have much time. I need you to warn Caroline. She's not taking my calls.




TYLER: Okay, I'm on it. But you should be running.

STEFAN: I'm way ahead of you. Take care of yourself, Tyler.



TITLE CARD & OPENING CREDITS

PRESENT DAY-- WHITMORE COLLEGE / ALARIC'S APARTMENT, 2013



BONNIE: 
 Dear Elena... Not to dive into the bad news first, but there's a severe drought of good news lately. And, well... this sort of concerns you. Lily's hiding your coffin somewhere. She promised to keep you safe as long as Damon stays out of Mystic--










DAMON: You seen my phone?

ALARIC: I've, uh, seen your empties, your dinner...




ALARIC: Your razor.




ALARIC: You know, some clothes would be nice.




DAMON: Got it!

ALARIC: 
 How long are you planning on crashing here, Damon? You know, you could compel yourself a whole sorority house if you wanted to.

DAMON: 
 And miss this Odd Couple squalor? I'm starting to enjoy the luxury of having one barely-functional shower-head after years of being tortured by the four that I have in my actual home.




DAMON: Relax! It's just 'til we hunt down Lily's lone-wolf Heretic and swap him out for my girlfriend in a coma.

ALARIC: 
 Yeah? And, uh, how long until that happens, huh?




DAMON: Pretty soon, thanks to Donovan. A phrase no one has uttered... ever.




DAMON: He's checking Lily's cell phone records.




DAMON: Hi, Bon-Bon!




BONNIE: Please tell me I'm not interrupting something...

ALARIC: 
 Oh, trust me-- you're not. What's up?

BONNIE: That Phoenix Stone that I touched yesterday... you did destroy it like you promised me, correct?

ALARIC: 
 Why? What happened?

BONNIE: I just had another vision-- a flash of horrified people with x-shaped wounds on their skin. And, when I opened my eyes, ten minutes had gone by.




ALARIC: The stone's gone. I, you know, watched in dissolve in hydrofluoric acid.

BONNIE: 
 You're positive?

ALARIC: 
 Bonnie, the stone's gone.




DAMON: Who wants to go to Myrtle Beach?

BONNIE: I'm busy.

ALARIC: 
 Pass.

DAMON: Well, that's too bad, because Lily made a bunch of phone calls that bounced off a cell tower there, and something tells me she's not making plans for her spring break.

BONNIE: 
 Why would Lily send one of her Heretics to Myrtle Beach?

DAMON: Tell you what-- you ask him yourself after he's safe in my car's trunk, hmmm? So, anyone up for an old-fashioned hostage-swap?

ALARIC: Does agreeing to go mean you putting on pants?




DAMON: I'll even give you shotgun!

SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE / MYSTIC GRILL



STEFAN: 
 Valerie was like a breath of fresh air. I'd been suffocating, and hadn't even realized it...





CAROLINE: 
 UGH! Thanks, Nora and Mary Louise! Real classy.




CAROLINE: I hate you both.




CAROLINE: Hello?

STEFAN: 
 Caroline?

CAROLINE: 
 Stefan!?

STEFAN: How are you on my phone right now?

CAROLINE: You must have dropped it when you got threshold-vacuumed out of here yesterday.

STEFAN: 
 How are you? Are you okay?

CAROLINE: Well, I'm spelled into your room by a menagerie of mean girls, but other than that...

STEFAN: 
 I know. I'm still trying to figure out a way to get into the house.

CAROLINE: I'll be fine. Just keep Damon from killing any more Heretics.

STEFAN: I will. Lily's only keeping you there to turn me against Damon. I'll convince her that I hate his guts, and she'll have made her point.




CAROLINE: Who's Valerie Tulle? You wrote about her in your journal from 1863. She must have found a copy in the prison world.

STEFAN: 
 Are you talking about one of the Heretics?

CAROLINE: Yeah. Dirty-blonde hair, blue eyes? She's one of my new psycho housemates...




CAROLINE: 
 UGH!

STEFAN: 
 Caroline?

VALERIE: Dirty-blonde hair, blue eyes, psycho. Summarized me to a tee!





MYSTIC GRILL



STEFAN: Caroline?




STEFAN: You can take my town, you can destroy my house, but you will not touch my car.




LILY: Good morning, Stefan.

STEFAN: 
 What are you doing?

LILY: I was out practicing my driving and saw an opportunity to work on my parallel parking.




LILY: I must have run over a nail or something. The streets around here are a disgrace.

STEFAN: Listen-- you need to tell those spoiled brats living in my house to stop torturing Caroline.

LILY: 
 Of course. As soon as you tell your brother to stop killing said spoiled brats.




STEFAN: Damon and I aren't really speaking right now.

LILY: 
 Really?

STEFAN: 
 I have no idea where he is. Apparently, you did both of us a favor when you told him to leave town.




LILY: Then I will give a lecture to the girls on their manners.

STEFAN: 
 Is one of those girls named Valerie Tulle?

LILY: 
 I was wondering when you might put those pieces together. I knew Valerie years before you did. She worked in my TB ward. After I turned, I took her under my wing. If memory serves me, you didn't meet her until 1863.

STEFAN: 
 How would you know that I met her?

LILY: Because, Stefan... I sent her to you.



FLASHBACK—MYSTIC FALLS COUNTY FAIR, 1863



VALERIE: You have to move.

STEFAN: 
 Excuse me?

VALERIE: 
 Your sad mood is spoiling the fun for everyone!




VALERIE: I'm Valerie Tulle.

STEFAN: Stefan Salvatore. Are you new to town?

VALERIE: Just passing through.

STEFAN: 
 I hope not too fast.



END FLASHBACK

PRESENT DAY-- SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



CAROLINE: Ohhh....




VALERIE: How do you have this?

CAROLINE: 
 Nora gave it to me. What was the deal with you and Stefan?




VALERIE: Wouldn't you like to know?




CAROLINE: 
 You know what? You're right. I'm already in enough pain. The last thing I need to think about is some girl who batted her eyelashes at Stefan, like, a million years ago.

VALERIE: 
 "Some girl?" I wasn't just some girl to him, Caroline. I was the first love of Stefan's life.

MYSTIC GRILL



STEFAN: Why did you send Valerie to me?

LILY: To check on you. Like any mother longing for her children, I was in a black hole of depression.




LILY: Yes, Stefan, I'm more than the cold-hearted snake you and your brother wish me to be. It took me a long time to get over losing you.




LILY: Anyway, I had been invited to travel to Europe with a... a vampire gentleman-friend of mine, but I refused to leave until I knew that my boys were okay.

STEFAN: 
 Heh. A gentleman-friend? You had a boyfriend?

LILY: His name was Julian.




LILY: What? You're acting as if that's absurd.

STEFAN: Well, your first husband shot and killed his own sons, so you'll have to excuse me if I don't trust your type.




LILY: Julian was nothing like your father.

STEFAN: 
 No? What was he? A nebbishy banker? Town butcher, perhaps?

LILY: 
 Julian was the man you are not supposed to fall for. So, of course, I did...

FLASHBACK-- MYSTIC FALLS COUNTY FAIR, 1863



JULIAN: For the soldiers!




JULIAN: Have your tickets ready, ladies! The men on the battlefield need us!




JULIAN: 
 Hello.




VALERIE: You have to hold still! It will be delicious, I promise.




JULIAN: Oh, ho ho ho! Aren't we lady-like?




VALERIE: Stefan... Meet Julian.




STEFAN: Your daughter and I were just appreciating the scientific wonder of gravitational force!




JULIAN: Hmm. How wise you must sound to less intelligent men.




VALERIE: Julian is not my father.

STEFAN: 
 Oh, uh, my apologies! I just assumed--

JULIAN: 
 Incorrectly, as it turns out.




JULIAN: Valerie, darling-- a word?




VALERIE: 
 Ugh, you're wrinkling my dress, Julian!

JULIAN: 
 What are you doing?

VALERIE: Lily sent us here to get a sense of his mood...

JULIAN: Exactly. His mood, not his manhood. Remember, his mother gave very strict instructions for us to keep our distance. Do not displease her.




VALERIE: I have everything under control.

END FLASHBACK

PRESENT DAY-- SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



VALERIE: I was lying. I wasn't prepared for how taken I was with him. He was gorgeous and sweet...




CAROLINE: And that's when you compelled him to write all those nice things about you in his journal. Spoiler! I've heard this story before, when a sweet, little orphan girl named Katherine Pierce waltzed into his life.

VALERIE: 
 I suppose that would have been easier had I actually had the ability to compel people. I wasn't a vampire back then. I was just a witch, rejected from her coven for being an abomination of nature because I had no power of my own. The only magic I had was contained in an amulet, to be siphoned in times of need.


FLASHBACK—MYSTIC FALLS COUNTY FAIR, 1863



STEFAN: I have a brother who's away at war, a father who judges me for not joining him, and a mother who was strong and kind. She died when I was ten.




VALERIE: I'm so sorry.

STEFAN: 
 Oh, it was a long time ago.

VALERIE: 
 There's no shame in missing her. A man on the outside with the heart of a boy? There are worse things.




STEFAN: 
 Your chaperon is... quite persistent.




VALERIE: Then we shall elude him!




VALERIE: Come.

STEFAN: 
 What are you doing?




VALERIE: 
 Invisique.




STEFAN: How did he not see us?

VALERIE: 
 Would you believe me if I said magic?



END FLASHBACK

PRESENT DAY—SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



CAROLINE: And then...?

VALERIE: 
 None of your business!




CAROLINE: I know why you put that burning spell on me. It's not so Mary Louise and Nora couldn't touch me. It's so Stefan wouldn't. Be more obvious.

VALERIE: Well, since you're so curious... Please, allow me to continue.


FLASHBACK—MYSTIC FALLS WOODS, 1863



STEFAN: Julian is going to kill me.

VALERIE: 
 Just compliment the whiteness of his teeth. He'll forget all about it.




VALERIE: Is something wrong?

STEFAN: 
 No, no. It's just that I've never...




STEFAN: Do you mind if I...?



END FLASHBACK

PRESENT DAY—SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE
[Caroline looks stunned and a little upset after learning the details of their affair, but Valerie expression is smug

VALERIE: It was his first time. I'm sure you've been someone's first, so you know what it's like to have a completely unforgettable place in someone else's mind.




CAROLINE: ...Of course.




VALERIE: That's what I thought.



MYRTLE BEACH HOTEL



ALARIC: Okay, so... what's the plan?

DAMON: Okay-- fair trade. One Heretic in good condition for the coffin housing Elena.

ALARIC: 
 No, I meant the plan where we try to capture a powerful Heretic who'd prefer we were dead.

DAMON: 
 Easy!




DAMON: B-Town stuns him with magic, you shoot him with vervain, I--




DAMON: --Snap his neck.

BONNIE: Yeah, but after we get him to siphon away my visions.

ALARIC: 
 Wait, what?

BONNIE: 
 Well, the visions are magic. He's a Siphon. It's worth a shot, right?




DAMON: Any other suggestions of how we can rid Bonnie of this mysterious pain she's in, Ric?




DAMON: Room service! Free shrimp!




OSCAR: Hey, you folks have the wrong... Holy--!




OSCAR: Damon Salvatore!

DAMON: 
 You know me...?

OSCAR: Of course I know you! It's good to see you're well, old friend. Come here, man!




DAMON: Hey, all right...




OSCAR: Haha! Come in, come in!




OSCAR: Uh, you caught me in the middle of a seventy-two hour social gathering...




OSCAR: Ahhh... Make yourself at home!




OSCAR: Uh, friend with the vervain gun? If you could holster that, I sure would feel a lot more comfortable.




BONNIE: How do you know Damon?

OSCAR: 
 Oh, he's Lily's son! The hero soldier. We... We met at a bar near Gettysburg, July of 1863.




OSCAR: Nothing?

DAMON: 
 I go to a lot of bars.




OSCAR: Heh, right, right, right. Uh, well, your mom was going through a rough patch. She could not move on until she knew her boys were okay, so she sent me out to find you.

DAMON: 
 My mother abandoned her family and ran for the hills. She doesn't give a flying crap about me.

OSCAR: 
 I sense hostility, and that's fine.




OSCAR: All emotions are valid and welcome here. But, it's the truth. She just wanted to know you were happy, Damon. She loved you.




OSCAR: Hey, you guys, what can I get you? Cocktail? Joint?




OSCAR: Jenny?

DAMON: 
 Does my mom know you're here?




OSCAR: Hey, hey, hey! Shhhh! Hahahahaha!




MYSTIC FALLS ROADS



STEFAN: No, no, no! Keep the car on this side of the road!




LILY: Valerie never told me about your romance...

STEFAN: Well, Valerie never told me that you were alive.

LILY: 
 Would it have mattered?

STEFAN: 
 Is that a real question?




LILY: She told me that you'd forgotten all about me. She said you had moved on. That... That was the only way I was able to move on, as well.

STEFAN: My mother was practically ripped out of my arms and sent to a TB ward. You don't move on from that. You find distractions.

FLASHBACK-- MYSTIC FALLS WOODS, 1863



STEFAN: Come with me. I want to show you something.




VALERIE: 
 Heh, this is romantic.

STEFAN: This is my mother's grave.




STEFAN; I come here every day to replace the flowers. She's been dead for six years, but I'm still trying to make up for my failure.

VALERIE: 
 What do you mean by that?

STEFAN: 
 She had consumption. One day, her coughing would not stop. My father sent me to go buy some flowers to make an herbal tonic. I ran to town as fast as I could, but by the time I got home with the flowers, she had been taken to the sanatorium.

VALERIE: 
 You never got to say goodbye...

STEFAN: 
 She died in the TB ward shortly after.




STEFAN: I always wonder what would have happened if I had just been able to run a little faster. The tonic would have helped her. She could have lived.




VALERIE: Were these the kind of flowers you were sent for?

STEFAN: Yes. Cream...

VALERIE: Cream violets.




VALERIE: That tonic would not have saved her.

STEFAN: 
 That's... That's very kind of you, but you cannot be certain.

VALERIE: But I am. I worked in a sanatorium, caring for patients who were just like your mother. Cream violets have no medicinal properties. It's an old wives' tale.




VALERIE: Your father sent you on a fool's errand. You were only ten. He... probably wanted you out of the house to make it easier on himself.




VALERIE: No matter what, you couldn't have saved your mother. Her death is not your fault.




JULIAN: Time to say goodbye.




JULIAN: I expected you would visit here sooner or later.

STEFAN: 
 Sir, if you would just let me explain...

JULIAN: We are leaving for New York now.

VALERIE: 
 I did not mean to disobey you--

JULIAN: 
 It was not me who you disobeyed. Come with me now, and we will speak no more of it. The carriage awaits.




STEFAN: When will I see you again?




VALERIE: I will find my way back to you. I promise.

PRESENT DAY-- SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



CAROLINE: 
 So, it was kind of like The Notebook, except you two never reconnect, and he totally forgot about you.

VALERIE: 
 Julian was in a hurry to get back to Europe. He convinced me to lie to Lily, to tell her that Stefan was happy. Believe me, Julian had a way of convincing anyone to do anything.

MYRTLE BEACH HOTEL



ALARIC: So, why did Lily send you here?

OSCAR: 
 She didn't send me here, exactly... She had a job, and I volunteered. And she has the family on a short leash back home, with this whole, "I took you in as orphans, so I know what's best for you"-vibe. Nooooo, thank you.




OSCAR: You know you can get a drink served to you in a fishbowl here? Hahaha!




OSCAR: Oh, hey! The other day, I called a number on this card, and just like that, I had a girlfriend!

BONNIE: 
 ...It's called an escort service.




OSCAR: But she really got who I am, you know?




OSCAR: It was a beautiful human experience! And that's what I've discovered here... freedom. The bad trip inside that prison world has ended, my friends, and I am breathing in what my soul was craving: f-r-e-e-dom.




BONNIE: 
 Well, in the spirit of helping others with their freedom, I have a favor to ask you... You know, as a Siphoner.

OSCAR: 
 Huh?

DAMON: Let me translate for you-- my friends were playing with some mystical tool they didn't quite understand, and now Bonnie's chasing her own white rabbit around the farm...

OSCAR: 
 So, you want me to, what, siphon her problems away?




DAMON: Just think of it as one big magical toke!

OSCAR: 
 I don't... I don't really like to mix mediums, if you know what I mean?




DAMON: Siphon the damn visions, we don't tell Lily that we saw you avoiding whatever mission you were sent to do, and we'll call it a day.




OSCAR: Okay, then.




OSCAR: Come on.




OSCAR: Ready?

BONNIE: Yeah.




OSCAR: Where's the Phoenix Stone?




BONNIE: 
 Uh... How do you know about the Phoenix Stone?

OSCAR: 
 How do you know about the Phoenix Stone? What are you people up to?




OSCAR: 
 Espirimus paratis!







DAMON: Good news? Your visions are gone. Bad news? So's Oscar.




ALARIC: Ohhh...




ALARIC: He took the stone.

BONNIE: 
 Uh, how is that possible when you destroyed it, Ric?




DAMON: We need to find him right now.




BONNIE: Did you know he still had it?




DAMON: Aw, come on! I mean, yo-- I-- A litt--




DAMON: ...Kind of. Ric, tell her what happened.

BONNIE: 
 No, I'm asking you.




DAMON: ...I live with the guy! Guys... know stuff.

BONNIE: 
 You lied to me.

DAMON: 
 I didn't lie to you! Ric lied to you! I just kept my mouth shut.




DAMON: Wait! I'm not gonna be stuck in the middle of this. No, no-- you sort this out. I'm gonna go find our bargaining chip.




BONNIE: So the visions, the lost time, the crippling headaches... they don't mean anything? Doesn't it matter to you?




ALARIC: Oh, of course they matter! But bringing Jo back matters more.

BONNIE: You don't even know what this stone does... if it will work!

ALARIC: I was dead. Gone. And so were you, Bonnie. We came back. We got our second chance.

BONNIE: 
 We were on the Other Side, okay? It doesn't exist anymore.

ALARIC: 
 Look, Jo was the love of my life. And if there is even a 1% chance that this could work, I need to take it, no matter how dangerous or insane it may be. Because if I don't, I'm gonna spend the rest of my life wishing I had stayed dead.




MYSTIC FALLS ROADS / SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



STEFAN: No, no. Keep your eyes on the road.




STEFAN: Make a left here. It'll take us back into town.




LILY: Is there anything else you'd like to know?

STEFAN: No. I mean, it doesn't matter-- obviously, it was all a lie, right?

LILY: 
 What do you mean?

STEFAN: Well, Valerie was using me.

LILY: 
 No. No, Valerie wouldn't have hurt you, because that would have inadvertently hurt me as well.

STEFAN: 
 Hmm. did it ever occur to you that maybe Valerie doesn't give a crap about you, or anyone else?

LILY: 
 I don't believe that.

STEFAN: No? How about the part where she sent me a telegram saying she was coming back?

LILY: 
 She what?

STEFAN: She'd been gone a few months...


FLASHBACK—MYSTIC FALLS, 1863





VALERIE: 
 I promised I would find my way back to you. I long to be in your arms again.






STEFAN: 
 She said she wanted to run away with me. Her telegram said to meet her Friday at noon. Heh, I showed up two hours early.


VALERIE: 
 He waited and waited for me. With every passing footstep, he would turn, expecting to see me.





STEFAN: 
 I sat around all day like an idiot-- past sundown, after nightfall-- but she never showed up. So, yeah, I guess you could say I'm wondering what the whole point was.


END FLASHBACK




LILY: Surely you're not still angry with her...

STEFAN: 
 It was 150 years ago.





VALERIE: Eventually, he accepted that he'd been abandoned all over again, and then he walked home under the cold and distant stars.

CAROLINE: 
 How could you do that to him?




VALERIE: There was a change of plan. I'm done talking to you about this.




FLASHBACK-- NEW YORK HARBOR, USA, 1863



JULIAN: Slipping away before sunrise on the very day our ship leaves for England?




VALERIE: Let me pass! I'm not going.

JULIAN: 
 Yes, you are.




JULIAN: Because Lily will not travel anywhere without her precious little orphans, and it is imperative that I leave today.




JULIAN: Do I frighten you?

VALERIE: 
 No.

JULIAN: 
 Because I can hear your heart beating faster. Both of your hearts, in fact. Does Stefan Salvatore know that you are pregnant with his child?




PRESENT DAY-- MYRTLE BEACH HOTEL



DAMON: I lied. I do remember you. I was fighting for the South. It's not exactly a time I like to reminisce about in front of my friends.




OSCAR: Yeah, you had the same opinion back then. Hated everything your side believed in. Hey, you wanted to desert, but feared shaming your old man.

DAMON: 
 You compelled me to take sick leave. The next day, my entire regiment was slaughtered in Gettysburg. You saved my life.

OSCAR: 
 I couldn't compel you back then. All I did was talk to you, from one human to another. I told you to follow your heart. Now, it's my turn to desert. I don't want to be part of Lily's cavalry, okay? I-I don't want rules, or-or a chain of command. I just want to have fun.




OSCAR: You know what? A little extra piece of advice-- A lot of people want the Phoenix Stone. Mess with it, and you end up dead.

DAMON: 
 Full disclosure-- I don't care about the stone.

OSCAR: 
 Then why are you chasing me, man?

DAMON: Let's just say I'd like to cash you in for something way better.




OSCAR: 
 Aerodux motus!




BONNIE: 
 Phasmatos morsinus pyrox allum. Phasmatos morsinus pyrox allum.

OSCAR: AHHH!




BONNIE: Never lie to me again.




DAMON: Aw, my besties are buds again! Let's go make a deal.




SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



LILY: Is Valerie here?

CAROLINE: 
 I heard her leave the house. I guess torture makes her hungry.




LILY: Forgive me for prying, but I heard your mother died this last spring...

CAROLINE: 
 I just spent the day reliving Stefan's first time. I really don't feel like talking about my dead mother with my hostage taker, but thanks.

LILY: 
 I was simply curious about one's ability to heal after such a loss.

CAROLINE: 
 Well, you must have had a mother. I mean, even Mussolini had a mother.

LILY: Of course I had a mother.

CAROLINE: Then you know that love is different than any other kind of love.




CAROLINE: Stefan wrote about you all the time. You can read for yourself.




CAROLINE: Here.




CAROLINE: He loved you. He missed you.




LILY: Nora, remove the barrier spell, please.




LILY: As of this moment, Miss Forbes is no longer a prisoner.




CAROLINE: What, is this one of those mean-girl tricks?

LILY: No, it's a reward for Stefan's honesty. Go... before I change my mind.




CAROLINE: I don't know what made your heart grow four sizes today... but thanks.




MYSTIC FALLS HOSPITAL



VALERIE: 
 In the prison world, before we desiccated, I came here every day to think. I can see that sometimes you still do, as well. That's a comfort.




VALERIE: It's strange to be here with you... finally able to tell you the truth.


FLASHBACK—NEW YORK HARBOR, 1863



VALERIE: Please don't tell Lily.

JULIAN: 
 Well, you have your reasons for staying here, and I have mine for leaving. Whatever will we do?






VALERIE: 
 Julian solved his dilemma by beating me senseless, 'til I was nearly dead, and the other heartbeat inside me stopped. When I regained consciousness, I was on the ship to England. Lily said Julian had found me robbed and beaten on the street.





VALERIE: 
 She believed him, of course, and she healed me with her blood. Julian knew I could never tell Lily what he had done, because that also would have exposed my lies.





LILY: Thank you.




VALERIE: 
 She never would have forgiven me for having an affair with her son.





VALERIE: 
 I didn't want to live under Julian's thumb, so that night, as we crossed the Atlantic, I drew myself a bath, laced my tea with laudanum, and went quietly to sleep...





VALERIE: 
 But, I died with Lily's blood in my system... And, by virtue of pure happenstance, I became the first Heretic.


END FLASHBACK

PRESENT DAY—MYSTIC FALLS HOSPITAL



VALERIE: You don't know how sorry I am.... about everything.




VALERIE: 
 Maybe you never will.

ALARIC'S APARTMENT



BONNIE: So, what does a rock that makes you see screaming people have to do with reincarnation?

ALARIC: I don't know.




ALARIC: But, I've read that book already, cover-to-cover, and it's a waste of time.




ALARIC: In fact, all of these are a waste of time. They talk about resurrection, the phoenix rising from the ashes, but nothing about a stone that brings people back from the dead.




BONNIE: 
 Are you sure you understand what you're trying to do? It's not like Jo's spirit is behind a veil that we lift and she magically appears. This is necromancy.

ALARIC: 
 I want to show you something...

WHITMORE MEDICAL CENTER



ALARIC: The hospital can only preserve the body for a set amount of time. I've been paying off the tech to fake the logs.




ALARIC: Jo's still in there. She has to be.




BONNIE: Ric...

ALARIC: 
 I know what I'm getting myself into. I... I just can't do it alone. At least tell me you'll try.




BONNIE: ...I'll try.

WHITMORE MEDICAL CENTER / SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE



LILY: Damon.

DAMON: You should have come yourself.

LILY: 
 It's been a long day. I have little energy for your riddles.

DAMON: Gettysburg, 1863-- if that had been you, it would have changed the entire course of my life.

LILY: I was supposed to be dead.

DAMON: And I was supposed to be your son.

LILY: 
 How do you know this?

DAMON: Your prodigal Heretic was Fear and Loathing in the armpit of Myrtle Beach.

LILY: 
 Oscar...

DAMON: Don't worry, Mommy-- he's in the middle of a vervain detox. Give me Elena. Maybe I won't kill him.




LILY: You will not lay a hand on another member of my family.

DAMON: 
 You know, this whole "family" thing really irked me at first, but now, I get it. You loved me, time passed, and you moved on to another family.




DAMON: So did I. Why don't we end this mutual disdain once and for all? Give me Elena, you get your son back.




MYSTIC GRILL



STEFAN: 
 Caroline!




STEFAN: Ahhh!




STEFAN: How did you escape?

CAROLINE: I didn't. Lily let me go.

STEFAN: 
 She did?

CAROLINE: 
 Yeah... I guess today is just full of Valerie-sized surprises, huh?




STEFAN: Heh... Look, I was just a kid when I met her. Just a troubled boy mourning his dead mom. I was young and human.

CAROLINE: I was young and human when you and I met, and I remember the exact moment when I met you.




CAROLINE: And do you remember the first time that you ever saw me?




CAROLINE: I'm sorry. That was totally unfair. Just... please forget I asked. I mean, you were even sitting next to Elena, so of course you only had eyes for her...

STEFAN: Things have changed. Different circumstances, different results.

CAROLINE: 
 Here's a different circumstance-- Valerie's out of the prison world. Does that change things for you?




STEFAN: Of course not.

CAROLINE: You don't wonder what would have happened if Valerie would have shown up to meet you?

STEFAN: I don't wonder anymore. I don't care about the past. All I care about is that you're here, and you're safe. You're with me.




CAROLINE: I know...




WHITMORE MEDICAL CENTER



VALERIE: 
 You're awake.

OSCAR: 
 Awake and... coming down hard. Where the hell am I?

VALERIE: A college town near Mystic Falls.

OSCAR: 
 Did Lily send you?

VALERIE: 
 Lily has no idea where you are. I used a locator spell.

OSCAR: 
 Maybe I can turn this thing around before she gets in the loop.




VALERIE: Hmmm. So, have you done your duty to the family and found Julian yet?

OSCAR: Can you keep a secret?

VALERIE: 
 You have no idea.

OSCAR: I found him months ago.

VALERIE: And you didn't tell Lily?

OSCAR: I didn't tell anyone. I wanted to... live a little before I came back.

VALERIE: ...And now that you're back?

OSCAR: 
 I don't know, Val. I haven't exactly thought it through from my hostage bed, here...




VALERIE: I know you, Oscar. Eventually, you'll leverage Julian's location for your freedom from Lily.

OSCAR: Hmmm. Yeah, that's a... That's a pretty good idea. Yeah. Yeah, I'll probably do that.




VALERIE: 
 Hmmm. You have a sweet soul, Oscar, and you've been good to me, like a brother.




VALERIE: 
 But Julian is the devil. I can't let Lily bring him back.
