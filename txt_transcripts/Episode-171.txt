SELINE: When that bell rings 12 times, the the hellfire it unleashes, wipes out everything for miles.
MATT: In this case all of us in Mystic Falls.
DAMON: I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride, little brother.
BONNIE: We're okay. Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it.
ENZO: I think they're siphoning directly from you.
BONNIE: But I don't have any magic.
ENZO: Of course you do, luv.
DAMON: If Cade's not running hell, who is?
BONNIE: The one who wants revenge for what we did to her.
DAMON: Katherine.
DORIAN: See, if Katherine's back, that means hell still exists.
BONNIE: Maybe there's a way to destroy the dimension itself. Destroying hell destroys her.
KELLY: She's gonna burn down Mystic Falls with hellfire.
MATT: Even if Katherine rings the bell, she can't create hellfire. Only someone from the Maxwell bloodline can do that. Dad's not gonna do it and neither am I.
KELLY: Oh, then it's a good thing you weren't an only child.
DAMON: Except Vicki's dead.
KELLY: She was, Until my son opened up a portal to hell.
STEFAN: Bonnie.
CAROLINE: Bonnie. What happened?
STEFAN: The magic was too much for her.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: No, no, no, no, no.
CAROLINE: Oh, my God. No.
STEFAN: Don't do this. Bonnie. Come on, Bonnie.
ELENA: Bonnie?
BONNIE: Elena. Elena!
ELENA: Hi!
BONNIE: Hi! 
ELENA: No. No, wait. This isn't how it's supposed to be. No. You can't die. Not yet. You have to live and, and grow old and have children, and grandchildren.
BONNIE: I'm okay. I can be with Enzo now.
ELENA: No, this is wrong.
BONNIE: Elena. I'm ready.
ENZO: Well, I'm not.
BONNIE: Enzo.
ENZO: Sorry, luv, but it's not your time.
STEFAN: Hey.
BONNIE: I saw her. I saw Elena.
DAMON: Sorry. Can't let you do that.
VICKI: I'm sorry. But there's nothing you can do to stop me.
MATT: Where is she?
DAMON: She went splat.
MATT: You threw her out the window?
DAMON: You are aware that she's already dead.
MATT: Damon!
DAMON: Don't "Damon" me. In fact, don't say anything at all. Katherine Pierce just declared war, and I need a clear head.
VICKI: Was that really necessary?
MATT: Vicki.
VICKI: You're a dick. You can't stop me. This is my ticket out of hell, and I'm taking it. Katherine is gonna save-
MATT: Damon!
DAMON: Relax. Just testing a theory. Wait for it.
DAMON: Yep, she's deader than a doornail.
VICKI: And I'll just keep coming back, again and again.
DAMON: You need to convince her to stop ringing this bell. You understand me? Fate of Mystic Falls lies with you and your family, so get on it.
MATT: And where are you going?
DAMON: Anticipating your failure, so it's kind of dumb to stick around. I have things to do.
MATT: I can't believe you're here.
VICKI: I can't do the emotional reunion, Matt. I love you, and I'm sorry, but Katherine told me to ring this bell every five minutes until Mystic Falls burns. You should save yourself, that's what I'm doing.
MATT: Vick, this is our home.
VICKI: This is your home. This town means nothing to me.
MATT: You're gonna believe Katherine Pierce? She's a liar!
VICKI: I can't go back there. You don't know what it's like. At least this way, when I die, I'll just be dead.Gone. And I'm okay with that.
STEFAN: There has to be something.
DAMON: The only chance we've got is if Donovan can somehow convince his train wreck of a sister hell ain't so bad.
CAROLINE: There he is. Matt!
MATT: Yeah, it's Sheriff Donovan. Activate the evacuation protocol. Gas leak. Yeah, again.
STEFAN: There's got to be something we're missing.
DAMON: Nope. Katherine won. She played the long game and finally beat us. 
STEFAN: Earlier, Bonnie's heart stopped.She said she saw Elena.
KATHERINE: Damon?
DAMON: Elena.
KATHERINE: 
DAMON: Bonnie's okay. You're both okay.
KATHERINE: 
DAMON: You're awake. 
KATHERINE: Rude.
STEFAN: You got to be kidding me. Katherine.
KATHERINE: Hello, brothers. 
DAMON: Where's Elena?
KATHERINE: Dead. A spiritual coma, if we're getting technical.
STEFAN: Her physical body. Where is it?
KATHERINE: That's for me to know, and for you to dot, dot, dot. I hope you enjoyed the little show I put on for you.It's been a hoot watching you take on the devil. 
DAMON: Damn it, Katherine. Where is she?
KATHERINE: It really is the perfect revenge. At 10:00 p.m., Mystic Falls will burn, precious Elena will burn and I'm guessing one of you two Salvatores are going down with her. Should I place my bets now? 
DAMON: Well, that shut her up.
STEFAN: We're running out of time. We have to find Elena. Let's go.
GRANDFATHER: Where's my granddaughter? Where's Tiki?
MATT: Dad!
PETER: Matt! I heard the bell. And then when they said we had to evacuate
MATT: I need you to get in a van so they can transport you to Grove Hill.
PETER: Wait, but if you're not the one ringing the bell, then then what's the problem?
MATT: It's Vicki, Dad.
PETER: What?
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Have you tried the high school?
STEFAN: That's my next stop.
CAROLINE: Okay, I'll meet you there.
STEFAN: Okay.
ALARIC: Bonnie's in the car with the girls.
CAROLINE: I grabbed the baby books. Do we need anything else?
ALARIC: Everything else is replaceable. Let's go.
CAROLINE: Listen, I need you to go ahead. I'm gonna stay here and help Stefan.
ALARIC: Help Stefan do what?
CAROLINE: Katherine has taken Elena's body, so I'm going to help them find it.
ALARIC: No. No, Caroline.
CAROLINE: You know Damon won't leave this town without her.
ALARIC: Well, that is not your problem.
CAROLINE: It's Elena, Ric, and they need me.
ALARIC: Your girls need you.
CAROLINE: They have you. Okay? Just Come on. Get them to the Armory, I'll meet you there. I promise. 
ALARIC: Okay, Bonnie's in the car with the girls.
CAROLINE: I grabbed the baby books. Do we need anything else?
ALARIC: Everything else is replaceable. Let's go.
CAROLINE: Listen, I need you to go ahead. I'm gonna stay here and help Stefan.
ALARIC: Help Stefan do what?
CAROLINE: Katherine has taken Elena's body, so I'm going to help them find it.
ALARIC: No, no Caroline.
CAROLINE: You know Damon won't leave this town without her.
ALARIC: Well, this is not your problem.
CAROLINE: It's Elena, Ric, and they need me.
ALARIC: Your girls need you.
CAROLINE: They have you. Okay? Just... Come on, get them to the Armory, I'll meet you there. I promise.
ALARIC: No. I don't need to remind you what it's like to lose your mother. Don't make me have to tell those girls you died because you put somebody else before them.
CAROLINE: You won't have to. I'll get out of here safely. I promise.
STEFAN: Come on, let's get you out of here. 
OFFICER: Come on, keep it moving! This way, this way.
DAMON: The boiler room? There is a horror movie reference in there somewhere, but it escapes me.
STEFAN: I'm fine, but she's trapped. We're running out of time. You have to get Katherine to break the spell.
DAMON: I'm all over it.
KATHERINE: Need something?
DAMON: You're like a bad penny.
KATHERINE: Funny thing about that bone dagger, it sends me to hell, but it can't keep me there.
DAMON: I'm sorry.
KATHERINE: Oh, and if you want to know how to get Elena free, you can't. Kai Parker was kind enough to set that trap for me, and, if I'm not mistaken, he's forever indisposed.
DAMON: After 153 odd years, this banter that we have is just old. So, why don't we just skip to the part where you tell me what you want and we'll negotiate.
KATHERINE: I have everything I want, Damon, or I'm about to. Once that last bell rings, this stupid town will go up in flames and everybody will go "poof". Well, they'll burn alive first, but then their ashes will go poof.
DAMON: You know, petty doesn't look good on a woman your age, Katherine.
KATHERINE: Oh, I'm not being petty. I'm gloating.
DAMON: No, you're jealous of Elena. Because you know that Stefan and I both would choose her over you every time.
KATHERINE: And she would choose Stefan.
DAMON: What makes you so sure of that?
KATHERINE: Because I would, any woman would. Stefan is the better man.
CAROLINE: Kai spelled her in. She can't get out.
BONNIE: We're too far away. Can't get back in time to help.
CAROLINE: What are we supposed to do? I can't leave Elena here.
STEFAN: It's not just Elena.
BONNIE: What do you mean? You know Damon won't leave her here to die alone.
ALARIC: You need to head out now, Caroline. Take the tunnels, it'll be faster for you.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: I need to talk to Damon.
CAROLINE: Do you think you'll convince him?
STEFAN: No. But I have to try.
CAROLINE: I made a promise to Ric... that I wouldn't risk the girls growing up without a mother. So I can help you with Damon, but I can't -
STEFAN: No. I can do it alone. You get to safety. Family first.
CAROLINE: We're family now. Okay? You and me and the girls. It's just please, please, 
STEFAN: If I want to convince Damon I have to move fast, and I can't do that unless I know you're safe.
CAROLINE: No.
STEFAN: He's my brother.
CAROLINE: Family first.
STEFAN: I love you so much.
CAROLINE: I love you too. 
ALARIC: All right, girls. Why don't you go change your dresses, okay?
BONNIE: You okay?
ALARIC: It's not that I don't care, you know? I care about Elena.
BONNIE: It's okay, Ric. I understand.
ALARIC: And I care about Damon.
BONNIE: He knows you do.
ALARIC: I don't want to fail them. But I can't fail my daughters. And they need their mother.
BONNIE: Look, if there was something we could do, we would do it. 
ALARIC: Oh, that is "Project Hail-Mary". Dorian and I were trying to find a way to destroy Cade's hell. We figured we needed a few million volts of mystical energy, just give or take. That kinda took the wind out of our sails.
BONNIE: Like the kind of energy contained in hellfire?
STEFAN: 
BONNIE: Listen, Stefan, I know I've been hard on you, but I also know that you and I are equally willing to do anything we can to fix this.
STEFAN: Absolutely. Why? Do you have something?
BONNIE: I think I do. But the only way it gets rid of Katherine Pierce is if she's in hell when I destroy it. That's where it gets tricky.
STEFAN: Tell me what I need to do.
MATT: All right guys, keep on moving. Everybody out. 
BONNIE: I need to thank you for what you did earlier tonight in the fire.
JOSIE: We saved you.
BONNIE: Yeah, you did. And not just that, you made me realize that I had all the magic I ever needed right inside me. 
CAROLINE: 
ALARIC: Listen, we have to leave quickly. I'll explain everything in the car to you, okay? Come on, girls, run to the car. Run to the car.
BONNIE: I'm gonna save the world. And you need to get in that car and drive away.
CAROLINE: But, I don't... Bonnie.
ALARIC: Caroline, I'm so sorry but we have to go.
BONNIE: Ric will fill you in. I love you.
CAROLINE: Just don't do anything stupid, Bonnie Bennett.
BONNIE: I'll be fine. Promise.
KATHERINE: Taking a trip down memory lane? Oh, I've missed this place, said no one ever.
DAMON: I figured you'd keep showing up to annoy me. You're nothing, if not utterly predictable.
KATHERINE: And miss a minute of the Elena Gilbert show? Speaking of which, shouldn't you be by her side?
DAMON: Well, I figured now that you're practically the devil, you'd be in the know. I just hung out with Bonnie Bennett and she figured out a way to save the day.
KATHERINE: Bonnie isn't strong enough to save a kitten.
DAMON: She's done it once or twice, my money's on her.
KATHERINE: We're talking about hell fire so intense it could obliterate anything within miles. What the hell is Bonnie gonna do? She's thirty minutes away.
DAMON: If you take the highway round the mountain, sure, but as the crow flies it's only seven miles, which is the beauty of these tunnels. Did you know that they go from The Armory straight into the heart of downtown Mystic Falls? I bet you didn't know that, did you?
KATHERINE: You think Bonnie Bennett can magically draw hell fire through the tunnels away from the town?
DAMON: Even better. I think she can send it straight back to hell, where you and I will be waiting patiently for it. I've gotta say, I look forward to dying by your side, KP.
KATHERINE: You're bluffing.
STEFAN: No, he's not. 
DAMON: I've got this handled, bro. You need to get out of these tunnels.
STEFAN: I'm not the one who's going to get out of here, Damon. You are.
DAMON: Bad time to be a martyr, Stefan.
STEFAN: Said the martyr.
KATHERINE: I'm gonna let you two figure this out amongst yourselves.
DAMON: Fine. Then we'll both go.
STEFAN: Somebody needs to stay here to make sure she's actually in hell when it's destroyed.
DAMON: I'm aware, Stefan. Tell Elena that I did this for her, to pay for my past mistakes.
STEFAN: You can tell her yourself. I need to do this, Damon. I owe it to Bonnie and Enzo. I owe it to a lot of people.
DAMON: I'm not gonna leave you to die here, Stefan.
STEFAN: Yes, you are.
DAMON: Are you seriously gonna sit here and argue with me about who needs this redemption more? You're not responsible for Enzo, Stefan!
STEFAN: You keep saying that, but you're wrong. We're all responsible for our own actions. Every drop of blood that I've spilled, I am accountable for.
DAMON: Then I'm accountable too and I've spilled even more.
STEFAN: Damon, I'm human. In sixty years I'm gonna be old, I'm gonna be dead. You have quite literally an eternity with Elena ahead of you.
DAMON: Which means a lot less without you.
STEFAN: Do you think I want this? I just got married. My wife is out there waiting for me to come home to her. In the nearly two centuries since I made you become a vampire, I have fought to turn you into the man who deserves the happiness that's out there right now.
DAMON: No.
STEFAN: Just let me do this for you.
DAMON: No.
STEFAN: Then let me do this for me. Please.
DAMON: I love you, little brother.
STEFAN: I love you too.
DAMON: Then you're right. You are human. Which is why I can do this. 
STEFAN: No, Damon, don't.
DAMON: You walk out of these tunnels and you are not going to stop until my death breaks the compulsion, because I am the big brother. I'm sorry I wasn't better at it until now. I said go. GO!
PETER: Vicki?
VICKI: Daddy?
PETER: Hi, honey.
VICKI: 
PETER: I'm not here to talk you out of it.
VICKI: Oh, well that's rich. Why'd you come to watch me blow myself into oblivion?
MATT: Vicki. Bonnie has a plan.
VICKI: I am not gonna stop ringing this bell.
PETER: We don't need you to stop.
VICKI: 
PETER: I just wanted to see my daughter one last time.
Caroline: Tell me what's going on.
Alaric: I don't know what to say, Caroline. Stefan, hes uh... he's made a decision.
BONNIE: Okay, Grams. If I ever needed you to hear me, hear me now.
BONNIE: Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moventur, ego ex vos, vos ex unos...
BONNIE: Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moventur, ego ex vos, vos ex unos...
CAROLINE: Stop the car. I said stop!
: Hi, this is Stefan. Leave your number.
CAROLINE: Stefan, please call me. Please. I need you to know that I understand. I love you. I will love you forever. I understand.
Bonnie: ... phasmatos incendia moventur, ego ex vos, vos ex unos, phasmatos incendia entrare! Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moventur, ego ex vos, vos ex unos, phasmatos incendia entrare!
DAMON: Poof.
BONNIE: Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moventur, ego ex vos, vos ex unos, phasmatos incendia entrare!!!
BONNIE: No. I can do this. I can do this. I can beat you. You can't have me. It's not my time.
ENZO: Now you're finally ready to live?
BONNIE: 
ENZO: Keep fighting, love.
BONNIE: It's too strong. I can't do it alone.
ENZO: Nonsense, you are strong enough to do anything you put your mind to. And love, you're not alone.
BONNIE: Grams.
BONNIE: Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moveo...
BEATRICE: Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moveo. Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moveo.
WITCHES: Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moveo. Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moveo. Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moveo!!
BONNIE: I did it.
STEFAN: Hi.
ELENA: Hi. What happened? Why am I here right now?
STEFAN: I don't know about Bonnie, but Damon... Damon wanted to sacrifice everything, to save you. To save this town. He was ready. I'm human now. He compelled me to leave. 
ELENA: I don't understand.
DAMON: Not long now, demon spawn. I can hear that fire coming back this way.
KATHERINE: You love this, don't you?
DAMON: You have no idea.
STEFAN: I gave him my blood. The cure.
ELENA: You what?
STEFAN: Without the cure I'd start to age. I'd be dead soon enough.
ELENA: So Damon's okay?
STEFAN: He's okay.
ELENA: But you, you're...?
STEFAN: I did what I had to do.
KATHERINE: No, no, Stefan. Please.
STEFAN: Burn in hell. 
ELENA: No. Stefan.
STEFAN: Tonight I saw a side of Damon that I hadn't seen in a while. The older brother I looked up to. The son who enlisted in the Civil War to please his father. The Damon I knew when I was a boy. I wanted that Damon to live. And I wanted you to have an opportunity to get to know him. He's the better man. He's the right man. 
LEXI: Wow. That was beautiful.
STEFAN: I was feeling epic.
ELENA: Dear Diary, today will be different. Today I will smile. It will be genuine. Because today is that day that I get to live again.
BONNIE: Here she is.
ELENA: Am I?
BONNIE: I did it. I broke the spell.
ELENA: How?
BONNIE: It took some time, but I think I've finally figured this witch thing out.
ELENA: Where is he?
BONNIE: He's with Caroline. Saying goodbye.
ELENA: 
DAMON: 
CAROLINE: Peace? I do. We'll see him again.
DAMON: You'll see him again. Me, I'm going the other way. They'll probably reopen hell for me.
CAROLINE: Don't be so sure.
ELENA: I need you to know that Stefan said something to me before we parted.
STEFAN: One day when you wake up, tell Caroline I heard her and I will love her forever too.
CAROLINE: He got my message.
ELENA: And life goes on.
MATT: Dear Diary, we survived that night. Mystic Falls is safe. I remain the Sheriff. They even gave me a bench. I'm thinking of running for mayor and Vicki, well, I think she found peace. Somehow it feels like she did.
BONNIE: I'm determined to keep my promise to Enzo. I'm gonna live this life to the fullest. I wanna see the world. Enjoy my life. Do I have everything?
ENZO: Passport. Passport, nightstand.
ALARIC: As for my family, Caroline and I got what Damon decided was Stefan's last wish.
CAROLINE: Opening the school was hard work. We needed lots of help. Fortunately we knew plenty of people with experience. Here you go.
ALARIC: Caroline was determined to make it a success. She wanted to make her mum proud.
ALARIC: Plus, soon after the school opened, she got a most impressive donor. But that is the beginning of another story.
ELENA: After med school I came home to Mystic Falls. It felt right. It's where I wanted to grow old and, I did. And that's my life. Weird, messy, complicated, sad, wonderful, amazing and above all, epic. And I owe it all to Stefan. When I met him I had lost my parents and I was dead inside, but he brought me back to life and I'm going to live it as best I can, for as long as I can.
ELENA: Even after our long and happy life together, Damon is still worried he'll never see Stefan again. That he'll never find peace. But I know he's wrong, because peace exists. It lives in everything we hold dear.
ELENA: That is the promise of peace. That one day, after a long life, we find each other again.
STEFAN: Damon.
DAMON: Hello, brother.
