DAMON: 
DAMON: That's right. Dallas. The home of big hair and horrible presidents.
HUNTRESS: And the trap you just walked into. Unfortunately, you're not the fly I was hoping to catch.
DAMON: Oh, so, the mystery guest makes an appearance. Why don't you do me a favor? Come a little closer so I can sort of see you.
DAMON: Mom? It's been a long time.
DAMON: What's the plan?
STEFAN: Julian needs to die today. Everything has to appear to be normal. Julian's not an idiot. If he finds out that Lily turned on him, we're all dead.
ENZO: So you... embed her with a psychopath? Sounds logical.
DAMON: 
DAMON: But, hey, complicated plan "A" sounds like a happy compromise.
STEFAN: 
ENZO: 
JULIAN: That's it. Nora is off pancake duty.
NORA: Me? Haha! You're the one who wanted the chocolate chips to melt.
LOUISE: 
JULIAN: Mmm. Nobody's killing anybody before we eat. I'm not wasting any of this food.
NORA: Hahaha!
JULIAN: Oh! Darling. We woke you.
LILY: Aren't we having fun?
ENZO: Julian treats Lily's Heretics like they're his own royal children. And they worship him right back. They'll never turn on him.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Well, I guess the only way we're gonna be able to pull this off is to deploy the nuclear option.
ENZO: 
VALERIE: Me. I know how to win them over to our side.
ENZO: 
VALERIE: The truth.
LILY: This looks like quite the feast. What's the occasion?
LOUISE: Don't tell me you forgot.
LILY: 
NORA: It's our anniversary. Mary Lou and I have been together for 133 years.
JULIAN: Of course she remembered! In fact, it was Lily's idea to host your party tonight.
NORA: 
LOUISE: 
:15.
JULIAN: Girls, girls, girls, girls, you're underestimating us. I think they're in for a wonderful surprise, don't you, my love?
LILY: Yes! Yes, quite the surprise.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: Hey.
MATT: Breaking news-- remember all those people Julian was stockpiling? They disappeared this morning.
CAROLINE: That's weird. Where did they go?
MATT: That's what I'm working on. You want to cut class today and help me get to the bottom of it?
CAROLINE: Actually, I can't. I'm... 
MATT: Wait, you're really pregnant?
CAROLINE: 
MATT: How did Stefan take it?
CAROLINE: Oh, you know... totally supportive and just wanted to make sure that I was okay. At least, that's how I'm hoping it goes when I tell him today.
LILY: What are you doing here, Lorenzo?
ENZO: Oh, looking for the self-help section. Seems I've developed, um, feelings for someone with terrible taste, and yet... I can't seem to shake her.
LILY: I need something for Nora and Mary Lou's anniversary. Nora used to read this poem over and over again when we were trapped together. I believe it was called "The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd."
ENZO: Ah. "But could youth last and love still breed, had joys no date, nor age no need, then these delights my mind might move to live with thee and be thy love."
LILY: I had no idea you enjoyed poetry.
ENZO: Well, there's a lot about me that you haven't... allowed yourself to know.
ENZO: The poems of Sir Walter Raleigh, a proper Englishman. Oh, this looks like a decent edition...
ENZO: Do you really think some bauble will convince the Heretics to side with you over an evil step-daddy who spoils them rotten with ponies and ice cream?
LILY: 
ENZO: Yes, you do. Run. Leave town with me. Let your sons carry out their plan while you're off the grid.
LILY: Oh, Lorenzo... I can't run from this. This is my doing.
ENZO: 
ENZO: Come with me.
LILY: You know I can't do that.
ENZO: But if you could...
LILY: If I could...
ENZO: Good luck, Lily. You'll need it.
NORA: 
JULIAN: 
MARY: 
JULIAN: As you wish.
NORA: This is epic!
LOUISE: Who are all these people?
JULIAN: 
NORA: Heh. But there's so many!
JULIAN: I've been collecting them for this very occasion.
LOUISE: Are you ill? Lily would never allow this.
JULIAN: 
LILY: What is going on here?
JULIAN: Loosen up, darling! It's a party!
LILY: 
LILY: But where did all these people come from, Julian? They certainly didn't bus themselves in to be our dinner.
NORA: See? I told you she was incapable of fun. Come on. Let's go before she ruins our entire night.
LILY: However... I suppose, since it's a special occasion, we can make an exception.
JULIAN: See? Just like old times!
STEFAN: Damon! Lily just texted me their location. Let's do this!
STEFAN: Oh! Hi.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: I was, but I'm here now. Surprise! Heh.
DAMON: Ah. Stefan-distraction machine. Please tell me you're not coming.
CAROLINE: Coming where?
VALERIE: Nora and Mary Louise's anniversary.
CAROLINE: Great. You're here, too. That's... perfect. Um...
STEFAN: Uh, what are... what are you doing here?
CAROLINE: I'm... um....
DAMON: 
VALERIE: You know what? Damon and I will go together. Stefan can follow behind.
DAMON: 
VALERIE: Yes. Let's go.
STEFAN: Uh... What was that all about?
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: I know, it's insane. Magical baby transplants? I... I didn't believe it, either. But then I ate nine ice cream sundaes from noon to three, and none of my clothes fit, and then there was that whole part with the doctor and the ultrasound, so... Right. Yeah.
CAROLINE: You can say something...
STEFAN: Uh, I don't think there are any words...
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: I have to go.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: I mean, obviously we need to talk about this. Um... But we have this small window to get to Julian tonight, and this is sort of...
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: No, no, no, it's... I mean, yes, it... Yes, um... But we will talk about it when I get back.
CAROLINE: Okay...
STEFAN: Promise.
JULIAN: Where are you taking me?
LOUISE: Quiet! I need your opinion.
LOUISE: Do you think she'll say yes?
JULIAN: 
LOUISE: Why am I so nervous?
JULIAN: ...Probably because the love of your life is far too vain to be wearing whatever that tiny little rock is... reflecting light in that box.
LOUISE: 
JULIAN: 
JULIAN: This belonged to French royalty. A, uh, princess, I think. She was telling me as she lost her head...
LOUISE: It's perfect.
JULIAN: 
NORA: This is what I read to everyone in that horrible prison world...
LILY: I thought it'd be a nice anniversary gift. It reminds me of everything we've been through as a family.
NORA: Thank you, Lily. This is so special, I love it.
JULIAN: Guess who?
LILY: 
NORA: 
JULIAN: Dance with me.
LILY: I have no idea how to dance to this kind of music...
JULIAN: No, no, no, fear not. I bribed the DJ to play us a slow song.
JULIAN: Do you recognize it?
LILY: 
JULIAN: Not the arrangement, but perhaps the vocals?
LILY: I'll never forget that voice. He used to sing so beautifully.
JULIAN: To think of everything we've endured as a family... And now we're together, at long last.
LILY: Just like old times.
JULIAN: Well, almost like old times. You haven't been indulging in any of the real fun.
LILY: No, I'm perfectly content with blood bags.
JULIAN: No. No, you're afraid.
LILY: 
JULIAN: Going all in... and rejoining our family completely.
JULIAN: You keep holding onto the hope that Stefan and Damon will love you again, that we'll be one big happy family. But we can't. Hmm? And that hope is causing unwanted friction.
JULIAN: Take a look around! You have all the love that you need right here. All you have to do is accept it.
JULIAN: Come back to us, Lily. Let go and allow yourself to be the woman that I fought through hell for.
DAMON: Looks like someone's having fun.
LILY: I had to feed. I have to convince them that I'm on their side.
DAMON: 
DAMON: Plan's postponed till further notice.
LILY: No, no, no, no. Look, Valerie will get through to them. The plan must go forward. I can't spend another minute with that man.
DAMON: Fine. Julian dies tonight, but it's no skin off my back if you're still linked to the guy when I shove a stake through his heart.
LILY: Yes, you made that perfectly clear when you tried to kill him yesterday.
DAMON: 
LILY: I am your mother. How can you be so cavalier about my life?
DAMON: 
NORA: Mare, this is gorgeous! Did you do all this?
LOUISE: Mostly. Julian and Beau helped.
LOUISE: What's that?
NORA: A gift for us.
NORA: "But could youth last and love still breed, have joys no date, nor age no need..."
LOUISE: Marry me. 133 years is not enough, Nora. I want eternity.
NORA: Yes.
LOUISE: Heh! Really?
NORA: Yes. Of course, yes!
VALERIE: I'm happy for you two.
LOUISE: 
VALERIE: 
MATT: Hey! Let her go.
ENZO: Oh, so, so sorry, Officer. I found this one wandering about and assumed she was of, uh... drinking age.
MATT: What the hell is wrong with you?
ENZO: Well, let's just say I didn't get the girl.
ENZO: I don't think the life-saving business suits you, mate.
MATT: Yeah, why don't you tell that to the girl whose throat you were about to tear out?
ENZO: Mmm, yeah. Well, I suppose that brings your tally to a whopping one.
MATT: Damon didn't want you, Lily didn't want you, and this town never wanted you. So what are you still doing here?
ENZO: I might ask the same thing about you. The Heretics are throwing a murder-party in your precious hometown-- 
ENZO: You're over-matched. You've brought a knife to a gunfight, and it's gonna be the death of you.
LOUISE: 
VALERIE: This isn't about me. It's about our family.
NORA: Hold on. Where's Julian? We should wait for him.
LILY: Julian won't be joining us.
DAMON: Hell of a party.
JULIAN: Well, your mother would agree. There's a kindergarten teacher in the powder room to prove it.
STEFAN: Oh, good old Mom. Bet she made you think she enjoyed it, too, huh?
VALERIE: His face went cold. I couldn't fight him off. I couldn't... I couldn't stop him. Julian beat me savagely and... when it was finally over, my baby was dead.
VALERIE: Murdering my child wasn't just some violent whim. It was a calculated, manipulative act.
JULIAN: What are you boys doing here?
DAMON: It's an anniversary party! Guess we figured we'd come support the pretty one and her mean girlfriend. Hmm?
LOUISE: 
LILY: Me. I would have never gone to Europe with him had I known about my grandchild.
NORA: 
LILY: Stefan was the baby's father.
VALERIE: I couldn't cope. I took my own life and became the first Heretic. And when Julian saw how powerful I was, he wanted more. We're his army. We're not his family. We always have been.
NORA: 
LILY: I believe every word Valerie said. When she told me what happened to her, it was as if all the lights in the room went on... And I could finally see Julian for who he really is. That's why I'm leaving him.
VALERIE: She can't do it without your help. So the question is... Who do you believe?
NORA: Mare. You heard what she said. What are you waiting for?
LOUISE: Sorry. It's just this is a lot to take in.
NORA: That's why we stick together. We're family.
LILY: Beau, give me your hand.
LOUISE: What is she doing?
VALERIE: Bracing herself.
NORA: For what?
LOUISE: Lily, you're bleeding.
LILY: It's about to get a lot worse.
JULIAN: Ugh!
JULIAN: AGHH!
STEFAN: Let's tie him up.
STEFAN: Damon's tying up Julian right now.
STEFAN: I, uh, got his blood.
LILY: Good. They're waiting for it in the greenhouse.
STEFAN: Caroline's pregnant.
STEFAN: Yeah, I didn't really know what to say, either.
LILY: Do I even want to know how this happened?
STEFAN: Gemini spell. Twins. Not mine, obviously.
LILY: Wow. You must be overwhelmed.
STEFAN: Well, I didn't exactly, um, handle things the right way. Any advice?
LILY: Tell her you love her. Never forget what she must be going through. And then, one day... Be prepared for her to sacrifice everything for them. Not that I'm one to give advice. I chose Julian over everything.
STEFAN: Yeah, but now he's gonna die, and you can start over without him.
LILY: It's too late, and so much has already been lost.
STEFAN: You haven't lost me.
LILY: Really?
STEFAN: Uh... I guess, uh... Willingness to forgive the unforgivable is in my genetics.
LILY: Mmhmm. And unfortunately, Damon... Doesn't feel the same way about forgiveness.
STEFAN: 
LILY: No. He's gone. I saw it in his eyes. He... he wishes me dead.
STEFAN: Do you think that I haven't seen that look before? Damon has been practicing that look on me for the last 150 years.
LILY: Well, then maybe you could offer your mother a little advice in return. How do I get him back?
STEFAN: Time.
JULIAN: And my mind is boggled by this blind devotion you have for Lily, when the woman mused up an idea to keep you away from your soulmate for what, sixty years? Seventy years?
DAMON: 
JULIAN: And yet here you are, essentially risking your life to be here with me in order to keep her alive.
VALERIE: Don't listen to him. He knows he's dead either way. But if he can provoke you to kill him now, then you spend eternity as the boy who killed his own mother.
JULIAN: Mmm, aren't you a clever girl? It's a shame. I suppose your little one would have had the same smarts...
VALERIE: Rot in hell, Julian.
LOUISE: What is this?
JULIAN: Apparently whoever wins at foosball gets to kill me.
DAMON: It's pinball, and I have the high score. Did you break that link yet?
LOUISE: How do I know that you were pregnant with Stefan's child?
VALERIE: Are you testing me? Do you really believe that I would make that up?
LOUISE: You lied to Lily about your affair with Stefan, just like you lied to us about killing Oscar, so why should I believe that you're telling the truth now?
DAMON: All right, Nancy Grace, enough. Let the adults handle this.
DAMON: Ow!
VALERIE: What are you doing?
JULIAN: And that, Mary Louise, is why you've always been my favorite.
CAROLINE: Well, you're either really drunk, or calling to tell me that you found a new girlfriend.
STEFAN: None of the above, although a drink does sound really good right about now.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Listen, I'm really sorry about earlier. I didn't know what to say, and I didn't want to say the wrong thing, so I just... bailed.
CAROLINE: Well, I guess there's no right thing to say when you find out your girlfriend is magically pregnant with another man's babies. Look, I know that this is happening to both of us. And you stood by me through... everything I went through with my mom, so I totally get it if you want to run for the hills.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: I guess there is a right thing to say after all...
STEFAN: Listen... No matter how... weird this all gets, I'm here for you. We're gonna get through this together.
CAROLINE: Are you sure? 'Cause it could get really weird.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
NORA: Mare, hey. Where are you going? We still need to unlink Lily.
LOUISE: I have to get out of here.
NORA: Mare, stop. You've been crying. What happened?
LILY: Oh, my God...
JULIAN: Things have grown out of hand, Lily. Enough is enough.
LILY: 
JULIAN: I can't. 'Cause if I do, this bloody cycle will continue. And I love you-- and the family that we have built together-- far too much for that to happen. So... one lives, one dies. You have to choose which.
LILY: 
JULIAN: Oh, but you will. You have spent far too long trying to have it all. The lies, the... the violence, all because you wanted the impossible. Well, the truth is, you're either a Salvatore, or you're one of us, but you cannot be both.
JULIAN: Now choose.
JULIAN: Choose!
NORA: How could you do that to Lily?
LOUISE: 
NORA: This is different.
LOUISE: 
NORA: He took her child from her! And you would side with him?
LOUISE: And you would side with a girl who murdered her own brother?
LOUISE: No! What are you doing?
NORA: This doesn't represent our love-- it represents Julian's ability to manipulate us. I don't want it.
LOUISE: Nora, please!
NORA: I don't want any of it.
LOUISE: Nora. Nora!
LILY: This isn't you. This is not the man that I fell in love with. You used to be kind, gentle, funny.
LILY: No, no-- you... you're still in shock from the hell that you've been trapped in for so long.
VALERIE: Hell didn't turn him evil, Lily. He was born this way.
DAMON: Okay, this vervain stings like a bitch, and your family drama makes the prospect of hell look like Disneyland. So please, one swift stab straight through the heart. Let's get this over with.
DAMON: You chose your Heretics over Stefan and me every chance you had. Why stop now?
VALERIE: Lily, please...
LILY: You are such a strong girl. I am so sorry I didn't see it sooner.
LILY: My son... Please forgive me.
DAMON: Kill me! Come on! Do it, Lily!
LILY: You're wrong about so many things. I never had the courage to tell you before... But I do now. You are wrong, Julian. I can choose them both.
JULIAN: No! Lily! Lily, Lily. My sweet, foolish girl! I've already unlinked us!
STEFAN: No!
NORA: LILY!
MATT: Save your strength. You're full of vervain. You couldn't break out of here on your best day.
ENZO: What the hell did you do?
MATT: I took your advice. You see, you're right. I can't protect Mystic Falls on my own, so I made some friends who could help.
ENZO: Who are these friends?
MATT: Sorry, I can't tell you. See, they'd like to introduce themselves. I guess I was wrong. Someone wanted you after all.
ENZO: AAH!
NORA: The splinters must be inside your heart. I can't... I can't get them out.
LILY: Nora... It's all right.
NORA: What do I do? Tell me what to do!
STEFAN: You say goodbye.
NORA: We wouldn't be a family without you, Lily. I love you. I am so sorry this happened...
NORA: Goodbye.
LILY: I guess... Only one of us gets the luxury of time. Promise me you'll use yours to the fullest.
LOUISE: Nora gave me back the ring...
LOUISE: What is all this?
JULIAN: Lily, uh... She staked herself in her heart.
LOUISE: What?
JULIAN: She thought that killing herself would kill me. She didn't realize that you had already unlinked us. I thought breaking the spell would protect her. If her sons succeeded in killing me... She would be spared. But it's...
LOUISE: No. No. Tell me this isn't real. Tell me this isn't happening!
JULIAN: She's gone, Mary Louise. She's gone.
VALERIE: I forgive you for loving him, Lily. You just wanted to love us all. There's no sin in that.
VALERIE: She only has moments left. Make the most of them.
LILY: Damon. I'm truly sorry...
STEFAN: Say something.
DAMON: You made your bed.
DAMON: 
DAMON: Mom? Are you still here?
LILY: I'm so sorry. I don't think I can save you. You've been poisoned with werewolf toxin. Without proper treatment, you'll die soon.
DAMON: Okay, Mom, listen... While you're still here, there's something that's been nagging at me for... a long time.
DAMON: I'm so sorry.
LILY: "Mom?" Wow. You must really be having a bad trip. Your mother's been dead for years.
