Tyler: Mason, it's Tyler again. Look, your cell's voice mail is full. I need to talk to you. It's a full moon tomorrow and...I found your recording and I'm freaking out over here. So, just call me back, please.
Elena: Now that you've got this back, what are you gonna do with it?
Bonnie: Right now, it's what is binding the Sun and the Moon Curse. If I can figure out a way to remove the spell from the stone, the stone becomes useless.
Elena: And according to Katherine, Klaus becomes vengeful.
Bonnie: Maybe. If he finds out.
Elena: Bonnie, can't this wait? Stefan is stuck in the tomb with Katherine. We've got to get him out.
Bonnie: Stefan wants me to focus on this.
Elena: Don't listen to him. He thinks that he's protecting me, but he's wrong.
Bonnie: I'm taking Stefan's side with this one. We're not gonna let you get used in some creepy sacrifice ritual.
Jeremy: What are you guys arguing about?
Bonnie: We're not arguing about anything.
Bonnie: I need a coffee.
Elena: What?
Jeremy: Why are you on some suicide mission?
Elena: I'm trying to prevent everyone else from getting hurt.
Jeremy: Oh so, bringing Klaus the moonstone so you can get yourself killed is okay?
Bonnie: Where are you going?
Elena: Um, to see Stefan.
Bonnie: You're lying.
Elena: No, I'm not.
Bonnie: Really? Tell your face.
Elena: Are you serious?
Jeremy: She took the moonstone.
Elena: How did you...?
Bonnie: We tested you, and you failed.
Elena: Klaus killed Katherine's entire family just because she crossed him. I can't let that happen.
Elena: What did you do?
Bonnie: It's for the best, Elena.
Stefan: You trapped her in the house?
Damon: It's for the best. Trust me. Elena is on a martyr tear that rivals your greatest hits. You should be glad the witch and I are even getting along. I brought you this.
Damon: Care package: candles, lanterns and...lunch.
Stefan: Give that to me and I'm just gonna have to share it with her.
Damon: Yeah...
Katherine: You two are surprisingly calm, considering Klaus will hunt you down and kill you if you mess with his little plan.
Damon: I've been dead before. I got over it.
Damon: Once we deal with this moonstone, we'll figure a way to get you out.
Stefan: Don't worry about me. Just make sure Elena's safe.
Carol: Heading out?
Tyler: Yeah...lunch at the Grill, I've got practice and I'll probably go out after. I'll be late.
Jules: Hi.
Tyler: Hi.
Jules: Sorry. Rude. You have no idea who I am. I'm Jules, a friend of Mason's from Florida. You must be Tyler.
Tyler: Yeah. Nice to meet you.
Jules: So, I know it's weird for me to just stop by but I'm trying to track down Mason.
Carol: Mason's back in Florida. He has been for a while now.
Jules: See...that's the thing...he's not.
Jenna: So now I'm playing historical society hostess to some writer who's doing his book on small town Virginia.
Alaric: Well that sounds...
Jenna: Lame, yeah, but Carol Lockwood played the "dead husband" card, said she was too busy to deal. Plus, my sister kept most of the archives, so there you have it.
Tyler: Hey.
Caroline: Hey. What's wrong?
Tyler: This girl Mason knows stopped by the house. She said he never made it back to Florida. My mom is freaking out and she was on the phone with your mom when I left.
Tyler: We should get going.
Caroline: Yeah.
Damon: You should really lock your door. 
Elena: Do you think this is funny?
Damon: Yes Elena. I find hilarity in the lengths that I have to go to repeatedly save your life.
Elena: What does Stefan say about this?
Damon: We had a good laugh.
Elena: And what did he say about Elijah still being alive?
Damon: Yeah, that...I didn't tell him.
Elena: Why not?
Damon: Well A: he can't do anything about it; and B:...what I just said.
Damon: Where is Bonnie?
Jeremy: I thought she was meeting you.
Damon: No, she's on moonstone duty and I'm on Elena patrol.
Jeremy: And who's on Tyler Lockwood and the full moon?
Damon: Vampire Barbie asked me if she could handle it, and I said, why not? Figured if she screwed up, he'll bite her and then I'll be rid of two of my problems.
Elena: Hold on a second. Tonight's the full moon?
Damon: Yep, but you were too absorbed with all your suicidal tendencies to notice.
Damon: What?
Alaric: Sheriff Forbes has officially declared Mason Lockwood a missing person.
Damon: What? Why?
Alaric: Some girl from Florida showed up on the Lockwood's door step looking for Mason.
Damon: What girl?
Alaric: I don't know but she sure got everyone in a tizzy.
Damon: That's not good. Where are you?
Alaric: I'm at the Grill.
Damon: I'm on my way.
Damon: Change of plans. You babysit.
Damon: Hey you know, you should get out, enjoy the sun. Oh wait, you can't.
Caroline: Maybe he just stopped to go surf somewhere. Isn't that Mason's whole thing?
Tyler: Maybe. This girl just seemed to think he would have called.
Caroline: I'm sure he's okay.
Tyler: Yeah, anyway...let's do this.
Jules: So you'll call me as soon as you hear anything?
Carol: Of course.
Jules: Oh, I didn't get to say goodbye to your son.
Carol: I'm afraid he's at the Grill with his friends. I'll let him know. 
Jules: Hey, I'm here. No one knows where Mason is. He's missing. You were right, Mason was lying, there's another werewolf...his nephew.
Jules: Hey, excuse me. Crazy question: do you know Tyler Lockwood?
Damon: Mmm, Mason's mystery woman.
Alaric: Where is Mason anyway?
Damon: Decomposing in his truck.
Alaric: So you think she is a werewolf?
Damon: Well I hope not, being that it's a full moon, Ric, but we should definitely find out.
Alaric: What is that?
Damon: Wolfsbane.
Caroline: Tell me you brought the instruction manual.
Tyler: Tell me you brought the wolfsbane.
Caroline: Yes. Not an easy herb to find. This is it.
Tyler: I have a water bottle in my bag, we can mix it in there.
Tyler: The guy at the hardware store said this set-up could hold up to 5,000 pounds.
Caroline: Is that more than a werewolf can pull?
Tyler: I have no idea.
Caroline: 
Tyler: Still human.
Caroline: Oh my god, you're not gonna get naked, are you?
Tyler: It's elastic. What should I wear? I don't think it's like The Hulk, where I get to keep my pants.
Bonnie: Hi.
Luka: I don't know what makes me more upset: that I showed you how to channel, or that you almost killed me.
Bonnie: Luka, I'm so sorry. I wouldn't have done what I did unless it was really important. It's just that there are things that I...
Luka: I forgive you.
Bonnie: Wow. So much stuff. What is that? Is this a grimoire?
Luka: They're all grimoires.
Bonnie: How did you get all these?
Luka: Witches from all over the world have collected their spells in grimoires, but over the centuries, most of them have gotten lost and my dad is obsessed with finding them, and making sure that our family's heritage stays intact.
Bonnie: This can't all be your family's.
Luka: Well the way he sees it, all witches are family. We're all bound together by a code of loyalty to help each other.
Bonnie: So that's why you've been so nice to me.
Luka: That's one reason. (smiles.)
Bonnie: Listen...do you know how to break the bind between a talisman and a spell?
Luka: That depends, because spells are unique and very specific; but I'm sure that we can figure it out.
Alaric: Well hello. Can I have a scotch and whatever this beautiful woman is drinking.
Jules: (laughs lightly) No, one is my limit.
Alaric: Oh come on, it's not like I'm a freak. I'm just being friendly to somebody who's new to town.
Jules: Okay, if you insist. How do you know I'm new?
Alaric: Because I've never seen you here before and I am here every night.
Damon: Excuse me, is this guy bothering you?
Alaric: I'm not bothering anybody.
Damon: Perfect. Well...Do it elsewhere.
Damon: Don't worry, he's harmless. He's sort of the town drunk. And you know, when we get tired of him we just put him in a cab and send him back to wherever he came from.
Alaric: Please don't talk about me like I'm not here.
Damon: Why are you here?
Jules: Thank you for the drink.
Katherine: So we're fasting now? We're so pious. How long have you actually gone without blood? I know you get desiccation in theory, Stefan, but in reality, it's much worse. Your heart still beats, struggling to pump whatever blood remains. When it's gone, your veins rub together like sand paper. It's excruciating.
Stefan: The pleasure I'll get from watching you suffer is greater than any pain I'll ever feel.
Katherine: It's stuffy, and I've been in this dress for days. You want to help me get out of it? Come on, Stefan. Don't be such a grump.
Katherine: We're here together. May as well make the best out of it.
Katherine: You really think Damon is gonna rush to get you out? He's got what he wants: Elena.
Stefan: Stop.
Katherine: Given what's most certainly going out there, I'd say you're free to do whatever you want in here. Nobody will ever know.
Stefan: Stay out of my head.
Katherine: (smirk) Maybe I can do eternity in here after all.
Elena: Hey, what are you doing?
Jenna: Perfect timing.
Elena: What is this stuff?
Jenna: Your mom's files from the Historical Society. I got roped into helping Mrs. Lockwood and by roped, I mean very excited to participate.
Elijah: Hey, I'm Elijah.
Jenna: Elijah's in town doing research on Mystic Falls.
Elijah: It's a pleasure.
Jenna: So you're welcome to stay here and rummage through this stuff or Elena and I could help you load it into your car.
Elijah: Or I can get someone to pick it up tomorrow.
Jenna: Also a good plan.
Elijah: Thank you so much for inviting me into your home, Jenna; and Elena...
Elijah: I hope to see you again sometime soon.
Jeremy: What is it?
Elena: Jenna was just asking me to get you to help her with the boxes.
Jeremy: Okay.
Elijah: A wise choice.
Elena: What do you want?
Elijah: I think it's time you and I had a little chat.
Damon: There's a B&B down the road and there's a motel on I-90 but you know, if you ask me, it's kind of a mistake.
Jules: No, it's fine. I'm just here for the night. It's a long story, I'm looking for my friend.
Damon: Who?
Jules: Mason Lockwood.
Damon: I know Mason!
Jules: You do?
Damon: Yeah. He's a great guy.
Jules: He's missing.
Damon: What do you mean? Like...I mean, missing missing?
Jules: How do you know Mason?
Damon: Friends of friends.
Tyler: What time is it?
Caroline: Almost eight. What time does the moon crest or whatever?
Tyler: Not for a while. Mason's journal said the first transformation can happen before the moon hits its apex.
Caroline: Does it say how long you'll actually be a wolf?
Tyler: A few hours. Maybe more, maybe less.
Caroline: Are you sure you want to do that?
Tyler: Yeah. Mason said it'll diminish my strength so I can't break free.
Caroline: Tyler...
Tyler: No.
Caroline: Shhh...
Tyler: Don't! Don't!
Tyler: I'm sorry.
Elijah: Forgive the intrusion. I mean your family no harm.
Elena: Why did you kill those vampires when they tried to take me?
Elijah: Because I didn't want you to be taken. Klaus is the most feared and hated of the Originals, but those that fear him are desperate for his approval. If word gets out that the doppelgänger exists, there'll be a line of vampires eager to take you to him and I can't have that.
Elena: Isn't that exactly what you're trying to do?
Elijah: Let's just say that my goal is not to break the curse.
Elena: So, what is your goal?
Elijah: Klaus's obsession has made him paranoid. He's a recluse. He trusts only those in his immediate circle.
Elena: Like you?
Elijah: Not anymore.
Elena: You don't know where he is, do you? So you're trying to use me to draw him out.
Elijah: Well, to do that I need you to stay put and stop trying to get yourself killed.
Elena: How do I know you're telling the truth?
Elijah: If I wasn't being truthful, all your family would be dead and I'd be taking you to Klaus right now. Instead, I'm here and I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
Elena: What kind of a deal?
Elijah: Do nothing. Do nothing, live your life, stop fighting and then, when the time is right, you and I shall draw out Klaus together and I shall make sure your friends remain unharmed.
Elena: And then what?
Elijah: Then I kill him.
Elena: Just like that?
Elijah: Just like that. I'm a man of my word, Elena. I make a deal, I keep a deal.
Elena: How are you gonna be able to keep everybody safe?
Elijah: I notice you have a friend; Bonnie, is it? She seems to possess the gift of magic. I have friends with similar gifts.
Elena: You know witches.
Elijah: Together, we can protect everybody that matters to you. So, do we have a deal?
Elena: I need you to do one more thing for me.
Elijah: We're negotiating now?
Luka: You know, this is good. This is really good. There's a clear view of the moon and it's private.
Bonnie: If anyone looks out, they're gonna think we're insane.
Luka: Are we? So what is this mysterious talisman we're unbinding?
Luka: Oh, wow, a white rock. This is fascinating.
Bonnie: Hey! I know it doesn't look like much...
Luka: What's it spelled with?
Luka: Really? Help a girl out, she still keeps secrets.
Bonnie: Sorry...
Luka: I'm just teasing you.
Caroline: Hey. Tyler. Tyler.
Tyler: I'm burning up. It burns!
Caroline: I know. Just breathe through this, okay?
Tyler: I'm trying. You should go. You should leave.
Caroline: Not yet.
Tyler: It hurts. It hurts.
Damon: You know, listen, I'm really tight with the sheriff. If there's anything I can do to help locate Mason, I will. He's a great guy, and after his brother's funeral, he stuck around and helped his nephew and...
Jules: Tyler?
Damon: Yep. Mason was with him the whole time. Helped him through all that grief. 
Jules: You know, I'm not much of a drinker. I should get going.
Damon: Oh, come on. Look, one drink.
Jules: It'll help me sleep.
Damon: To sleep.
Jules: You fool. You think you're clever, don't you?
Damon: What do you want with Mason Lockwood?
Jules: He's my friend.
Damon: Well, I'm sorry to inform you that you probably won't find him.
Jules: And why not?
Damon: You should leave town.
Jules: You're threatening me? On a full moon? How stupid are you?
Alaric: Damon, how about that second round?
Damon: I think we're done, Rick.
Damon: You think I'm afraid of you?
Jules: No, I don't. That's your vampire arrogance. You should be. I sniffed you out the moment you entered this bar, along with your pathetic wolfsbane. I've been at this a long time, and any other night of the month, the situation would be reversed, but tonight is not the night to pick a fight with me. You've been marked.
Caroline: I want to help but I don't know what to do.
Tyler: There's nothing you can do.
Tyler: Get out!
Caroline: No!
Tyler: Get out! I don't want to hurt you.
Caroline: No! No.
Damon: Where is she?
Alaric: Just let it go, Damon. Don't be stupid.
Damon: So what? Just let her get away? "You've been marked". What the hell kind of wolf throw-down crap is that anyway?
Alaric: Damon, look up! Just look up.
Alaric: If this werewolf stuff is true, one bite and you're dead. One bite! Alright? Don't risk it. Just go home, lock your doors and we'll deal with it in the morning.
Damon: 
Caroline: It's okay. You'll fight through it, okay?
Tyler: Leave!
Caroline: No.
Tyler: Just go, please!
Caroline: No, not yet.
Tyler: Just go!
Caroline: I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere.
Damon: You just can't stay away, can you?
Rose: You don't answer your phone.
Damon: What do you want?
Rose: I wanted to apologize.
Damon: Just admit it, you don't have anywhere else to go.
Rose: I'm sorry about Elena. I wasn't thinking straight. I didn't know that she had a death wish but I called you, I tried to make it right, okay? I'm sorry, Damon. And I have nowhere else to go.
Damon: There's nothing here for you, Rose.
Rose: Well, then...
Damon: How bad is it?
Rose: It hurts.
Damon: 
Rose: Oh my God, I thought a werewolf bite was fatal! I thought...
Damon: You're gonna be okay.
Jonas: You were successful?
Luka: Of course I was. She fell for the whole...show and didn't suspect a thing.
Jonas: Thank you, Luka.
Luka: Yeah, whatever. I'm going to sleep.
Jonas: Wait. There's one more thing Elijah needs us to do before we lose the full moon.
Katherine: Are we seriously not going to talk at all?
Stefan: We could talk about how you regret all you've done to make my life miserable.
Katherine: What do you want me to say, Stefan? That I'm sorry for everything that I've done? Well I'm not, okay? It's called self-preservation. I've been looking out for myself for 500 years.
Stefan: Look where it has gotten you.
Katherine: Yes, I've done terrible things. I know that, but I do love you, Stefan. Even if you don't believe it.
Stefan: You want me to believe you? Show me. Do something. Prove to me that there's something inside of you that's actually worth trusting.
Katherine: And then what? You're still gonna hate me.
Stefan: Maybe and maybe I'll see that there's still hope for you after all.
Katherine: You're playing me.
Stefan: Am I?
Katherine: You want to find Klaus? Kill him so that you can protect your precious Elena?
Stefan: Let me guess: you know where he is.
Katherine: No, I don't, but I could help you find him.
Stefan: For a price I'm sure.
Katherine: Start with Isobel, Elena's mother. She was a research expert. She found me.
Katherine: You're welcome.
Katherine: Elijah.
Elijah: Good evening Katerina. Thank you for having the good sense to be frightened.
Elijah: Your release has been requested.
Stefan: What? By who?
Elijah: The lovely Elena drives a hard bargain. However, we reached a peaceful agreement, she and I. Please.
Elijah: Come.
Stefan: I can't.
Elijah: Yes, you can. I've had the spell lifted.
Elijah: As for you however, you should not exit until I say so. When Klaus comes, he'll want to know exactly where you are.
Elijah: You're free to go. Elena will explain the arrangement to you. If she keeps her word, I'll keep mine.
Katherine: Stefan, no. Please don't let him leave me in here.
Stefan: Goodbye Katherine.
Caroline: Tyler?
Tyler: Caroline.
Caroline: Tyler.
Caroline: You're okay. You made it. You didn't get out. You're okay.
Tyler: No, I'm not.
Stefan: Elena? Hey.
Elena: Hey!
Damon: I talked to Caroline. She said Tyler was all locked up.
Rose: So it was Jules. The other werewolf, the one who attacked you.
Damon: Yeah. I'm sorry. I picked a fight with her. She was coming after me.
Rose: All's well that ends well.
Damon: You're all healed?
Rose: Yeah. Seems that way.
Damon: Rose...uh...I'm happy that the legend was fake. Maybe the werewolves made it up to keep vampires away.
Rose: Lucky me.
Rose: I'm gonna stay and help you.
Damon: Help me do what?
Rose: Save Elena, protect Elena, all things Elena.
Damon: Really? Why?
Rose: Because I like you. I believe in friendship. I happen to have a vacancy in that department, and you can use all the friends you can get.
Damon: Just friends?
Rose: Just friends.
Damon: Are you sure you can do that?
Rose: I don't love men who love other women. I think more of myself than that, but that doesn't mean I can't be your special friend.
Damon: I think I like you.
Rose: Ow.
