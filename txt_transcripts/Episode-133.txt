ELENA: What are you doing?
DAMON: Waiting for you.
ELENA: (confused) On the ground where we first met?
DAMON: I'm feeling symbolic.
ELENA: It's bad, isn't it?
DAMON: (hesitates) I believe you owe me a dance, Miss Gilbert.
ELENA: (concerned) Damon, just tell me. How bad is it?
DAMON: Dance with me, please.
DAMON: Elena?
DAMON: (worriedly) Come on. Hey, wake up. Elena?
ALARIC: (distraught) Oh god. Someone, please help.
JOSHUA: (shouts) Kai!
DAMON: Come on, just drink it.
DAMON: Stefan? STEFAN?
DAMON: She won't wake up.
CAROLINE: Oh, my God.
DAMON: She won't wake up. I don't understand.
STEFAN: Get her to the hospital, now.
DAMON: Yeah.
CAROLINE: (worriedly) She's human, what if she doesn't -
KAI: Nothing personal, but this is a family matter now.
KAI: Tsk. Oh.
JOSHUA: (chants loudly) Sanguinem filio. Sanguinem effurgarex perpetuum.
KAI: (sighs) Let me guess, Prison World?
COVEN: (chants) Sanguinem filio. Sanguinem effurgarex perpetuum.
KAI: (unimpressed) I mean, you can't kill me. Or else you all die too, right.
ALARIC: (sobbing) Ohh, ohh.
KAI: (softly) Hey, I'm sorry about your twinsies. I just don't feel like competing for leadership with future Gemini twins. (He kneels down next to him) See... when your family decides that your nothing but an irredeemable piece of trash, well... I guess the best thing to do is prove them right, right?
KAI: This ought to do it.
JOSHUA: (horrified) No!
ELENA: You're going easy on me. Come on. This is supposed to be a special moment.
ALARIC: Yeah, no. I can't do this.
ELENA: Don't do that. Don't give up like that.
ALARIC: Why not? (He turns around so his back it to Elena) I have nothing left to fight for.
BONNIE: Damon!
DAMON: (sighs in relief) Ah. Bonnie Bennett. You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice right now.
BONNIE: (anxiously) Damon, Kai's out.
DAMON: (sighs) I know. I'm glad you're safe. I was worried Kai already got to you.
BONNIE: He did. And I don't know how, but I'm still alive. He drained my blood and that's all.
DAMON: (unhappily) That's not all. He was at the wedding. Jo's dead, he killed her.
BONNIE: (stunned and horrified) Oh my god.
DAMON: (frustratedly) And Elena got knocked out, and she's not waking up. The doctors keep telling me that there's nothing physically wrong with her. I don't know what to do, Bon.
BONNIE: Stay there. Okay? I'm coming.
ENZO: Good, you're up. Sorry to be indecorous, but you were both solidly unconscious when I pulled you from the wedding mayhem.
CAROLINE: Where are we going? (She suddenly remembers the chaos at the wedding) Elena!
ENZO: Elena is in the hospital with Damon. Kai is dead, and all the Gemini's are going down with him. And. I grabbed the two of you to help me deal with a bigger problem.
CAROLINE: (exasperatedly) There's a bigger problem?!
LILY: (calls out) Valerie? Malcolm?
STEFAN: Get in the car, please.
LILY: (rambling anxiously) 1702 Route 12. That's... That's where we are, right? I mean I read the map very carefully. He... He said they would be here. They're probably scared out of their minds.
STEFAN: (frustrated) Who are you talking about?
LILY: My friends. Kai brought them back when he escaped that prison. (She looks around the room but there's nothing in there. She turns around again.) They're here, somewhere.
STEFAN: (sighs) He lied to you. There's nobody out here. You made a deal with a sociopath, and now a lot of people are dead. You're wasting your time!
JOSHUA: Where's my daughter. Liv! Liv!
LIV: Oh, Tyler. Oh God, no. This can't be happening (She coughs up some blood) Oh, God. What's happening to me?
TYLER: Kai's dead, Liv. (Liv looks horrified and upset) I heard the screams. Your dad, your coven, they're all in there... dying. Which means--
LIV: (overwhelmed) No, no, no.
TYLER: I love you, Liv. You need to know that, if this has to be it for us.
LIV: (determined) No. You're not dying, not after everything. You're not dying, Tyler.
LIV: It's a full moon. If you turn, it will heal you. You have to.
TYLER: No. I'm not triggering it.
LIV: (crying) You once told me that I gave you a second chance, and you promised me that you wouldn't waste it. I love you. Let me do this for you.
TYLER: (groans in pain) Agh.
LIV: (whispers) Don't waste it.
TYLER: (crying) I love you.
TYLER: Nooo!
TYLER: Come on, answer! (More of his bones start to break as he shifts) Uhn, argh, ahhh! Answer, damn it!
MATT: (worriedly) Ty?
TYLER: (anxiously) Matt! Listen to me. You have to tell every-- ohh!
MATT: Ty, what's wrong?
TYLER: (sighs in shame) I triggered my curse.
MATT: (horrified) No.
TYLER: (panting for breath) Tell every vampire to steer clear of me. I don't know if I'll be able to control who I go after, and my bite will kill them!
TYLER: Ugh! Ahh! ahh!
STEFAN: Let me guess, not there either.
LILY: Did you come all this way to mock me?
STEFAN: No, I came here to put you back in your cell where you belong.
LILY: Do I look like a Ripper, Stefan? I've said repeatedly that the hope of being reunited with my family is enough to overcome the urges.
STEFAN: (loses his temper) Would you please just stop it with the word "family?" They're just a bunch of random people that you happened to sire!
LILY: (offended) We spent a century and a half together. We're loyal to each other. Our relationship is a deeper bond than I have ever known. What other word would I use?
STEFAN: (angrily) Lily, you either come with me right now, or you're out of my life. Do you understand me? Your son.
LILY: I'm sorry. (She returns to searching another warehouse) Malcolm, are you here sweetheart?
STEFAN: (furiously) What did you give Kai?
LILY: (confused) I thought you were leaving.
STEFAN: Tell me what you gave Kai in return for your family!
LILY: (hesitates) ...I gave him my blood.
KAI: (chants) Vodux.
KAI: (smirks) Here's to being different, Dad.
KAI: (sarcastically) Bad time?
KAI: Freaky, right? I turned myself into one of Lily's Heretics. It's really incredible, actually. I can literally siphon the magic of my vampirism and convert it into more magic.
KAI: (mockingly) Ooh. Looks like somebody's having a very bad day.
KAI: (chants) Motus!
KAI: Ha. Bad doggie.
ELENA: Here. Say it.
MATT: (clearly upset) No. I'm not doing this.
ELENA: (shrugs) Fine.
ELENA: I'll say it. Here lies Elena Gilbert, a fun girlfriend and an amazing friend.
MATT: I'm glad one of us can find humor in this.
ELENA: I have to find humor in this, Matt. Because the alternative... (She stops for a second.) The alternative would be to say good-bye, and I'm just... I'm not ready for that yet.
MATT: Bonnie, let's go. We got to get to the hospital.
MATT: What's wrong?
MATT: What is that?
says: "Watch me!Â :)")
BONNIE: I found it in the kitchen.
KAI: All this time travel's has been hard on the camera, Bon.
KAI: Yay! You saw the post-it. (He mimics a robot's voice) This message will self-destruct in ten seconds. (He laughs heartily) Kidding. Anyhow, you're probably wondering why you're still alive, since I should have bled you out, one painful ounce at a time. I mean, that's what you deserved. You left me behind in 1903, which I did not appreciate, but I guess you forgot about that old Canadian rock filled with Bennett blood. Anyway, even though I got out, I kind of just want to make you suffer, in new and-- if I may say so myself-- totally inspired ways.
MATT: (horrified) What is this?
BONNIE: (sadly) Keep watching.
KAI: (panting) What's happening to me?
DAMON: (sarcastically) Oh, you didn't happen to pet a fuzzy, four-legged vampire-killing machine, did you?
KAI: (seriously) How do I fix it?
DAMON: Easy, there's a cure in New Orleans. I'll get it for you. Just tell me what you did to Elena.
KAI: Oh, I can't do that.
KAI: Huh.
DAMON: (furiously) One thing you're not gonna do? You're not gonna mess with me. I am in a very volatile place right now, and I will start beheading people that I don't like, starting with you, if she doesn't wake up
DAMON: So, what did you do to my damn girlfriend?
KAI: (giggles) It's just not as threatening when I'm seeing like, four super-blurry versions of you. Heh heh.
DAMON: Fix her! I know it's a spell. She's in perfect health.
KAI: And she'll stay that way until she wakes.
KAI: Young, beautiful, human Elena Gilbert, preserved in this moment indefinitely.
KAI: (on camera) So, Bonster, I linked Elena's life to yours. The rule is-- as long as you're alive, Elena will remain asleep.
MATT: (in disbelief) Oh, my god.
DAMON: (enraged) Please tell me you didn't.
KAI: (gleefully) Oh, I totally did.
KAI: (on camera) And oh, please don't go looking for some weird witchy work-around, because as the incredibly-powerful leader of the Gemini's, I rigged this so that if you do try to outsmart it, both you and Elena will die-- instantly. I guess what I'm trying to say is your betrayal really hurt me, Bon. So, this is kind of all your fault.
MATT: You have to get out of town now, Bon.
BONNIE: I'm not letting Kai win!
MATT: Bon, Elena's the only thing that Damon Salvatore cares about. He'll kill you. You have to get out of here now.
KAI: Damon, think about it-- everyday that you wake up without Elena in your arms, you'll have the burning desire to kill Bonnie. Of course, you could just get it over with and kill her now, but Elena will probably never speak to you again.
ELENA: Hang on, hang on. I just... (She sits down on a rock) I just need two seconds. Heh.
STEFAN: Well, you're the one who chose a five mile hike to say goodbye to me.
ELENA: This isn't goodbye Stefan. Besides, this hike is where I told you I didn't want to be a vampire. I thought it would be fitting considering--
STEFAN: (amused) Because you're a weak human again?
ELENA: You knew that I never wanted to be a vampire, even before we took our first steps up that mountain. You just wanted to hear me say it out loud.
STEFAN: Well, a lot of good that did.
ELENA: I guess what I'm trying to say is that you knew me better than anyone. You always have, which is why you already know how impossible it is for me to-- to find the words to say goodbye.
STEFAN: (overwhelmed) Don't. I can't do this, not-- not now, not never
CAROLINE: Where's Damon?
STEFAN: Bonnie tracked Kai. He want to go beat the sleeping spell out of him.
CAROLINE: (hesitates) This whole thing with Elena... If they can't break the spell, are you gonna be okay?
STEFAN: Are you?
CAROLINE: Of course not. But when she wakes up, she'll still be my best friend-- after Bonnie's lived a long and happy life. Heh. But you? You were soulmates, and I want to make sure that you're okay.
STEFAN: I don't think Elena necessarily came into my life to be my soulmate. I mean, she was. We loved each other, but she was also the only person I've ever met who actually believed that my brother was worth loving, and she reminded me that I used to believe that about him, too. And her faith in him, it brought Damon and me back together. And yeah I--I loved her more than I could ever thought I could love somebody else. But I think, in the end, I needed him more then I needed her. Is that why... you feel you need to stay away from me, is it because you think that I haven't moved on?
CAROLINE: No, Stefan, I-- (She sighs) I'm sure it sounds like I'm making a million excuses but you and I-- (She sighs again) I can't do this right now. I'm sorry
KAI: Hello? Anyone still alive, hmm? Anyone alive just raise your hand. I need blood.
BONNIE: You need more than blood. Maybe some ointment? 'Cause gross.
KAI: Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Do your friends think you're funny? (He walks toward her) Because maybe if you were funny-- if you were the one with the good jokes, who they can always count on to make them laugh-- maybe they'd be cool with letting you live instead of Elena.
BONNIE: (shrugs) So, the sick humor's your thing, I'm just the one that does magic.
BONNIE: (unamused) Undo the spell, Kai.
KAI: (laughs through the pain) I can't. What's done is done.
BONNIE: (thrusts out her hand) Ossox!
BONNIE: Again!
KAI: I can't undo the spell, Bonnie. My death made it permanent.
BONNIE: Fine. I'll just wait for the werewolf bite to kill you.
KAI: You know what's funny? I didn't even know werewolves were real until I got bit by one.
KAI: The thing is, Bon-- the only way a guy turns into a wolf is if it's magic, right? So technically, their venom's magic, too. So I just went ahead and siphoned it up.
BONNIE: (terrified) No, no!
KAI: Motus!
DAMON: Just dance with me. This was supposed to be our big night.
ELENA: (concerned) Tell me, Damon. I can see it all over your face. How bad is it?
DAMON: (sighs) Kai linked you to Bonnie. (Elena, horrified, lets go of his hands and takes a step back) You won't wake up until she dies.
ELENA: What?!
DAMON: He won, Elena.
ELENA: (freaking out) What are you gonna do? Damon? Damon?
DAMON: Bonnie.
BONNIE: (relieved) Damon.
DAMON: Hey.
KAI: (incredulously) How dumb are you? I deliver you a dying Bonnie Bennett on a silver platter and *woosh*-- right over your head.
BONNIE: (gasping) Damon?
DAMON: (to Bonnie) You're okay.
BONNIE: Damon...
KAI: (snarkily) Uh, translation-- she's about to croak.
BONNIE: Damon.
KAI: (walks toward them) Of course, you don't have to help her. You could just walk away. She dies of collapsed lung, no blood on your hands, and you and Elena get to live the life you always dreamed of.
KAI: Either way, you better act quick.
DAMON: I'm so sorry, Bonnie.
KAI: (exasperatedly) That's it? He just left you? The whole point was that this would torture him for a while. I mean, you'd think he'd at least flip a coin-- heads he picks you, tails he picks--
DAMON: Heads it is!
DAMON: You think I was gonna leave you all alone, huh?
DAMON: No way. I'm not out of nicknames for you yet.
DAMON: Okay, let's do this. You two are up first.
CAROLINE: (softly) It's easy, Bon. We just take her hand... close your eyes... and let her into your thoughts.
BONNIE: (incredulously) Are we seriously having a sleepover?
CAROLINE: Come on! Hurry up and get in here. I'm the one who gets to see her again. I mean, you should get the better goodbye.
ELENA: (overwhelmed) Oh Care, come here (Elena hugs her) Take care of everyone while I'm gone, okay?
CAROLINE: (cries and nods) I will, I promise.
ELENA: Promise me something, both of you. (She grabs her journal and hands it to them.) Write it all down, everything that you accomplish in your life, every crush, when you fall in love, when you start a family, every time you fantasize about wanting to kill Damon..
ELENA: Write it down, so that one day when I wake up, I can read all about my best friends' lives and feel like I was there.
BONNIE: I'm so sorry, Elena. Really, I'm so sorry
ELENA: (smiles) This isn't your fault.
ELENA: (gently) Hey. We'll both get everything that we want. We just can't have it at the same time.
ELENA: Aw, hey. Bonnie Bennett. You have spent your entire life making sacrifices for me. Now it's my turn to do it for you. I just have one more favor to ask.
BONNIE: Okay.
ELENA: Okay.
ELENA: (sheepishly) Can you do it one last time?
MATT: (sighs) There, I did it. Are you happy?
ELENA: Very. Now it's your turn to be.
MATT: (looks down at his uniform) So, I'm a cop, huh?
ELENA: That's my hope for you, Matt. In our crazy lives together, you've always stayed the same-- human, loyal, and good. My hope is that you spend the rest of your life fighting for people like you.
MATT: You know, there's a good chance that I'll never see you again.
ELENA: Matt. (She smiles at him) Look at everything that the two of us have survived.
ELENA: (whispers) I like our odds.
ELENA: You're gonna think that the pain will never end, but it will. But first, you have to let it all in. You can't fight it. It's bigger than you. You have to let yourself drown in it. But then eventually you'll start to swim, and every single breath that you fight for will make you stronger
ELENA: And I promise that you will beat it.
JEREMY: Alaric?
ALARIC: Jeremy?
JEREMY: I--I tried to be here sooner. I wanted to be here for the wedding.
ALARIC: I'm glad you weren't
ELENA: You made it!
JEREMY: (laughs) Yeah. Three canceled flights. I could have walked here faster.
ELENA: Oh, and I was doing so well. Ha ha. (She sighs) I'm sorry, I wanted to at least pretend to be strong for you.
JEREMY: (gently) Hey-- when you do wake up, I want you to know that I spent my life doing exactly what I felt I was born to do. I was happy.
TYLER: So, where are we in this vision of yours?
ELENA: Not here, not in Mystic Falls.
ELENA: You need to get out of here, Tyler. You need to figure out what it is you want to do, who you want to be, and then just really fight for it. You're gonna be fine, Tyler. You're a wolf now, embrace it. Don't fight it. Let it be that thing that makes you extraordinary.
ELENA: Thank you for bumping into me that day in the hallway. I thought I would never be happy again, and then-- and then I met you. You changed everything for me. You-- you quite literally saved my life. I love you so much, which is why I can't wait to find out what new life you-- you've chosen for yourself in sixty or seventy years when I see you again.
STEFAN: (smiles sadly) I can guarantee it won't be high school
ELENA: Just be happy. I'll see you soon.
STEFAN: I'll see you, Elena.
LILY: Lorenzo. You came back. You must think me such a monster.
ENZO: We're all monsters in some way, I suppose.
LILY: My life before my friends was misery, even as a mother, a-a wife. I never felt whole. But then, I found these people, and, uh, I felt a part of something. Can you understand that just a little?
ENZO: I can because I've been searching for that my whole life.
LILY: (confused) What is it?
ENZO: That building, it wasn't there last night.
ENZO: Kai must have had this cloaked. When he died... Heh.
LILY: It can't be.
LILY: Lorenzo... It's our family!
DAMON: You think she'll be safe here?
STEFAN: If word gets out that her body has the cure inside, every vampire who wants to be a human will come busting through that door.
DAMON: Bonnie will spell it shut. We're under strict orders not to open it for anyone.
STEFAN: I guess that means that--
DAMON: ...That means it's time for me to say good-bye.
DAMON: You could have just told me what to do.
ELENA: I knew what you were going to do.
DAMON: You knew that the evil, selfish Damon Salvatore would give up the love of his life to save her best friend?
ELENA: I knew that the love of my life would stand by his best friend, even if it meant having to live without me for a little while
DAMON: Things are gonna be awfully dull around here without you.
ELENA: No they're not, Damon, because you're not gonna sit around waiting for me.
DAMON: (smiles weakly) I was thinking of doing the starvation diet, because desiccation makes the time go faster...
ELENA: (gives him a look) Damon, this isn't gonna work out if you just shut down. I need you to live your life, enjoy yourself. i want you to be happy. Now, how about that dance?
STEFAN: Yesterday, you told me you made a list of all the ways that loving me has ruined your life, and I get it. I haven't made it easy on you...
STEFAN: But I made a list, too, of all the ways that loving you has changed mine.
STEFAN: You were by my side when I needed a friend. You made me laugh. You made me dance. You told me that I would find love again... And, I understand if you need time to heal, and to live your life without me. And, I understand if I have to wait for you, and I will, I'll wait. And when you're ready for me, I will be ready for you
ELENA: Are you ready for this?
DAMON: Ready to spend the next sixty years of my life without you in it? Who's ever gonna be ready for that?
ELENA: I love you, Damon Salvatore.
DAMON: I love you, too.
