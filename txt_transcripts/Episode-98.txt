: And that's the state of the world from your hometown news station on June 11, 1953. Goodnight Mystic Falls.
Damon: Hey. I'm looking for Joseph Salvatore.
Joseph: 
Damon: Love what you've done with the place. If this whole boarding house thing doesn't pan out, you can always turn it into a high class brothel.
Joseph: Glad you got my telegram. I haven't heard from Stefan yet, but I'm hoping he'll be here soon. When's the last time you two spoke?
Damon: Well, he doesn't call, he doesn't write. Of course, neither do I. In all fairness, I am the one that abandoned him on a train platform in the middle of World War II.
Joseph: 
Damon: Eh, not sure I got one of those in me.
Joseph: Sorry about the vervain, Damon. The money was too good to pass up.
Whitmore: Well, now I won't have to pay him.
Damon: 
Whitmore: I'll be your doctor from now on.
Damon: 
Whitmore: Just a little vervain.
Damon: What the hell are you doing to me?
Maxfield: Vervain. To keep you calm.
Damon: Wes? Why am I here?
Maxfield: I lost a test subject last night, and you're gonna replace him.
Katherine: "Dear diary, so here I am alive. Stefan saved me from killing myself. Now he's got me on suicide watch. He says it would be therapeutic for me to write down my feelings about the fact that I'm dying and there's nothing I can do about it. Deep thoughts, mortal coil, blah blah blah. My hand's tired."
Katherine: What kind of sentimental idiot writes down everything they feel? Is this what the prophecy meant when it said that all the doppelg√§ngers were drawn together like magnets? Because if it is, I want my money back.
Stefan: I'm just trying to make sure you don't slit your wrists.
Katherine: Well, this whole neurotic granny vibe, doesn't exactly make me want to live. Do you really have nothing better to do than stand there all day and watch me write in cursive?
Stefan: I'm trying to make sure you don't kill yourself.
Katherine: And how are you going to do that? You know, since you're still having your little panic attacks?
Stefan: I'm fine.
Katherine: Yeah. Of course. You are the picture of mental health, Stefan, after being locked for three months in a safe, at the bottom of a quarry.
Stefan: I am dealing with it.
Katherine: I know. I mean, I heard you "dealing with it" earlier today in the library. It sounded like you freaked out and broke a chair, maybe even two. How are you supposed to help me stay alive if you can't even help yourself?
Stefan: So does this mean you want to live?
Katherine: No. It means I can't work with people who can't give me one hundred percent.
Katherine: And so, I may have called a backup.
Stefan: What are you doing here?
Caroline: I'm your sober sponsor, and I heard that you needed help.
Stefan: Really?
Caroline: And I got my Mom to drop off something for us to use.
Caroline: Don't worry. I sanitized it.
Elena: Aaron. Hey!
Jesse: Hey. So, you heard?
Elena: Heard what?
Aaron: That Jesse's dead. He killed himself last night. Campus security came by to tell me.
Elena: 
Aaron: What's up with this college? It's supposed to be different. I came here to start fresh, get away from all the crap in my past.
Elena: 
Aaron: How do you hit the reset button?
Elena: 
Aaron: So, if you're not here about Jesse, uh, why are you here?
Elena: I don't wanna bother you, especially not right now.
Aaron: My day's not gonna get any worse, so, uh, go ahead.
Elena: Okay. Well, um, last night, you told me that Wes was your legal guardian.
Aaron: Yeah. Since past summer after my aunt Sara died. You see what I'm talking about? Everyone around me ends up dead, and my sunny disposition makes me so many friends. It's-- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Elena: Um, the thing is my boyfriend Damon went to talk to Wes last night, and no one's really seen or heard from either of them since and that kind of worries me, you know? So I-- I know how bad the timing, is but I just-- I was hoping maybe you could help me find Wes.
Aaron: Yeah. Yeah. 
Damon: 
Maxfield: Is that what you told Dr. Whitmore?
Damon: 
Damon: As much as I would like a free checkup, 
Whitmore: (smiles and pats Damon on the shoulder) That's a good try. (shows Damon his watch) I'm wearing vervain.
Damon: 
Whitmore: This isn't a personal matter. It's for the advancement of science.
Damon: What the hell are you talking about?
Whitmore: You're a vampire. Your blood heals others, your body heals itself. You'll regenerate parts of internal organs, (he picks up scalpel) after I remove them.
Damon: Listen. How I got this amazing body has nothing to do with science, so running-- aah! 
Whitmore: You talk too much.
Damon: So you Augustine freaks are still at it, eye exams and that sort of thing?
Maxfield: Jesse was proof that my research goes far beyond that. 
Aaron: Just doesn't make sense why Jesse would kill himself.
Elena: So, you believe what campus security told you?
Aaron: Why, do you know something else?
Elena: Don't you think it's weird that both of your friends committed suicide before the first semester was even over?
Aaron: Yeah, of course I think it's weird. Jesse loved it here, he had a huge crush on your friend. Megan had all these plans for her life.
Elena: Which is why none of this makes sense. 
Aaron: You saw her death certificate?
Elena: I did some digging. Wes is part of something much bigger than anyone even realizes.
Aaron: 
Elena: Oh, um...
Aaron: Oh, yeah. This place is like a second home.
Elena: Mmmhmm.
Aaron: What are you waiting for? Come in.
Elena: So, who owns this place? 
Aaron: Not to sound like a douche, but technically, I do. 
Elena: Wait. Hold on. Your last name's Whitmore? So you, like, own this school?
Aaron: That's what they think.
Elena: That's my dad.
Maxfield: Grayson Gilbert was one of the best doctors the Augustines ever had.
Aaron: What the hell?
Maxfield: I'm glad he didn't live to see this.
Stefan: I spent three months drowning in this thing. What the hell were you thinking?
Caroline: I was thinking it's time for you to deal with the source of your PTSD.
Stefan: And you're sure you're not just sublimating your feelings about what happened to Jesse last night?
Caroline: 
Stefan: He was out of control, and Elena did what she had to do.
Caroline: No. Elena did what she thought she had to do, just like she also thought 
Stefan: Anyways, aren't you a drama major? What do you know about PTSD?
Caroline: 
Aaron: You know that this is kidnapping, right?
Maxfield: That was more like a tranquilizer.
Aaron: 
Maxfield: I had to make sure Megan's death didn't draw attention to my work.
Aaron: 
Maxfield: I study vampires.
Aaron: What?
Maxfield: They exist, Aaron, and Elena Gilbert is one of them. The syringe I used on her had vervain in it. Think of it as an anti-vampire drug. It's one of my safety measures.
Aaron: Where did all this stuff come from?
Maxfield: This work has been going on for generations in secret. Your family pioneered it. 
Aaron: Why didn't you ever tell me about this?
Maxfield: You never needed to know before now. 
Damon: 
Damon: Hey.
Elena: Damon? 
Damon: I'm fine. Wes injected you with vervain. Maybe when it wears off, we'll be able to-- 
Elena: 
Damon: Wes is carrying out the grand Augustine tradition. Getting his kicks off vampire torture.
Elena: Did he tell you that?
Damon: He didn't have to. I've been here before.
Damon: 
Damon: Kept me in this very cell, and don't think I haven't appreciated the irony.
Elena: How long were you here?
Damon: Five years, give or take.
Elena: Damon, how did you not go crazy?
Damon: Believe it or not, I made a friend.
Enzo: Welcome. Dr. Whitmore never gets tired of watching us vampire heal, but he gives us one glass of blood per day, just enough to keep us alive. Pick yourself up, soldier. 
Damon: 
Elena: How did he end up here?
Damon: Dr. Whitmore was working in a battlefield hospital when he discovered Enzo was a vampire, so he drugged him, locked him in a coffin to ship him overseas.
Damon: 
Enzo: You're doing it wrong. 
Damon: What future?
Enzo: The one where you get your revenge. For instance, in my future, my revenge will start with killing Whitmore's dog and mailing it to his house postage due. Go on. Picture your revenge. Use your imagination.
Damon: I can see it.
Elena: Damon, Wes knew my dad. They worked together. He said that my dad was an Augustine, too. I know that my dad was a vampire hunter, but he was also the town doctor. He was kind and gentle and loving. He wouldn't be part of a place that would cut your eyes out.
Damon: People are full of surprises. 
Stefan: Caroline! Do you even know what you're doing?
Caroline: 
Caroline: Let me find it.
Katherine: Did you ever, um...ahem...you know...? 
Caroline: 
Katherine: Oh, come on, you know. 
Caroline: Oh, my god! Katherine, seriously? 
Katherine: That wasn't exactly a yes...or a no.
Caroline: We are friends.
Katherine: 
Caroline: Oh, God. I am so not listening to this. 
Katherine: 
Katherine: 
Stefan: Caroline? Caroline!
Caroline: 
Katherine: Acting like a school teacher isn't going to make him feel any better.
Stefan: 
Katherine: You are right about one thing. He needs to get over the root of his problem. 'Cause right now the score if safe - one, Stefan - zero. So how do you help the guy that always comes to the rescue? Stefan's the hero. That's who he is at his core. He can't always come through for himself, but he can always come through for everyone else. 
Elena: Damon, how did you survive all those years?
Damon: 
Enzo: You much of a sports fan, Damon?
Damon: 
Enzo: No. Neither am I. Any other interests-- fine wines, travels, cars? 
Damon: 
Enzo: Oh, come now. Got to be more than that.
Damon: Well, the girl I was trying to impress was more of 
Enzo: What, just one girl?
Damon: Never met another one like her.
Enzo: Well, fair enough.
Damon: 
Enzo: Eh, too many to count. 
Damon: Where'd you meet her?
Enzo: Here of all places. She was working for Dr. Whitmore.
Damon: Charming?
Enzo: Oh, she was. Very. 
Damon: 
Enzo: Oh, she was also stunningly beautiful.
Damon: Ah.
Enzo: You have to understand she-- she wasn't part of the torture and the experiments. For the longest while, she didn't realize that Dr. Whitmore was doing more than just observing my behavior. I didn't have the heart to tell her. I was just so glad of her company, you know?
Damon: 
Enzo: When she finally realized what was going on here, she couldn't bear it. So she said she was sorry, and she left.
Damon: Well, you know, 
Enzo: You need a more positive outlook, mate.
Whitmore: Who's next?
Whitmore: (looks to Damon) 21051, you seem to have more energy. (Walks over in front of his cell, preparing to unlock it.)
Enzo: I take that as an insult! 
Enzo: I can't believe you didn't notice.
Whitmore: Your turn then.
Damon: Why are you doing this to us?!
Whitmore: (stops and looks at Damon)¬†Because, 21051,¬†I'm seeking out¬†the smallest indivisible unit of your biological makeup, and once¬†I can understand you from a cellular level, I can¬†put you to use.
Elena: 
Damon: Points for optimism. But unfortunately, Stefan doesn't even know this place exists.
Elena: But you were here for 5 years.
Damon: Yeah, and in the first year, I'd thought he'd rescue me. He didn't. Once I escaped, there was no point in giving him more to feel guilty about, so I never told him what happened here. I never told anyone.
Elena: Yeah, but you did escape. How did you do it?
Damon: They let us out of the basement once a year.
Damon: 
Damon: 
Whitmore: Mrs. Fell has generously offered her hand for the purpose of this demonstration. Please observe. (He cuts Mrs. Fell's hand with a knife across the palm, causing it to bleed.)
Damon: 
Whitmore: The dermal layer is completely healed, no nerve damage, no muscular damage.
Damon: But on the plus side, that's how Enzo came up with his plan.
Enzo: 
Damon: Are you sure that will work?
Enzo: I'm sure I can only try with your help. We've just got to choose between us.
Enzo: All right, Damon. We're gonna play scissor, paper, stone to decide.
Damon: Paper covers rock.
Enzo: 
Damon: 
Elena: So, did it work?
Damon: 
Elena: How did you get out?
Damon: It doesn't matter, Elena. I got strong, I got out. It wasn't pretty. All you need to know.
Maxfield: Here. Another birthday present. 
Aaron: Anna Ruby Campground. That's where my parents died.
Maxfield: 
Aaron: It wasn't an animal attack, was it?
Maxfield: I found them, Aaron. I found you next to their bodies. As soon as¬†saw them, I knew vampires had attacked them.
Maxfield: That's why I continued your father's work. 
Katherine: 
Katherine: I got in here when you were unconscious, and then Caroline locked us inside. It was the only way.
Stefan: Let me out of here! Caroline!
Caroline: I know it's a little extreme, but the baby steps approach wasn't working.
Katherine: See? That's why I need you not to get mad at me because when you get mad, you get anxious and violent and you rip people's heads off, but I'm gonna help you fix that.
Stefan: Caroline, get me out of here before I hurt her!
Katherine: That's the whole point, Stefan. You need to get over your PSTD triggers, okay? Or else you will kill me.
Stefan: 
Katherine: I'm already dying, you idiot. You're the one who wants to keep me alive. It's my turn to help you now.
Stefan: 
Katherine: 
Stefan: 
Elena: 
Damon: You don't want to know, Elena.
Elena: Why? You think I'm gonna judge you?
Elena: Damon, I love you. I love you, and these people tortured you for five years. Whatever you had to do, I don't care.
Damon: 
Damon: 
Whitmore: (walks between the crowd toward the cage) Ladies and gentlemen, as it is almost midnight, I think it fitting that we toast the New Year with a glass of vampire blood, wouldn't you agree? (He unlocks the cage, allowing Damon to step out. He then closes shut the cage and locks in Enzo.)
Damon: Now you see it.
Enzo: Damon! We got to get out of here! 
Damon: Vervain!
Damon: 
Damon: So I chose to save myself.
Enzo: Damon.
Damon: I'm sorry, Enzo.
Enzo: Damon, please.
Damon: And I knew if I was going to save myself, that I had to stop caring about Enzo. So I turned off my emotions.
Enzo: 
Enzo: Don't go! Please! 
Damon: 
Enzo: 
Damon: 
Damon: 
Caroline: 
Stefan: 
Katherine: 
Stefan: 
Katherine: 
Stefan: Any reason why you chose to have this conversation with me locked in a safe?
Katherine: Yes! So that I can show you that the safe isn't the problem.
Stefan: How could you say that to me?
Katherine: The problem is you're not facing you're real issues. The death you felt in the safe, the pain of dying over and over again? It's easier for you to focus on the physical pain than the emotional heartbreak of Elena leaving you. Your problem is you're not in touch with the reality of the moment, so let's bring you back to the present, shall we? 
Katherine: Fight it, Stefan, fight it! 
Caroline: It was so quiet, I got worried.
Caroline: 
Aaron: What the hell is this place?
Elena: 
Damon: Great. Mini-Wes.
Aaron: 
Elena: Aaron, you have to help us.
Aaron: I wanna know the truth. When you met at Megan's memorial, you asked me a bunch of questions.
Damon: Slick hands, cowboy.
Aaron: Yeah? Well, I've never used a gun before,...
Elena: What are you talking about?
Aaron: Wes said a vampire killed Megan. 
Damon: And you thought it was Elena?
Elena: No. Megan was inside this house. I hadn't even been invited yet. You just--
Aaron: Wes also said a vampire killed my parents. Maybe that was you, too.
Elena: No, Aaron. That's impossible--
Aaron: Why else would you be so interested in me?
Damon: Calm down.
Aaron: Why else would you pretend to be my friend? 
Damon: Not the one that killed your parents. That was all me.
Aaron: What did you just say? 
Elena: Damon, what are you doing?
Damon: 
Damon: Yes. I can see it. 
Enzo: Boo! I said use your imagination.
Damon: 
Damon: And that's exactly what I did.
Aaron: 
Damon: Since 1958? I lost count.
Elena: 
Elena: 
Damon: A few months ago. Her name was Sara. Had to go all the way to Charleston to find her. It was a weekend trip. You didn't know.
Elena: But we were together a few months ago.
Damon: Starting the summer of our lives.
Elena: 
Damon: 
Elena: No!
Caroline: A little help here! I mean, I know I'm a vampire, but this thing is really heavy! 
Stefan: You know, for the record, I, uh, I only broke one of these. 
Katherine: It was an ugly chair. 
Stefan: 
Katherine: 
Stefan: To be honest with you, I never know exactly what you're doing, Katherine.
Katherine: 
Katherine: Like right now...
Caroline: Hey, Elena. I'm probably going to stay at my Mom's tonight. I think I am officially homesick. So I'll let you know when I'm-- 
Katherine: 
Caroline: 
Maxfield: Look. I'm sorry¬†you had to find out about parents like this.
Aaron: What I found out was that I've been lied to my entire life. What the hell is going on, Wes? 
Maxfield: You'll be fine. Just go to school, live your life. 
Damon: Oh...
Elena: What's happening? 
Enzo: Ahh. Welcome. I'm 12144. My name's Enzo.
