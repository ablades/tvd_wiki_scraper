Damon: 
Damon: 
Katherine: Oh, my God!
Stefan: Hmm. Hey.
Katherine: Um, don't turn around.
Stefan: What are you doing?
Katherine: 
Stefan: Where are you going?
Katherine: 
Katherine: Uhn! Agh!
Katherine: What the hell happened to you?
Damon: Ditto. Elena's not here by any chance, is she?
Katherine: I haven't seen her, not that I've been looking.
Damon: 
Katherine: You know, he hasn't seen her either. I know because we were together all night.
Damon: 
Katherine: Why? What were you thinking? That our hot, naked bodies collided in one unforgettable night of passion?
Damon: I'm gonna barf.
Katherine: Great. Then my work here is done. Toodle. 
Damon: 
Maxfield: Subject 83182 appears conscious. 
Elena: 
Maxfield: Why? Look familiar?
Elena: 
Maxfield: 83182 resume prep for blood dialysis. 
Stefan: Where the hell you been?
Damon: Aw, you know, being held against my will, shot in the head, now I can't find Elena. 
Stefan: What a minute. What do you mean you can't find Elena?
Damon: I mean, she's not picking up her phone, she's not in her dorm, she's nowhere in this house, which leads me to believe that Dr. Creepy Ken-doll has her somewhere.
Stefan: Are you talking about the Whitmore bio teacher?
Damon: Yeah, the one that operated on vampires during business hours, yeah, that one. Put your hero hair on, Stefan. Let's go get Elena. 
Stefan: You just said you don't know where she is.
Damon: 
Damon: Pop quiz. 
you: A, get a new girlfriend; B, call the police; or C, kill someone close to the mad scientist?
Stefan: Sit.
Maxfield: 4.1 pints drained. 
Elena: 
Maxfield: 
Elena: My friends are gonna find me.
Maxfield: 
Elena: And this, holding people against their will, torturing them? How do you justify that?
Maxfield: Science. 
Elena: You're a monster.
Maxfield: This isn't my journal, Elena. 
Elena: What? 
Maxfield: Everything I'm doing to you I learned from him.
Aaron: I have no idea where Wes took her.
Stefan: Well, they're not at his lab, so where else could he hide a vampire?
Aaron: 
Damon: That's my brother Stefan, but I'd watch your tone with him because he's kind of in the midst of a psychotic break.
Stefan: I'm sorry. I'm what?
Damon: Oh, come on. You don't think I know about you and Katherine?
Stefan: Oh, I see. You're jealous.
Damon: More like disturbed. 
Aaron: How are you not dead? I shot you.
Damon: 
Aaron: I have no idea. All that Wes told me was to go about my life as usual.
Damon: We're gonna call Wes, and you're gonna tell him that if he doesn't give us Elena the next experiment that he conducts it's gonna be sewing your arms back on.
Elena: This is my dad's clinic. We're in the basement.
Maxfield: Was your dad's clinic. Then your town council burned a whole bunch of vampires down here. Now it's just a condemned building in Mystic Falls where no one will find us.
Maxfield: Aaron, hey.
Aaron: Do you have Elena?
Maxfield: Aaron, what's wrong?
Aaron: Uh, Stefan and Damon Salvatore are gonna kill me unless you give them Elena.
Maxfield: Damon Salvatore is locked in an impenetrable and inescapable fortified cell.
Aaron: Or he's in front of me imagining what my kidney would taste like.
Maxfield: 
Maxfield: Enzo...Enzo, wake up. 
Enzo: 
Maxfield: An insurance policy. Guarantees you'll come back to me. I'm giving you the day off. 
Katherine: I don't hear you counting.
Matt: 3, 4, 5, 6.
Matt: Good try.
Katherine: Good try? That was horrible, Matt. Come on. I'm paying you to make me hot again, whipe me into shape, and prolong this death thing as long as possible.
Matt: Yeah, that will happen.
Katherine: What did you say? 
Matt: Deep breaths. 
Katherine: Tried that. Every time I ingest vampire blood, my body rejects it. 
Katherine: Who is that? I can't see.
Matt: It's Nadia. I told her you where here.
Nadia: "Dear Nadia, sorry I had to kill your boyfriend, but it was the motherly thing to do. Suicide, however, not very motherly of me."
Katherine: Great. So, um, Stefan obviously gave you my suicide note. What's your point?
Matt: Damn!
Nadia: That's for trying to kill yourself without saying goodbye.
Stefan: You want to give me a little back story as to how you know one another?
Damon: Aaron is Aaron Whitmore, and he comes from a very long line of vampire-probing, blood-testing, organ-removing freaks called Augustine.
Stefan: Why do you know this?
Damon: Because I was their test subject in the '50s.
Stefan: What do you mean test subject?
Damon: Meaning I donated my body to science except I was alive and it was against my will.
Stefan: Wait. Hold on a minute. 
Damon: Don't get all guilt-ridden, Stefan, on me. We were on the outs back then, and by the time it was over, you know, it was over.
Aaron: Why don't you finish the rest of the story, Damon?
Stefan: 
Damon: I don't remember anything.
Stefan: I didn't think so.
Nadia: I get it now. If I was living here, I'd want to kill myself, too.
Katherine: 
Nadia: In a moment of weakness, you eat chocolate or kiss the wrong boy. You don't jump off a clock tower.
Katherine: 
Nadia: Okay. Then, what changed your mind?
Katherine: It's not so much a matter of what as it is who. Can I ask you something, absentee mother to mildly abusive daughter? 
Nadia: I'm listening.
Katherine: Do you think after all the horrible things that I've done it would be possible to be forgiven?
Nadia: Of course I do. 
Katherine: I'm listening.
Elena: 
Maxfield: 
Elena: Do you know if he ever brought a vampire down here?
Elena: I remember coming down here as a kid. 
Elena: Wes, I saw Enzo when I woke up. I know he's alive. Where is he?
Maxfield: 
Elena: 
Damon: Which one is it?
Aaron: It's right here.
Enzo: 21051.
Damon: 
Damon: It's been a while, mate.
Stefan: Who the hell are you?
Enzo: Lorenzo, but my friends call me Enzo. Ah. Kidding. I don't have any friends.
Damon: 
Enzo: That's your first question for me? Not "How are you? How'd you survive in that fire I left you to die in?"
Aaron: Uh, does somebody want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Enzo: I'd love to. Have a seat. Been waiting seventy years to tell my story. 
Elena: Enzo is the Augustine vampire. He killed my roommate Megan, didn't he?
Maxfield: Conserve your energy. I've drained enough blood to start phase two.
Elena: Let me guess. You're not gonna tell me what phase two is, are you?
Maxfield: If it works, you'll be the first one to know. 
Elena: Why did Megan have a picture of my dad on her cell phone?
Maxfield: Maybe because her parents helped fund your father's projects.
Elena: They knew about Augustine, too?
Maxfield: 
Elena: Vampire blood.
Maxfield: 
Elena: She found Enzo in his cell.
Maxfield: And being clueless to what a starving vampire will do around fresh human blood, I'm guessing she got too close. 
Stefan: Where's Elena?
Maxfield: Who's this?
Stefan: We have Aaron, and we're trying to decide how to kill him.
Maxfield: Funny. I have Elena, and I'm wondering how she'll function without her cerebral cortex. Touch him, and you'll never see her again.
Stefan: That threat works both ways.
Enzo: Damon and I had been locked in those cells for years, tortured, beaten, humiliated, but we weren't gonna let them break us, no. We decided if were going to escape, we needed to work together.Â 
Stefan: 
Enzo: Tragic. Can I continue my story now, please?
Damon: 
Stefan: He doesn't care. He's willing to risk it.
Aaron: 
Damon: What part of "he doesn't care" are you not registering?
Enzo: Where were we? Uh, ah, right. I was telling my story, and you were all politely listening. Huh? 
Enzo: I was waiting in the cage for him to release me, waiting for my friend, my cellmate, the only soul with whom I'd connected with in all those years of captivity.
Enzo: Then a fire starts, burns out of control, but Damon just can't get the damn cage open.
Enzo: He looks me in the eye as if he doesn't even recognize me, turns around, saves himself, leaving me to die.
Stefan: Well, you didn't die, obviously.
Enzo: No. Unfortunately I lived. I was spared by one of the scientists so I could spend another fifty years on a table being opened and closed. Now that we've all been acquainted, I'm gonna find something to wet my whistle. 
Stefan: 
Damon: It was the 1950s. I'm supposed to remember every moment of my life? 
Stefan: This guy was your cellmate for five years, you left him to die, he comes back, and you're completely unfazed?
Damon: 
Aaron: 
Damon: That's a timely revelation.
Aaron: Yeah. Well, you know, he's not gonna help me, why should I help him?
Damon: 
Enzo: Ah. It's frightening what you can find on campus these days.
Stefan: Knock yourself out. We're going with plan B.
Enzo: 
Damon: 
Stefan: 
Katherine: You didn't just propose spirit possession with a straight face.
Nadia: You said my grandfather was a Traveler, which means your father was a Traveler. Therefore, you are a Traveler. We just need to find one who can teach you how to do the Passenger Spell.
Katherine: Hang on. I'm hardly a Traveler, okay? My father banned us from doing Traveler magic. 
Nadia: But it's in your blood, which means you have the ability to keep living inside someone else's body. Gregor was a Traveler. He put his spirit inside Matt so that even after his body died he lived on.
Katherine: Yes! He lived on...in a busboy. Good idea, Nadia. Let's put my essence in some nobody. Thing is, Stefan actually likes this body.
Nadia: 
Katherine: 
Nadia: 
Katherine: Look. Maybe I don't want to die a sad, lonely 538-year-old. If I have to bow out, knowing that Stefan still cares might not be the worst way to go.
Nadia: 
Enzo: What about cricket? That ever become a thing here?
Damon: No.
Enzo: Oh, shame. Fun sport. Not that I can play. Took up drawing for a while. Of course I had no pencil, 
Damon: What do you want? You want me to feel guilty? I couldn't save you. Now, where's Elena?
Damon: What's wrong with you?
Enzo: Wes injected me with poison that will stop my heart. I'll desiccate if I don't return for the antidote.
Damon: 
Enzo: Did you even think about it after you left, the experiments, the cell, 
Damon: Look at me. If you go back, we go back together. We finish this for good. Come on.
Enzo: You're not gonna see your girl again, Damon, 
Enzo: I imagine you just broke your clavicle. Probably a few lumbar and thoracic vertebrae. It's funny what you learn about your body when it's taken apart like a bloody automobile right before your eyes!
Damon: 
Enzo: What are you gonna do then, run? You're good at that.
Damon: I want to find my girlfriend.
Enzo: While you were out running wild, I had one single thought, that I'd have the pleasure of killing you.
Damon: Enzo, look at me.
Enzo: Bloody poison!
Damon: Where is he? Where's Elena? Tell me where she is!
Enzo: Or what?! You never see her again? It might be good for you to know what it's like to miss someone for the next sixty years. 
Damon: Enzo, look at me. Hey! Enzo! Where is she? Where is she?
Aaron: All the files of my family history are in here.
Stefan: Hurry up.
Stefan: Was this all a lie, huh? If you want me to kill you, I will kill you. Do not test me.
Aaron: 
Stefan: What are you talking about?
Aaron: Damon left out the best part of the Augustine story, the part after he escaped.
Stefan: Talk.
Aaron: It wasn't enough for Damon to kill the doctors who tortured him. He had to torture their families and their future families. He spent the last sixty years killing every one of my relatives except he's a psychopath. He leaves one alive so that they can continue the family line so that he can destroy future generations of innocent people. So go ahead and do it, kill me because I don't want to give Damon the satisfaction, so do it. 
Stefan: You know, not all of us are like my brother.
Aaron: Stefan?
Aaron: This is everything Wes gave me on Augustine. I saw Elena's last name on a few pages. Maybe it will help.
Grayson: Hey. You're not supposed to be down here. Basement's a kid-free zone, remember?
Elena: I heard someone screaming.
Grayson: Oh, it's okay. Everything's fine. In fact, today's a good day, Elena.
Elena: Why?
Grayson: Daddy's gonna save a little girl's life. She's just about the same age as you. Pretty cool, huh? 
Elena: Okay, dad.
Maxfield: Good news. The sample cells mutated. My compound worked.
Elena: 
Maxfield: You've heard of Pavlov? Conditioned his dog to salivate at the sound of a bell. This compound is like that bell except instead of a ding, your body will salivate at the smell of vampire blood.
Elena: Oh, my God. That's what you did to Jesse. You turned him into some rabid vampire who only wanted to feed on other vampires.
Maxfield: Jesse was a fantastic case study, but he took too long to condition, and considering the size of the vampire population, a single-dose injection is much more efficient.
Elena: Yeah, but he couldn't stop feeding. He tried to kill Damon.
Maxfield: Exactly. Vampires are now one shot away from craving their own kind, 
Elena: What? No. No, you can't do that to me. 
Maxfield: I know.
Maxfield: 
Elena: No. Please. You can't do this to me.
Maxfield: You'll be doing the world a favor, Elena. 
Elena: No! Let me go!
Maxfield: ...but you will.
Elena: No. 
Stefan: Elena!
Elena: Stefan! 
Elena: I'm right here. I'm here.
Stefan: Oh, God. Ohh.
Elena: I'm here.
Stefan: Come here. 
Elena: Get me out of here.
Stefan: Come on. Come on.
Elena: Wait, wait, wait.
Matt: Look. We're closing, so...
Nadia: We met on a little patio like this, remember? The twinkling lights, music. That was a fun night.
Matt: Yeah. I'd kind of rather just put us, um, behind us.
Nadia: Fine. Will do, but I need you to hold on to this for me. 
Matt: The Travelers' knife? No way. I just got rid of that thing.
Nadia: It's not about you. I'm leaving Mystic Falls, and I need to know it's safe.
Matt: Why, and why do people want it?
Nadia: I thought I could convince Katherine to live a little longer. I was wrong, but if she changes her mind, she will need this. That's all you need to know.
Matt: 
Nadia: 
Matt: 
Nadia: Then you know what's like to hold on to the hope that maybe just once she'll do what you want.
Matt: 
Damon: Oh. Never mind.
Enzo: What did you do now?
Damon: Well, I injected you with a bunch of these that say "antidote" and apparently, one of them worked.
Enzo: 
Damon: I don't care about amends, mate. My girlfriend's safe, so technically, I'm not suffering, and it'd really suck if you desiccated in vain...
Damon: ...and I'm gonna tell you my side of the story. You asked me if I thought about you after I escaped, and answer is no, and I sure as hell don't feel guilty about leaving you because in order for me to save myself and leave you, I had to shut off my humanity, damn it, so I flipped the switch, and then I felt nothing, no remorse, no regret, no pain.
Enzo: And now what do you feel, remorse, regret, pain? Even if I forgave you, Damon, would that make you less of a horrible person? 
Damon: We're even, Enzo. 
Enzo: You were the most important person in my life, and you ruined me, but that's just who you are, that's who you'll always be...A monster.
Elena: It's weird. Even as a kid, there was something about that basement that creeped me out.
Damon: Sure you want to give yourself nightmares reading that thing? 
Elena: And I remember my dad talking about this little girl. I think he was talking about my roommate Megan. Look. "January 1999. Saw Megan King today. Megan is seven years old. She suffers from a congenital heart defect with a life expectancy of two months. A single injection of vampire blood appears to be an effective life-saving solution." That's why Megan had a picture of my dad on her phone -- because he saved her life.
Damon: A hundred pages of horrific torture, and you find the one happy passage.
Elena: My dad used his research to save people, Damon, children, families.
Damon: Yeah. And dissected vampires along the way. News flash, Elena. You are a vampire. I mean, do you honestly think that he would sit here and see you as anything more?
Elena: I don't know. He was my dad. I can't not defend him. 
Damon: 
Elena: I'm not defending you. I'm not defending your decision to kill Aaron's entire family, to go out of town and kill the aunt while we were still together.
Damon: 
Elena: 
Damon: Well, now I'm choosing, and I'm choosing to let you go.
Elena: What? No, Damon--
Damon: I am choosing to not have to think about how you must feel every time some ghost from my past comes into our life. I'm choosing to relieve you of having to defend me for every awful thing I've ever done.
Elena: Stop acting like I'm perfect. Damon, I've done horrible things, too. You think I'm gonna stand here and judge you after I find out that you've been tortured for five years?
Damon: (Shouting.) Stop defending me! (Composed.) I won't change who I am. I can't...But I refuse to change you.
Stefan: Can I come in, or are you gonna freak out and run away again?
Katherine: I'm getting wrinkles.
Stefan: Heh. Katherine Pierce's chickens come home to roost in the form of wrinkles. It's kind of brilliant.
Katherine: 
Stefan: Hmm. So what are you, uh, doing in my room?
Katherine: I want to talk about last night.
Stefan: Okay.
Katherine: So talk.
Stefan: 
Katherine: Did you memorize that from a textbook or something?
Stefan: Katherine, what do you expect? You want me just forget everything that you've put me through for the last 147 years?
Katherine: I'm dying, Stefan.
Stefan: I know you are, and I'm sure that you will figure a way out of it.
Katherine: No. I'm in this for real, this time. 
Stefan: 147 years is a long time to forgive in one night.
Katherine: 
Katherine: Good night, Stefan.
Stefan: Hey. 
Katherine: 
Aaron: Wes? Wes?
Maxfield: Aaron?
Aaron: 
Maxfield: It's one of Augustine's research labs.
Aaron: Do you really think that you're helping people with this vampire crap? You sold me out! You used my life as a bargaining chip.
Maxfield: Agh. 
Aaron: I never want to see you again. Get the hell out of my life.
Maxfield: 
Katherine: So, do we have a deal? You'll find me a traveler that will teach me how to do do the spell?
Nadia: 
Katherine: I'm a survivor. Staying alive is my specialty.
Nadia: Mm-hmm. Assuming of course it's on your terms. Clearly Stefan inspired some profound thinking.
Katherine: I think Stefan believes that a part of me that can still be redeemed.
Nadia: And what do you think? Is he right?
Katherine: Unh! 
Nadia: Hello?
Katherine: Ohh! 
Nadia:
