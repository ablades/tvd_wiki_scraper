Elena: Oh, my God. Stefan! She sits on the coffee table in front of the body.
Caroline: (sobbing) I didn't know where to bring him, and I just couldn't leave him outside.
Caroline: Bonnie has a plan, right? She—she said that she could bring people back. (neither Elena or Damon respond) Tell me that she can bring him back!
Damon: We'll bring him back. Come on. Let's get away from prying eyes.
Woman: I got you!
Lexi: Looks like I've now saved you from both metaphorical darkness and actual darkness. I think you owe me a beer.
CREDITS:
Bonnie: Damon, stop.
Damon: You said you had a plan, Bonnie.
Bonnie: I did. I had a traveler who knew the right spell.
Damon: And you lost her!
Bonnie: I didn't lose her. She was sucked into oblivion like everyone else on the Other Side.
Damon: Then find another one!
Bonnie: It's more than just knowing the spell. Markos was able to come back because dozens of Travelers were willing to sacrifice themselves in order to overwhelm me. I doubt they'll be willing to do that for a bunch of supernatural strangers.
Damon: (pointing at her with the rod) You know who needs motivation? (he gets close to her with the rod pointing at her neck) You need motivation because if the Other Side goes away, everyone we know there, including you, goes away with it.
Bonnie: I know that. Do you think I want to die?
Damon: My brother is over there.
Bonnie: I know that!
Damon: So is Alaric, and so is your grams.
Bonnie: I know that, Damon.
Enzo: *ahem* Let's not forget who else is at the top of the search and rescue list.
Bonnie: Enzo is here.
Damon: Well, if it's not Mr. Butterfingers himself. How'd it feel to have your only hope of coming back literally slip through your fingers?
Enzo: Hello to you, too, grumpy pants. (to Bonnie) Tell him to play nice. I have a plan.
Bonnie: (to Enzo) Are you serious? You found another Traveler?
Damon: (in Enzo's direction) Well, then get on it!
Enzo: I'm already on it, mate. You still need someone to do this coming back from the dead spell. I assume you still have a witch or two in your pocket
Bonnie: More or less.
Liv: Oh great. Grandma just passed us.
Luke: If you want to drive, just say so.
Liv: No. I want you to drive, just at a speed more fitting for two people who just tried to commit murder.
Luke: They are not following us. Markos stripped the town of spirit magic. There's now way they survived it.
Liv: (looking straight ahead) Something tells me they did.
Luke: And I bet if I turn around...
Liv: Using our own tricks against us. (she takes off her seat belt) Jerks.
Elena: A little tip. If you're gonna flee the scene of the crime, take back roads.
Liv: Do you really want to do this, again?
Elena: You mean the part where you try to kill a doppelgänger? There's no point. Stefan's already dead.
Liv: I know you don't believe me, but I *am* sorry.
Elena: Good because you're gonna help bring him back.
Liv: Look. I get what you need from us, but if both doppelgängers are alive again, the Travelers can restart their spell. Witch magic goes bye-bye, and all you vamps, you're goners.
Elena: They're not gonna have a chance to start again because in order to bring Stefan back, we're gonna have to kill them, a lot of them, including Markos.
Luke: We can't help you. Even if we wanted to, our coven would kill us.
Caroline: Stefan saved your life.
Luke: I know he did, but—
Liv: We can't risk it.
Liv: No!
Caroline: Your brother's officially on the Other Side. Think you can risk it now?
Markos: It is a good day, Sheriff.
Liz: Maybe for you. It took me all night to evacuate the 10-mile civilian radius around the Town Square.
Markos: Hmm. Gas leak. Very clever. I appreciate your cooperation.
Liz: It will keep our residents away for now but certainly not forever.
Markos: I'm sure we can think of something if we put our heads together.
Liz: Why did they move our sign?
Markos: Our desire was to end spirit magic everywhere. As you can see, we hit a snag. Nevertheless, this is our home now, and just to keep things simple, we've reset the official border of Mystic Falls to where the spell begins, right there.
Liz: Of all the small towns to call home, you probably shouldn't have picked one full of vampires.
Markos: You think I'm afraid of vampires? Maybe you think your friend Damon or your daughter can come save the day. (they start walking) Let me give you an example of why that would be unwise.
Liz: Tyler!
Markos: Oh, that's not Tyler anymore. That's Julian, the Traveler who betrayed his people when he killed the doppelgänger and stopped the spell. A big, scary werewolf-vampire hybrid, and yet a little vervain, a touch of wolfsbane, and here you are—weak and all mine.
Julian: You think you're some great leader because you pillage a helpless town? That makes you king now? Sorry, your highness, but I don't buy it.
Markos: That's because you haven't set foot inside my kingdom. (Julian looks at him confused; Markos turns around) The spell the Travelers cast across Mystic Falls eliminates spirit magic, so while my people continue to have access to the Earth's purest magic, (he turns to face Julian/Tyler again) your friend Tyler will be stripped of everything the witches did to him, first his hybrid side, then his vampirism, and with no vampirism to keep him alive, he'll just be a boy with a werewolf gene, who happened to break his neck.
Julian: No, no! No! (the men holding him try to hold him tighter as Julian tries to break free) Don't do this! No! No! Stop. (they force Julian to cross the city limit)
Liz: Oh, my God.
:
Enzo: One less witch twin in the world.
Bonnie: (now facing Enzo) No. One more person we need to bring back.
Enzo: This list is getting uncomfortably long.
Bonnie: Tell me about it, but with Liv doing the spell, not bringing her brother back would be just--
Enzo: Smart, savvy?
Bonnie: Cruel. It would be cruel, but none of it matters if your mysterious Traveler doesn't show.
Tyler: (off screen) Bonnie?
Bonnie: (disconcerted, she looks behind her and sees Tyler) Tyler, is that you?
Tyler: How the hell did I get here?
Bonnie: You're dead, and you're you. Caroline was right. (they walk closer to each other) Dying eliminated your passenger.
Tyler: Hang on. Did you say I'm dead?
Bonnie: I did, but we can bring you back.
Enzo: And the list keeps growing.
Bonnie: I need you to trust me, OK?
Tyler: Do I have a choice?
Damon: Class is in session. First assignment—Anti-magic perimeter. Gilbert, whataya got?
Jeremy: I walked around Mystic Falls this morning to see where my hunter instincts disappeared.
Damon: Meaning what, your biceps shrunk, and your brain got smaller?
Jeremy: Meaning that I have a supernatural urge to kill vampires, so wherever I hated you less, there was no magic.
Damon: (they look down at a map of Mystic Falls, which has a big red circle drawn on it to determine the limits of the no-magic area) The cemetery's outside of the no-magic perimeter, a couple of un-populated areas other than that.
Caroline: (on the phone, on speaker) Hey, Professor Salvatore, not everyone can see the map.
Elena: (also on the phone) Yeah, don't forget about us.
Damon: Donovan, you had one job.
Matt: I'll send you a picture right now.
Elena: (into Caroline's phone) We should be there.
Damon: Nope. You should not be. You are on witch duty because without crazy locks, no one's rising from the dead. So next order of business, mass murder. Quarterback?
Damon: Thank you. OK. We got these from the Sheriff. Apparently there was some truth to her evacuation story. There's a major gas line that runs underneath the town. Now if it did leak, it could be deadly, as in massive explosion kind of deadly.
Matt: We can't blow up our hometown.
Damon: Says one of the only people left in this group who can actually live there.
Elena: We're not blowing up our town. We just need to lure enough Travelers to one spot.
Caroline: How? We can't lure anyone anywhere stuck out here.
Damon: And that's where your mama comes in. She will convince them to gather somewhere inside. Meanwhile, these two geniuses at 7:00 will turn on the gas, let it leak. We'll have about 10 minutes before anyone can smell it. You clear out. Boom! Travelers gone, resurrection spell starts, loved ones return. Good? Good? Class dismissed.
Lexi: Huh. I thought for sure he'd be here. If you were a history teacher turned vampire, where else would you be?
Stefan: You seem very intent on finding somebody you barely know.
Lexi: Well, I have a thing for day drinkers. Plus he has a cute name. Alaric. Hmm.
Stefan: (leaning on the bar and smiling) We'll find him.
Lexi: (looking down at a plate of food on the bar) Seriously? This is what I have to look forward to when I come back to life? All-you-can-eat potato skins?
Stefan: Hmm.
Lexi: Remind me again why you never made it to Portland.
Stefan: I was attacked by Silas and locked in a safe to drown for three months.
Lexi: Right, and then you made it out, and yet you're still here.
Stefan: Lexi, either one of us could blink out of existence any second, so if you have something to say to me—
Lexi: Caroline.
Stefan: What about Caroline?
Lexi: Wow! You really don't see it, do you?
Stefan: See what?
Liz: Listen. I might not carry a lot of weight with you people, but I am still the Sheriff and I still represent the people who live here.
Markos: Travelers haven't been able to gather together for centuries. The last thing they'll tolerate is a list if your ground rules.
Liz: (looking around) What if there's an open bar?
Stefan: (to Lexi) She's trying to gather the Travelers. They're planning something.
Jeremy: I should go with you.
Bonnie: You need to go be a younger, hotter Bruce Willis, and if I take one step into Mystic Falls, good-bye magic, good-bye anchor, good-bye me.
Jeremy: At least tell me how this works.
Bonnie: Being an anchor is like being a gateway. Usually, it's one way, but when the Travelers die, Liv will do the spell, and her magic combined with all those Travelers opening the gate at once will allow the people on the Other Side to push their way through me like Markos did.
Jeremy: (concerned) What about you? What happens?
Bonnie: I stop being the anchor.
Jeremy: Yeah, but how do you get through?
Bonnie: (with teary eyes) Jeremy, I will be fine. Look. I got to go, OK? Be careful. (she hangs up.)
Enzo: What is your plan exactly?
Bonnie: My plan is my job... just like the spell is yours, which apparently you suck at. Should already be on the road.
Silas: I'm late, aren't I? My bad. I was watching some 80-year-old witch get dragged off to never, never land. It was uh—weirdly entertaining.
Bonnie: Stefan.
Enzo: Not exactly. Bonnie, meet the Traveler with our one-way ticket out of here, although you may know him better as an ancient immortal with a desperate need of a cure.
Bonnie: Oh, my God. Silas. You killed my dad.
Silas: And now, I'm gonna help you bring your friends back to life and me along with them. So, what do you say? Bygones?
:
Stefan: Where the hell is Alaric?
Lexi: I don't know. Maybe he finally found peace, although if he did, I'm going to be super pissed he beat me.
Stefan: Well, why didn't you? I mean, if anyone was going to find peace, it should be you.
Lexi: I don't know. Maybe there's something I'm still supposed to do. You know, like, earn my stripes.
Stefan: All right. Let's make a deal. If all this fails and you and I are stuck over here, we're not going to let whatever's happening to all these people happen to us. We're going to find peace together.
Lexi: A death peace pact?
Lexi: I like it.
Lexi: Come on. Let's go. I would hate for you to miss your come-back-to-life window before you even had your first date with Caroline.
Stefan: Oh, shut it.
Silas:  Az vezat esvet.
: Az vezat esvat.
Silas: (correcting her) Esvet, not -vat. I feel like I'm teaching calculus to an infant.
Bonnie: I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous about unleashing a plague onto humanity.
Silas: Ooh! I've been upgraded to a plague? Oh. How biblical and fitting, seeing as I probably will kill a lot of people in an epic, all-inclusive way once I'm out of here.
Silas:  Oh, speaking of, how is my shadow self? Is it a crime for someone so good-looking to be so sad all the time?
Bonnie: Just teach me the damn spell.
Elena: Hey. Did you find a Traveler that's going to get us out of here?
Bonnie: Yep. Learning the spell as we speak. I'd introduce you, but, um--
Elena:  (speaking to no one in particular) Thank you, whoever you are.
Silas:  Oh. Just the perfect specimen of man, that's all.
Bonnie: (sarcastically) Moody old lady. Kind of senile.
Elena: Got it. Well, I'm going to go call Damon, and let him know that we're ready.
Matt: Can we talk about the irony in us blowing up the only place dumb enough to hire us?
Jeremy:  I'm sure the Salvatores will make a generous contribution to help fix it.
Matt: Yeah, if they can come home. No one said killing the Travelers will get rid of this anti-magic thing, although Mystic Falls might be a half-decent place to live in again. No more vampire attacks, crazy blood rituals, you know? Safe like it use to be.
Jeremy: Except I wouldn't be able to invite my girlfriend over.
Matt: There are worse things than having to visit your girlfriend at college on the weekends, Jer. It's called "normal."
Jeremy: We're here.
Markos: (stepping in front of her) I warned you they probably wouldn't give you the chance to speak.
Liz: Well, they don't seem to have a problem with the free food.
Markos: (blocking her from leaving) Where are you going?
Liz: Well, I'm clearly not going to have much of an impact here, so I think it's time I take my own orders and evacuate.
Markos: We're not lawless, you know. We could use someone like you, have a drink with me. Allow me to convince you that this can still be your home.
Liz: My home is a place my daughter can come visit. Goodbye.
Markos: Please. I insist.
Elena: So are you good?
Damon: Operation Massacre... assuming Donovan knows the difference between a water-main and a gas-main.. yeah, I'm good.
Damon: Listen.. I wanted to spare you the gory details, and then I figured, well, I'll be lying, and then the whole point of saving the universe would be moot because you'd be pissed. So here it is; Project Kaboom needs someone to trigger the explosion, so-to-speak.
Elena: Okay... wait—you? No. Damon, no! Absolutely not.
: Go with your first instinct Damon, lesson learned
Elena: Look at me, Damon.
Elena: Do you see a future with me? Because that's all I see.
Damon: Elena, I've seen it since the second I laid my eyes on you.
Elena: Then don't go on a suicide mission!
Damon: Listen... technically, it's only half a suicide mission because we're going to be bringing people back from the other side and I'm going to be with them.
Elena: Well, what if something goes wrong?
Damon: Alright... not to relive old fights, but this is my choice. I need you to respect it.
Elena: That was a low blow...
Damon: I will make it back to you, I promise.
Damon: I promise you.
:
Enzo: Is everything all right in there?
Bonnie: Yeah. We're good, but Silas is a crappy mentor, FYI.
Enzo: It's back.
: She's ready. Let's get on with it.
: Help me.
Bonnie: Bygones.
:59 pm.)
Liv: 
: You can do this, Liv.
Liv: 
Matt: Alright. It's 7 o'clock on the dot.  Let's go.
Bonnie: Come on, Grams. Where are you?
Bennet: Didn't I tell you not to rush your elders? We move a little slower.
Bonnie: Thank god! I found us all a way out.
Bennet: Do you think I was born yesterday? I know what you're doing. You can't survive all these people coming through you... and even if you could, when it's all said and done, you're still the anchor, and when this places goes...
: I know what you're about to say.
Bennet: No you don't. I was going to say that it's been my privledge to watch you grow into the beautiful woman you've become.
Bonnie: You need to pass through me when the ritual begins.
Bennet: No. I'm staying here.
Bonnie: Grams... You can't. This place is imploding and taking everyone with it.
Bennet: I can't come, Bonnie. You're not the only member of this family that knows how to make a sacrifice.
Bonnie: What does that mean?
Bennet: It means that I'm going to be fine. I found peace because I made sure that you'll find yours.
Bonnie: I don't understand...
Bennet: Not your concern. Just know that I looked out for you.
Bennet: I love you Bonnie. You stay strong.
Bonnie: I love you.
Markos: Another phone call in five minutes...
Liz: What am I doing here?
Markos: You know, I was wondering the same thing. You evacuated the town, yet you stayed behind to lecture us on our civic duties?
Liz: A captain goes down with his ship...
Markos: Or you're up to something.
Liz: Do you smell gas?
Liz: I think there's a leak coming from the hatch.
Damon: What the hell are you doing?
Elena: You said to respect your choice and I did. Now, I need you to respect mine.
Damon: Woah. No. No. That's not how this works, Elena. The second we cross the border, you're going to feel everything... You're going to drown all over again. It's going to take you back to the night you died as a human.
Elena: I know what I signed up for, Damon and I'm all in.
Elena: What are you staring at? Drive!
:
Elena: Hurry! We have to die while we're still vampires, or..
: No!
: Come on!
Elena: Damon...
Damon: I know...
Liv: 
Liv: 
Luke: Keep going.
Markos: We meet again... We can do this all day, Bonnie. Your friends kill me and I come right back through you. I look forward to the déjà vu.
Liv: 
Elena: Bonnie!
Bonnie: Elena! Did it work? Are you???
Elena: Yes!
: Yeah?
Elena: Did Damon?
: I'm right here.
Bonnie: Okay. When you guys pass through me, you're going to wake up with your bodies on the other side. I need you to get back here as fast as you can.
Damon: Okay.
Alaric: Did you seriously wear your seatbelt?
Elena: Oh my god! Alaric, what are you doing he—
Alaric: Come on. You gotta go.
Elena: But what about Damon? I need to find him.
Alaric: No, you need to go home to your brother. I'll find Damon.
Elena: I can't!
Alaric: Go on. Elena, get out of here. Go.
Elena: Okay.
Damon: Liz! No. No. No. No.
Alaric: Friendly advice: When you finally get the girl, don't blow her up.
: Good to see you too, buddy.
Alaric: Yeah.
Alaric: I think she's going to be okay.
Liv: 
Luke: BONNIE!
Luke: Bonnie! Hey! It's too much for her. We need to start now!
Stefan: No! We need to go together. Damon isn't here yet.
Luke: I don't care.
Liv: 
Luke: Hey.
Luke: You need to stop, now. Okay? If you keep going, it's going to kill you.
Liv: No. I promised that I'd help them.
Liv: 
: You need to come through.
Tyler: What about everybody else?
Enzo: You don't have to tell me twice.
Enzo: Ahh! See you around, gorgeous.
Caroline: Tyler?
Tyler: Yeah! It's me.
Tyler: Woah..
Caroline: What's wrong?
Tyler: That felt different..
Caroline: What do you mean?
Caroline: You're not healing...
Tyler: I'm not a hybrid anymore.
Bonnie: Come on guys, we don't have much time. Grab my hand!
Lexi: (to Stefan): Go. GO!
Stefan: No.
Lexi: You have to go! Come on!
Elena: I can't find Damon!
Stefan: You go. I'll wait here.
Elena: No I'm not leaving without him!
Stefan: This place is falling apart.
Elena: No!
Caroline: Elena! Thank God!
Elena: No! Bonnie! Why would you do that?! I can't leave without him!
Bonnie: We'll find him!
Caroline: Wait? What's going on? Who are we missing? Where's Stefan?!
Elena: Are you okay?
Caroline: Oh my god! Bonnie?
Stefan: No. No. No.
Caroline: Stefan!
Stefan: I was just trying...
Caroline: What's wrong?
Stefan: She fell. I was just trying—
Caroline: What?
Stefan: Damon. He's not there yet.
: This isn't happening.
Bonnie: It's okay. I can do this.
Lexi: Bonnie; This is killing you, isn't it?
Bonnie: I can hold on. I have to. Just come through. We have to finish this!
: Not just yet!
Bonnie: Lexi! Come on! It's you turn!
Lexi: Every person that passes through takes you one step closer to death. What kind of a best friend would I be if you died before Stefan got his brother back?
Lexi: You're not going to get me.
Liv: 
: Bonnie!
Bonnie: Thank god!
Liv: 
Luke: Screw those guys.
Luke: I won't let you die for them.
Luke: Phasmatos Fumos Extas
Damon: Where's Elena?
Bonnie: She made it through.
Damon: Okay.
Bonnie: Come on
Damon: Well, would you look at that...
:
Elena: Oh my god. Liv!
Elena: Bonnie! We need to find them. We need to start the spell again.
Bonnie: We can't! That was our one shot.
Elena: Yeah, but Damon is on the other side, we have to—
Bonnie: ELENA...
Bonnie: It's too late.
Elena: No.
Bonnie: He's here. You can say good-bye.
Stefan: I lost them both.. Two people I've known longest in this world... both gone.
Caroline: Lexy?
Stefan: She never came out. Neither did Markos. I know that's not a conicidence. It was, uh, her, unfinished buisness. And Damon—uh—he finally had everything he wanted. He was happy. He should be here.
: You lied to me.
Damon: Even if I wanted to apologize, you couldn't hear me... so I won't.
Elena: Please, don't leave me.
Damon: I don't have a choice, baby. You are, by far, the greatest thing that ever happened to me in my 173 years on this Earth. I get to die knowing I was loved—not just by anyone—by you, Elena Gilbert. It's the epitome of a fulfilled life. It’s never gonna get any better than this. I peaked.
Damon: I love you, Elena
Elena: Please... please... come back to me.
Damon: Bye.
: I lied. There was never any way for me to stop being the anchor. When the other side goes, I go with it.
Jeremy: You told me you could come back.
Bonnie: If I told you the truth, it would have changed our last days together and I didn't want it to change. We were happy.
Jeremy: So none of it was true?
Jeremy: Bonnie. Don't move!  Okay, I—I'm coming to you.
Bonnie: I died Jer, the day before graduation. And the rest of this has been a gift. I choose to be thankful that I didn't waste a second of it. So, take care of Elena.
Jeremy: No! NO! Don't you dare hang up on me.
: I love you
Jeremy: Bonnie. Don't you dare.
Matt: The main-gas line is off, Jer... Jer...
Jeremy: I need to get to Bonnie.
Elena: He's gone...
Jeremy: Bonnie! Bonnie!
Tyler: What's going on?
Jeremy: Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie!
Damon: This place is going down, isn't it?
Bonnie: It is. I'm sure there are a million people we'd rather be with right now, but...
: A couple thousand, at most.
Bonnie: Do you think it'll hurt?
Damon: I don't kn—
