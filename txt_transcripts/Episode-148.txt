PENNY: What do you want?
VAMPIRE: Just looking for a bite.
PENNY: Oh God. You're a vampire.
VAMPIRE: And you're lunch.
PENNY: Shouldn't he be turning all gray?
PENNY: All the other ones turned gray. Unless, of course, you missed.
MATT: 
PENNY: 
MATT: He's got a thick jacket on. I can't exactly see where his heart is.
PENNY: Outerwear? That's your excuse?
MATT: You gonna stand there and brag all day, or are you gonna help me load him into the car? We gotta get him out of here before the--
KRYSTAL: Julian's other vampires get suspicious? Too late.
KRYSTAL: Touch it and die. Actually, why don't you die anyway?
PENNY: You saved our lives.
RAYNA: Yes, I did. Which means you owe me one. You ever heard of a vampire named Stefan Salvatore?
STEFAN: You mind just paying attention to the road a little bit more?
VALERIE: Well, I could, but then I might miss the world's largest ball of yarn coming up on the left... And there it goes. Not quite sure what I was expecting.
STEFAN: Well, that was the last of Freya's herbs, which means its only a matter of time before they wear off and Rayna can track me.
VALERIE: Good thing we're on our way to get more.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: We have to take back roads to avoid being spotted.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: You've only been running a few days, Stefan. Think of it like it's an adventure!
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: Then do what? Pay bills? Talk about your day? Ugh.
STEFAN: Well, you don't actually enjoy this, do you?
VALERIE: Mmm. There's a certain constant in the lack of constants. And, once you accept it, it's invigorating.
VALERIE: We're here.
VALERIE: What is this place?
STEFAN: Well, according to Freya, all the herbs witches use are stored here. Just in case something happens to them.
VALERIE: All of them?
STEFAN: Yeah.
VALERIE: Well, I hope you know what this particular herb looks like.
STEFAN: And why is that?
VALERIE: Because witches are very fond of their herbs.
DAMON: Oh, good! You're up. How's Bonica-magica?
BONNIE: Not great, but... good enough to make sure you never call me that again.
DAMON: 
BONNIE: Someone's cheery.
DAMON: Well, I'm a man with a plan!
BONNIE: Which is...?
DAMON: 
BONNIE: Does it have to do with killing Rayna the Huntress?
DAMON: 
BONNIE: Good. How can I help?
DAMON: 
BONNIE: It's Damon versus Cray-na, because that one gets you right back in Hell. You don't even know how to kill her.
BONNIE: But, you know who might?
DAMON: 
BONNIE: Enzo's been calling me non-stop-- probably to apologize for yesterday. I bet if I go back to the Armory, I can find out more info.
BONNIE: What the hell?
DAMON: Look around, Bonnie. I'm not here for the filmy hospital pudding. You almost died in that place, and I'll never let that happen again.
DAMON: Promise me you will stay out of this, Bon. No one needs to get hurt for me anymore. I can handle Rayna.
RAYNA: Here's where we stand-- I've killed five of your friends because they couldn't tell me where Stefan Salvatore was. I sure hope you can.
RAYNA: You two, watch and learn. The key is to treat them like you would a wild animal. Respecting the danger, but recognizing that they're beneath you, and that they serve a purpose. For example, this one will provide information.
RAYNA: Tell me everything you know about Stefan Salvatore, or I'll send you to Hell for eternity.
DAMON: Barking up the wrong vampire, there, sister. Stefan's antisocial. Not many friends. Actually, no friends at all. But, I hear he has a very handsome and charming brother. You might want to talk to him.
RAYNA: Yeah, a stupid brother. Seems foolish of you to come back here.
DAMON: I know, right? To be honest... I'm not that brave. However, I did have a shockingly effective ally tell me that you were here.
PENNY: What the hell did you do?
MATT: 
DAMON: Aw, you almost said "friend." How sweet!
MATT: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: Get rid of this thing.
MATT: 
DAMON: Yeah-- you know where I can get a buzz-saw?
DAMON: Ugh. Here we go.
DAMON: They're my girlfriend's. And, given the fact that you two look exactly alike, you should be able to fit into them.
RAYNA: 
DAMON: It wouldn't have to if it just stayed dead.
DAMON: Bit of a pickle here, Ray. I got big plans.
RAYNA: You buy a time share?
DAMON: Kind of, actually. But, I can't go on vacation until I do something about you. See, I can't relax and sip Mai Tais while you're out hunting my brother. And, every time I kill you, you just Phoenix back to life.
DAMON: It's a dill.
RAYNA: Well, why don't you just let me kill your brother, then you can do whatever you want?
DAMON: Tempting. Truly. But, I kind of owe him.
RAYNA: Family, am I right? That's why you and I have to put our heads together and come up with a Plan B.
RAYNA: 
DAMON: 
RAYNA: Funny thing is... Family's the very reason this is my nature. My father envisioned a world without vampires. I will not rest until I see his vision through.
VALERIE: So, what do you propose we do? Rub each one on your wound and hope for the best?
STEFAN: I don't know. You're a witch-- why have you never heard of this?
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: There's wolfsbane. Vervain. Senna. Witch hazel. And this fun little guy...
STEFAN: Mmm, that one I know.
VALERIE: The witchy hallucinogen. The one borderline-recreational herb.
VALERIE: Stefan, I misjudged you! You actually do have fun.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: With someone like you, there's always a bad influence.
STEFAN: Well, her name was Rebekah. Let's just say she was a lot to handle.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: I don't think anyone's ever called Caroline Forbes "easy to handle." And, as thrilling as this therapy session is...
STEFAN: I think I found it. Or, where it used to be.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: What is it?
WOMAN: Night, night.
ENZO: You actually came. I'm shocked.
BONNIE: So, did it grow back, or...?
ENZO: No, actually.
ENZO: I had to reattach it. But thank you for your concern.
BONNIE: Less concern, more curiosity...
ENZO: Well, at least you're thinking of me. I take it you received my messages?
BONNIE: I did. And, I'm not stupid enough to think that your apologies were anything other than a tactic to get you here. But, here I am.
BONNIE: Fair warning-- if you try to disable my magic again, you'll wish I only cut off your hand.
ENZO: 
BONNIE: Mmm, I forgot. You two used to be friends. And now you have none.
ENZO: 
ALEX: Lorenzo.
ALEX: You must be Bonnie Bennett. I'm Alex St. John. Welcome to the Armory.
ALEX: I'm sorry for Enzo's behavior yesterday.
ALEX: He wasn't following proper protocol. I asked him to call you back here.
ALEX: Might've gotten off on the wrong foot.
BONNIE: 
ENZO: Not funny.
ALEX: 
ALEX: Rayna Cruz is a common enemy. We should be working together to fight her.
BONNIE: But you don't want to fight her. You want her captured. So, I think you know a lot more than you're letting on. Makes it hard for me to trust you.
ALEX: Fair. Why don't you come with me?
ALEX: This room contains everything the Armory has gathered on Rayna Cruz. List of victims, her lineage, the spell used to create her...
ALEX: And, most importantly, the shamans that gave their lives for her. The eight Everlastings.
BONNIE: You mean two Everlastings. The other six look pretty "lasted."
ALEX: There should be three preserved corpses.
ALEX: We lost another one? Did you know about this? Why wasn't I told?
ENZO: It must have just happened.
ALEX: Damnit!
BONNIE: i take it from her subtle shift in attitude that's a bad thing?
ENZO: Every time Rayna dies, one of the bodies decays. We've lost quite a few this past week, and if we lose all of them, Rayna dies for good.
DAMON: So... hunting vampires is your identity. Your fundamental "This is who I am" in a nutshell.
DAMON: You ever wonder if there's a way to change that?
RAYNA: 
DAMON: 
RAYNA: 
DAMON: Because I changed. Temporarily, as it were, but it happened. Just took the right person.
RAYNA: I don't need a vampire matchmaker. But thanks.
DAMON: Well, I mean, have you ever even tried? Has there ever been a... Mr. Hunter? Huh?
DAMON: Ohh. There has been.
DAMON: 
DAMON: Hmm. Never mind. Looks like I don't have to pretend I care.
ENZO: You have five seconds to tell me exactly what's happening, or you're not leaving here alive.
BONNIE: 
ENZO: 
BONNIE: I didn't do anything. Damon, on the other hand--
ENZO: 
BONNIE: 
ENZO: No, because every time Rayna dies, she comes back stronger!
BONNIE: 
ENZO: 
ENZO: This is the spell those shamans used to create her.
BONNIE: 
ENZO: 
SHAMAN: Great Spirit, we call upon you in this moment of need.
SHAMAN: 
BONNIE: The sword. It has linking magic. It creates a bond between Rayna and her victims.
BONNIE: We knew that.
ENZO: Well, that's not all. The shamans didn't want her going to her eternal rest with any unfinished business, so they added an extra addendum.
BONNIE: The scars are...
BONNIE: ...A fail-safe. If Rayna dies... so does anyone she's marked.
ENZO: Stefan has one of those scars, doesn't he?
DAMON: I'm not happy about you going against my wishes. But, I do suppose that me lecturing anyone on lecturing authority...
BONNIE: Where's Rayna?
DAMON: In the woods, in a moderately shallow grave. You know, I got tired of digging, but it should do the trick.
BONNIE: 
DAMON: 
BONNIE: 
DAMON: 
BONNIE: The wounds from her sword? It's linked to her victims. If Rayna dies one last time... so does Stefan.
VALERIE: There you are.
STEFAN: What did she do to me?
WOMAN: Apologies.
WOMAN: I haven't had visitors in years. And then, all of a sudden, two in a matter of days.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: 
WOMAN: Unfortunately, there is no more. That herb is rare for a reason. It has strong anti-magic-- and therefore anti-witch-- properties.
WOMAN: Let's just say this isn't from a bad laser-peel.
STEFAN: There has to be more somewhere.
WOMAN: There's not. Witches eradicated it from the world a century ago. This was the only source.
DAMON: 
PENNY: So, there are good vampires and bad vampires?
MATT: Yes.
MATT: Kind of. It's complicated.
PENNY: And this is a bad vampire, one that killed your sister?
MATT: 
PENNY: Because you're helping his brother... who's a good vampire?
MATT: Exactly.
PENNY: So, this good vampire... does he feed on people, too? Does he kill them?
MATT: Stefan... I mean, not right now, but...
PENNY: ...It's complicated?
PENNY: The thing is, I've just spent the last few days with you, learning about how much you hate vampires and what they did to your town.
MATT: I do--
PENNY: And yet, you just helped one of them take down a vampire-killing machine. That doesn't sound complicated.
MATT: 
PENNY: You're right. I don't. But, I do wonder how much of it you went through because you never took a real stand. At a certain point, it stops being the vampires' fault that the town is like this... and it starts to be yours.
DAMON: Here we go. Come on. Where the hell are you? Come one! Be alive. Be alive!
CAROLINE: Bottles are a go!
ALARIC: Whew! Diapers also a go. Like, go away with them. Ugh!
ALARIC: Sorry.
CAROLINE: Ugh.
CAROLINE: Oh, hey!
STEFAN: Hey. Is this a bad time?
CAROLINE: I guess that's relative. I mean, I'm not on the run from a supernatural huntress. How are you?
STEFAN: Oh, I've been better. Looks like it might actually be a while before I can visit. Turns out, those herbs are a little more rare than we thought.
CAROLINE: Oh. Yeah... Hey, that's totally okay. Honestly, there's a chance there was a little bit of contamination going on, so maybe that's not the worst thing.
STEFAN: Hey, listen-- I was thinking, um... I've been on the run with Valerie for the last few days, and without those herbs, I'm not going to be able to slow down. But, maybe you could tag in...? I know being on the road seems awful, but it could be fun. We could go to Europe. See the world. Just you and me. What do you think?
CAROLINE: Stefan...
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: He needs you.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: So, out of curiosity, what are your feelings about Dallas?
STEFAN: Dallas? Uh... I hadn't really thought about it.
CAROLINE: Well, it's not a terrible place to live. And, you know, the babies are here...
ALARIC: Backup! I need backup right now! And more diapers.
CAROLINE: I'm sorry, Stefan. I gotta run.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: I love you, too.
VALERIE: She's staying, isn't she?
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: We'll figure something out.
VALERIE: Stefan! Hey...
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: What's happening?
DAMON: Please be alive.
VALERIE: Stefan!
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: Stefan?
VALERIE: Stefan!
DAMON: Come on! Drink!
DAMON: No. Damnit!
VALERIE: Stefan!
DAMON: Breathe! Come on, Rayna! Breathe!
VALERIE: I can't siphon it. It's not working.
DAMON: Breathe! I said BREATHE!
DAMON: Thank God.
DAMON: 
RAYNA: "Uh-oh" is right.
ENZO: What the hell are you doing?
BONNIE: You said she gets stronger each time she comes back to life. Damon can't kill her. He's walking into a fight he can't win.
ENZO: The Armory is on their way to Mystic Falls. They'll be there soon.
BONNIE: Not soon enough. She's connected to an Everlasting. Maybe I can weaken it... and her.
ENZO: And maybe that will kill her, and Stefan, too.
BONNIE: 
ENZO: You're willing to kill for him? Do you really think he cares that much about you?
BONNIE: Yeah, I do.
ENZO: 
DAMON: You want to talk about Mr. Huntress now, huh? Turns out, I'm very interested in this particular moment.
RAYNA: He was a vampire.
DAMON: Well, what do you know! Vampire-human affairs are my specialty.
RAYNA: They were mine, too. They don't work out in the long run... considering I staked him.
RAYNA: Go ahead. Run. I don't mind chasing a second Salvatore.
DAMON: 
RAYNA: 
DAMON: On second thought...
RAYNA: Don't say I never offered you anything.
DAMON: Well, if I could kill you, this would be a much fairer fight.
RAYNA: Your brother's dead, no matter what. All you've done by saving my life is gotten yourself killed.
RAYNA: Don't worry. I don't miss.
SOLDIER: Fire!
DAMON: 
ALEX: 
ALEX: Rayna is officially in captivity. Where's the Bennett witch?
ENZO: 
ALEX: 
ENZO: 
ALEX: Yes, Rayna was the first priority. Bonnie Bennett is a close second.
STEFAN: Ah. Looking for a bottle to celebrate? I gotta say, I'm impressed. Got your text. I didn't think you'd be able to kill her.
DAMON: 
read: "She's taken care of."
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: What? So, you didn't kill her?
DAMON: I did. A number of times. As it turns out, she only has eight lives. The last one's the problem. Turns out that if she dies for good, everyone with that scar on your chest does, as well.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: No. But, the good news is, the Armory has her, and they're not gonna let her escape.
STEFAN: Except for that time they did.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Caroline's staying in Dallas with Ric and the kids.
DAMON: Sorry to hear that, brother. But, I saw that coming.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: As long as I have this scar, Rayna will hunt me. This isn't about just you and me anymore-- there's kids involved. I'm not gonna put them in danger, which means that I can't be with my girlfriend as long as Rayna is alive. And you just told me she can never died, so we have to figure out another way to get rid of her, or we need to get rid of this scar.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: What is this?
DAMON: 
STEFAN: So, you're just gonna run away?
DAMON: Nope. I'm gonna stay in one place. Desiccated, right next to her.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Listen to me. If there's even a fraction of you that cares about me-- your brother, your family-- you will not walk out that door.
DAMON: Save a good bottle of that bourbon for me, brother. We're gonna need it to sort all this out in about sixty years.
STEFAN: Really not the best time, Matt.
MATT: This won't take long.
STEFAN: I don't want to have to kick you out of here, but I will.
MATT: 
STEFAN: Excuse me?
MATT: Vampires need to leave Mystic Falls... for good. All of you.
STEFAN: 
MATT: This is footage from the Grill today... of Damon doing some very not-human things to Rayna. I've got footage of you, too. Hundreds of hours from the town surveillance system. Now... I don't want to show it to anyone or expose you...
STEFAN: 
MATT: Yeah, I am. And I hate that. I hate that I have to threaten my friend because he's a vampire. I hate that I'm friends with vampires at all. This isn't about me. Or you. This is about our home, which has been destroyed time and time again. This is the only way to break that cycle. You have until the end of the day. Damon, too.
DAMON: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: 
BONNIE: You weren't even gonna say goodbye?
BONNIE: Enzo told me you asked him for Elena's coffin. He told me what you were planning. I didn't believe him. I thought... "If Damon desiccates until Elena wakes up, I'll never see him again."
BONNIE: "He'd never do that."
DAMON: 
BONNIE: Are we friends?
DAMON: 
BONNIE: 
BONNIE: Are we friends?
BONNIE: I know why you wanted to do this in a letter-- so you could desiccate in peace, imagining whatever reaction you wanted. Me reading it and thinking, "Huh. I'm really gonna miss him." Well, too bad, because that's not my reaction-- this is. I am not okay with this decision. I'm not okay with you choosing yourself. And I'm not okay with never seeing you-- my best friend-- ever again.
BONNIE: This hurts me. This hurts... this hurts me...
BONNIE: Hmm. And as you desiccate, and as you feel the pangs of hunger as the blood drains from your body, that's what I want you to remember. That you hurt me.
DAMON: Bon... listen to me...
BONNIE: No. No. You don't get to say goodbye.
STEFAN: Damon. Wake up. I need you! Wake the hell up!
STEFAN: We gotta go.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: She's back. And the scar, it opened up this morning. It's burning.
DAMON: She's not gonna stop until you're dead.
STEFAN: 
TYLER: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
BONNIE: ...How one stupid decision can turn your life into something that you don't recognize.
THERAPIST: Thank you, Bonnie.
ALARIC: Damon.
DAMON: When's the last time you talked to your fiancée?
ALARIC: What the hell do you want?
DAMON: Stefan's being hunted again, and it's only a matter of time before Caroline's the bait to lure him out.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: I'll be back before you know it.
DAMON: Twenty-three minutes. That's just enough time for me to get in, take out Little Miss Stabby-Pants--
ALARIC: Oh, turn, turn, turn!
DAMON: Oh, that's not good.
LILY: You've been poisoned with werewolf toxin.
MATT: Get up.
CAROLINE: 
MATT: All right, I did it. He's out. Now, I never see you again, right?
RAYNA: Have a nice life.
RAYNA: Ahhh. I don't know about you, but... I'm exhausted. I feel like there should be champagne or something.
STEFAN: 
RAYNA: I'm totally not taking credit, by the way. I mean... you came to me. You were safe, in the wind. You played it smart. Then, you got dumb on me. What happened?
RAYNA: I mean, okay, we know what happened. I took someone that you love. Damon... and Caroline. Guess that makes two people. Just out of curiosity, which one of them brought you here? Her, or him?
RAYNA: Fine. Keep your secrets. You'll need something to keep you company in Hell.
RAYNA: Or... there is a Plan B. But, I know how you feel about making choices.
STEFAN: 
RAYNA: Yes. Because, believe it or not, I don't actually want to kill you, Stefan.
STEFAN: 
RAYNA: Just take my word for it. I know you don't deserve that mark, but somebody else does. What if I were to tell you there's a way for me to transfer it to someone a little more deserving? It should have been Damon all along. You know this as well as I do.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Except it wasn't her idea.
DAMON: It was mine.
