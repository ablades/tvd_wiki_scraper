Stefan: We're gonna lose her, Damon.
Damon: She needs time. It's only been a couple days.
Stefan: Her humanity's off. She's basically numb to everything that makes her who she is.
Damon: 
Stefan: She burned down her family home with her brother's dead body still inside.
Damon: Saves us the trouble of having to do it ourselves. I call that a win.
Damon: Worst case scenario: I'll invoke the sire bond and tell her to turn it back on.
Stefan: No, her brother just died. If you force all that grief on her at once, it's going to overwhelm her. We need to give her a reason to want to turn it on.
Damon: Fine, we'll show her a good time.
Damon: I know it's controversial, Stefan, but people actually like to have fun.
Stefan: You really think that's gonna work?
Damon: There's only one way to find out.
Woman: 
Elena: 
Woman: I have a blanket in my car. Try not to move. I'll call for help.
Woman: What are you doing?
Damon: 
Damon: 
Elena: This is the first person I've seen in days whose body isn't laced with vervain and I'm hungry.
Damon: If you leave a trail of bodies, people are gonna start asking questions.
Elena: I don't care.
Damon: I can't believe you're making me say this. Hey, 
Elena: 
Klaus: 
Hayley: 
Klaus: Well, you did say it was urgent.
Klaus: Oh, don't worry about him, love. He'll never make it through tomorrow night.
Hayley: What if there are more?
Klaus: You were foolish enough to make a deal with Katerina Petrova. She used you to find the cure and now you're nothing but a loose end. You'll be lucky if she lets you live.
Hayley: 
Klaus: And I will. 
Damon: So that's the plan? You're gonna take her back to school?
Stefan: Well, the fun route didn't exactly pay off, did it?
Damon: I don't know. Got a free meal out of it.
Stefan: Look, do you think I want to go to school and play chaperone? You can't go because you're not a student. Besides, you've got to go look for Katherine. I mean, Elena needs this cure now more than ever.
Caroline: Not that anyone asked me, but I think taking her back to school is a great idea.
Damon: Why are you here?
Caroline: Uh, blame it on your fancy water filters. Your house has the only vervain-free showers in town.
Damon: Oh, yeah. The mayor put vervain in the water supply. 
Caroline: Yeah, my mom says it's about to get worse, so she could use a little help.
Damon: Fine, I'll go after the psychotic doppelg√§nger. Stefan, you wanna go talk to the Sheriff?
Damon: Blondie, take her to school.
Elena: Sounds like fun.
Elena: What? It's nothing you guys haven't seen before.
Elena: And as for the, uh, "going to school" idea...I've got nothing better to do.
Damon: Elena, it would make me very happy if you went to school today. And studied hard-- you know, get involved in whatever activies, and please, for me, no matter what, don't eat anyone. Okay?
Caroline: Hey, Tyler. It's me checking in. Things are just getting back to normal here, sort of. Elena's not quite there, but we're working on it. 
Matt: 
Caroline: Yeah, I called her last night. She's fine. She's just a little drained from, you know, everything.
Matt: Can't really blame her.
Caroline: Yeah.
Elena: I have an idea. 
Caroline: I mean, technically, yeah. I'm captain, but I thought you hated cheerleading.
Elena: I did, but now I think it would be really fun to jump around and toss people up in the air. It's not like the routines are that hard.
Caroline: 
Klaus: Ah, what an unpleasant surprise.
Damon: 
Damon: It's called "Things You Suck At" 
one: Finding Katherine. Ever. Number two: covering up your secret phone conversations with that little backstabber Hayley. 
Klaus: I should help you?
Damon: 
Klaus: After you lot killed my brother and imprisoned me in the Gilbert living room?
Damon: 
Damon: Katherine has the cure. 
Klaus: Can't help you, mate. Hayley's off limits. 
Forbes: The entire supply of blood from the hospital, all the reserves, gone, just vanished.
Stefan: 
Forbes: No, I'm not accusing you, but this town is at a tipping point. Any more unexplained house fires, and things are gonna boil over. 
Stefan: 
Forbes: Good. You need to. Whoever stole that blood put a lot of lives in danger and risks exposing all of you, my daughter included. 
Caroline: The uniform still fits. You look fantastic. 
Elena: Yeah. Should be fun.
Girl: Oh, my god. You guys, I left my makeup bag on the bus.
Caroline: Wow. The competition's bigger than last year.
Caroline: I'm gonna go stretch.
Elena: I like your ribbon.
Girl: 
Elena: I want it.
Girl: 
Caroline: Hey, where were you? We're going on any minute.
Elena: I'm here, aren't I?
Caroline: What's with the ribbon? That's not even our colors.
Caroline: Are you out of your mind?
Elena: 
Caroline: 
Elena: I did, but who cares? I'll do whatever I want.
Stefan: 
Elena: 
Caroline: Remember how Damon sired her to behave? It didn't really work.
Damon: What do you mean, she fed? I specifically told her, No Feeding. The sire bond should make her listen.
Stefan: 
Damon: That's not possible.
Stefan: Think about it. Elena's sire bond stems from her feelings for you, right? With her humanity off, she has no feelings.
Damon: All I wanted was to break that damn bond. You're telling me now this whole time all she had to do was turn it off? What happens if she turns it back on?
Stefan: I don't know, but more importantly, where are you right now?
Damon: I'm at a truck stop in the boonies looking for a dead vampire that might lead to Katherine and the cure. 
Damon: You. I thought you were still vacationing on Numbskull Island.
Rebekah: Well, I was looking for answers, and all I found was your Professor Shane, dead, and with him, anything anyone knows about the cure.
Damon: Guess you won't turn into a real girl after all. 
Rebekah: Oh, I'll get the cure. I just need Katherine, and I'm betting you can help me find her.
Damon: 
Rebekah: 
Damon: 
Klaus: 
Hayley: Most men get their power kick from torture and intimidation. With you, it's drinks and fine dining.
Klaus: 
Hayley: You seriously think I know?
Klaus: You tipped her off as to what we were up to and set her on a course to find the cure. In return, she sent her lackey to snuff you out. Tell me, what did Katerina promise you?
Hayley: I was in New Orleans trying to find information about my real parents. Katherine found me and told me she could help.
Klaus: 
Hayley: 
Klaus: 
Stefan: Hey, we need to talk.
Elena: So talk. You can help me stretch. 
Stefan: 
Elena: Maybe. 
Stefan: I see. You wouldn't happen to know anything about the hospital's missing blood supply, would you?
Elena: 
Stefan: Look, Elena, I know what you're going through. I was having the time of my life when I first turned, too. I didn't start ripping people's heads off until 1912. The next thing I know, I was killing an entire village.
Elena: 
Stefan: Yeah, you are, because I know how deep down you can fall, and I know how difficult it is to climb back out. Come on. You're better than this.
Elena: I don't know. Maybe this is the better version of me.
Caroline: No way. You are not cheering.
Elena: Let's see you try and stop me.
Stefan: Nice move. What do you do for an encore?
Elena: 
Stefan: No. I was impressed. Getting yourself on the cheerleading squad. Plenty of vervain-free victims bussed in for the competition. You played us all really well.
Elena: It wasn't that hard. You want me to be okay so badly that you hear whatever I want you to.
Stefan: Right. Well, you know, the problem with a gymnasium is, too many witnesses. You gotta go somewhere a little more private for some real fun.
Elena: 
Stefan: Oh, I know this little dive bar off the beaten path. 
Elena: 
Stefan: You're forgetting that I had my switch flipped in this town, too. 
Stefan: But first, a bit of vervain, just to take the edge off.
Rebekah: Why exactly would you think a sick vampire would check into a hospital?
Damon: 
Rebekah: Impressive. You're like Sherlock Holmes with brain damage.
Damon: Stefan said the Mystic Falls Hospital had its entire blood bank raided, too.
Rebekah: It looks like our vampire gets around.
Damon: No. The guy's dying of a werewolf bite. He wouldn't have time to steal from both hospitals. This is someone else.
Rebekah: Who?
Damon: That's another problem. But on the plus side, if our guy did by chance come here, he's got nothing, which means he's nearby and he's hungry.
Rebekah: This better not be a wild goose chase.
Damon: I want to find Katherine as much as you do.
Rebekah: Really? Why? I heard your little chat with Stefan. I know Elena's broken the sire bond. So why would you wanna find the cure? You'd just cure her back to loving your brother. I think you're best off leaving it for me.
Hayley: 
Hayley: Hmm...I don't care. 
Hayley: 
Klaus: Painting is a metaphor for control. Every choice is mine-- the canvas, the color. 
Hayley: So this is your thing-- show a girl a few mediocre paintings, whine about your childhood, and I swoon and spill all my dirty secrets?
Klaus: I felt I had many charms, but, uh, regardless, I'm enjoying myself.
Hayley: 
Klaus: Oh, surely not the next century. Only until I kill him.
Hayley: 
guess: you know if you kill him, Caroline will hate you forever.
Klaus: 
Hayley: I don't know. He might've left Caroline for me if I'd used the cure to kill you.
Klaus: 
Hayley: 
Klaus: 
Hayley: Maybe I know one or two. Maybe I'll even tell you.
Elena: 
Stefan: Brought you home before you can cause any more trouble.
Elena: So you're grounding me...because I dropped Caroline on her thick head.
Stefan: No, because you fed on someone...in public.
Elena: 
Stefan: 
Elena: 
Stefan: Sure. When in doubt, manipulate people with sex. 
Elena: 
Elena: But you clearly do. 
Stefan: Because it's my fault that you're like this. I brought this into your life. 
Stefan: Who are you texting?
Elena: Look at you. Your whole world revolves around me. Maybe you're the one that needs to turn it all off.
Stefan: What is that?
Stefan: 
Elena: You were trying to keep me from joining the party, so...I brought the party here. 
Stefan: 
Caroline: I got here as soon as I could. This is insane.
Stefan: Yeah. It won't last. They'll either drink all the booze and get bored, or, ah, Damon'll come home and kill everyone.
Caroline: We can't compel them to leave. The locals are all on vervain from the town water supply.
Stefan: Yep.
Caroline: So what do we do?
Stefan: Pff, I don't know. Enjoy the party, keep Elena from butchering Grove Hills' cheerleading squad. 
Caroline: Great. And where is she?
Stefan: 
Caroline: I almost forgot what that looked like.
Stefan: What? Elena smiling?
Caroline: 
Stefan: 
Caroline: Well, your sober coach is giving you the green light. 
Stefan: 
Caroline: Just take your own advice. Have fun, you know? We deserve a little bit of fun.
Stefan: 
Caroline: 
Rebekah: Well, nobody could ever mistake you for subtle.
Damon: You have to take pride in your work. 
Rebekah: You know, I just don't see how this increases our odds any.
Damon: I've been on the other side of a wolf bite. First you get really sick. Then you get really hungry. Since the sun's gone down, I'm imagining he's gonna be looking for his last supper. I just laid out a 3-course, 115-pound meal for him.
Will: Damon?
Damon: Will?
Will: 
Damon: 
Rebekah: 
Damon: He was too far gone. I put him out of his misery.
Klaus: My sister informs me that your vampire assailant is dead, so you're safe and free to go. Or stay.
Hayley: 
Klaus: Oh, I'm sorry, love, but you'll never convince me to let Tyler go free.
Hayley: Well, then, I guess I'll never get my chance with Tyler any more than you'll get a shot with Caroline.
Hayley: Do you wanna know why I like that painting?
Klaus: 
Hayley: 
Klaus: 
Hayley: You like to be in control. You tell me.
Elena: Look who finally joined the party.
Stefan: Yeah. Why? Are you jealous or something?
Elena: No. That would imply emotions, and we've already established those are useless.
Caroline: Come on, Elena. Just dance with us.
Elena: No. You guys look good together. 
Forbes: Elena. What's going on in here?
Elena: Just some underage drinking and drug use.
Forbes: Where's Stefan?
Elena: He's actually busy flirting with your daughter. But I think he's a good rebound for her because of the whole Tyler thing.
Forbes: I'm shutting this down right now.
Elena: Liz, please. Why don't you just stay and have a drink?
Forbes: Elena, take your hand off me.
Elena: 
Caroline: Mom!
Forbes: I'm fine.
Stefan: Caroline, calm down.
Caroline: 
Caroline: Elena! Where the hell is she?
Stefan: Right where she wants to be. This is completely calculated. She drew all those people to the house, waited for an opportunity to distract us, and now she's free.
Caroline: I can't believe she's doing this. I mean, she hurt my mom, Stefan.
Stefan: All right, listen. You search the woods, I'll check the road. If you see her, don't hesitate. Just snap her neck, got it?
Caroline: 
Stefan: Okay.
Damon: 
Rebekah: What are you hiding? I know you knew that vampire.
Damon: 
Rebekah: You killed him to prevent me from finding Katherine to keep me from getting the cure.
Damon: Do you really want the cure? I mean really? 
Rebekah: And what would that be?
Damon: Life sucks when you're ordinary. And what makes you exactly not like them? You're a vampire. You take that cure, become human, well, you're no one, nothing. Trust me. Losing this cure is the best damn thing that ever happened to you.
Caroline: Elena! Don't make me fight you, Elena! I'm stronger than you, and I don't want to hurt you.
Elena: 
Elena: Not bad. Not technically good, but then again, Alaric didn't train you. You were probably too busy butting into people's business!
Caroline: 
Elena: Are you trying to make me feel bad for hurting your mom? Don't you get it? I don't care. I mean, maybe you should try to turn it all off. Who knows? You might stop whining about how Tyler left you. Added bonus: you won't have to feel guilty about all the dirty thoughts you have about Klaus.
Caroline: 
Elena: Make me.
Elena: 
Elena: 
Damon: 
Stefan: 
Caroline: Hey, Tyler. It's me. You'll never believe the crazy day I've had. Look, I know that you said you wouldn't, but I really wish that you would answer. It'd be great to talk to you.
Stefan: You all right?
Caroline: You mean besides the fact that my best friend tried to kill me?
Stefan: 
Caroline: So how do we get her back? Or what if we can't? Why would she choose to turn her emotions back on? She's an orphan. She just lost her brother. Her life sucks, Stefan. So why would she come back to us?
Stefan: 
Stefan: 
Elena: How much longer am I supposed to sit here?
Damon: Well, I'm not big on goal-setting, but let's just imagine a time when you don't wanna kill your best friend.
Elena: Are you judging me? 
Damon: 
Elena: Don't. 
Damon: You don't want to be like this.
Elena: Then how should I be? Should I go back to being the scared little girl who couldn't admit what she wants? Is that how you'd prefer me to go back to being, or-- Look. For the longest time, you wanted to be with me, but you were scared that I'd find out how awful you are. But it doesn't matter anymore because I don't care. 
Caroline: Matt?
Matt: 
Caroline: Matt, why can't I get inside?
Matt: 
Caroline: Matt, what's going on?
Matt: Tyler sent me this package in the mail. 
Tyler: (Voiceover.) Dear Care, I miss you more than I can put into words, but I know as long as Klaus is alive, I can't come home. He won't stop trying to kill me, and you won't stop trying to protect me. Which means the only way to make sure you're safe is for me to go and never come back. I left Matt the deed to the house. It will protect you in ways I can't anymore. I will always love you.
Caroline: He's not coming back.
Klaus: 
Hayley: What?
Klaus: That mark. I've seen it before.
Hayley: Yeah. It's a birthmark. People have those.
Klaus: In my considerable lifetime, I've only seen that mark on a handful of others, all from the same bloodline-- a werewolf clan that once thrived throughout much of what we now call Louisiana.
Hayley: Don't lie to me-- not about this.
Klaus: I wouldn't dare. Matters of family are sacred.
Hayley: Tell me.
Stefan: Sheriff Forbes. Everything okay?
Forbes: 
Damon: Hey.
Stefan: Where the hell are you?
Damon: Out for a drive. I needed some space. It's not me, it's you.
Stefan: Well, we got a little problem. You said blood was stolen from Grove Hills Hospital? The sheriff said there's been reports of six other blood bank thefts all within 30 miles of Mystic Falls. Somebody's stockpiling blood. It wasn't Elena, and it's not us.
Damon: Okay, so...
Stefan: I think Silas followed us back from that island. He hasn't fed in 2000 years, so he would need to gorge on blood. It explains the thefts.
Damon: You know, I'm really not in the mood to scooby-doo our way through the case of the stolen blood supply, so why don't you hold the fort down until I get back, and I'll be in touch, brother.
Elena: He's gonna hate you for that.
Damon: Yeah, well, emotions are overrated.
Elena: So where are we going?
Damon:
