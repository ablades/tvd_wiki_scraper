Matt: Caroline, let me help!
Caroline: Get back, I got it!
Matt: Caroline, the door's not going to hold.
Matt: Come on!
Caroline: Tyler, please!
Caroline: Matt! No, hey, no! It's Tyler!
Matt: It's trying to kill us!
Caroline: Wait!
Caroline: He's wounded.
Matt: Caroline, stay back.
Caroline: We can go around him.
Matt: Are you nuts?
Caroline: You're not going to shoot him again, okay? Okay. Matt, take my hand.
Matt: I got it.
Caroline: 
Katherine: So that's what a werewolf bite looks like.
Damon: Yep.
Katherine: It's not that bad.
Damon: Will be.
Katherine: So that's it? You're just...going to die?
Damon: Well, that depends. You know anything about a cure?
Damon: Me, either.
Katherine: 145 years and no last good-bye?
Damon: You don't get a good-bye.
Katherine: No. Don't leave mad.
Damon: Us ending up on good terms isn't exactly on my bucket list, Katherine.
Katherine: Klaus made me call Jenna to lure her out. There was nothing that I could do. I didn't have a choice.
Damon: That's why I gave you the vervain. So you had a choice.
Katherine: It was her or me. I chose her.
Damon: I helped you. You owed me. Now when Klaus dies, you're going to walk out of here without a scratch and Elena's aunt dies. Somehow you're the only one that wins. How'd that happen?
Katherine: I didn't let love get in the way.
Damon: Enjoy an eternity alone, Katherine.
Katherine: What are you going to do?
Damon: 
Katherine: He won't take you. He saw your bite, he said that your blood is impure. I'm sorry, Damon. But Jenna's dead, there's nothing you can do about it.
Jenna: Oh, my head. What's wrong with me?
Elena: Do you remember what happened?
Jenna: You called me. You were so scared. Oh, ah, I should have realized that it wasn't you. The second I walked out of the house, someone grabbed me. A vampire.
Elena: Klaus. It was Klaus.
Jenna: He made me drink his blood. And I don't...I don't remember anything after that. 
Elena: We're at the quarry. He brought us here.
Jenna: Why don't I remember anything?
Elena: Jenna, do you remember...When I told you how someone becomes a vampire?
Jenna: Yeah, if you die with vampire blood in your system, it's...
Elena: Jenna, listen to me. Listen to me; everything's going to be okay. I'm going to get you out of here.
Jenna: I'm a vampire?
Greta: And I bet you're hungry.
Greta: Don't bother trying to get through. I spelled the circle. You're trapped. No matter what you do.
Elena: Greta...Please, just- just let her go.
Greta: Klaus chose her.
Elena: No.
Greta: Drink it.
Elena: Jenna, don't!
Jenna: I can't.
Elena: Let her go. Hey!
Elena: No! No.
Greta: That's enough.
Elena: Jenna. It's going to be okay.
Elena: Look at me. Hey, look at me.
Elena: It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
Jeremy: This is useless. All these grimoires. There has to be something in here to keep Elena from becoming a vampire.
Bonnie: And we'll keep looking. Until the last minute.
Elijah: The sacrifice is completed in stages as the full moon sets. First the werewolf is killed, then the vampire. Finally the doppelgänger. Once Elena dies, the curse will be broken. Klaus will become hybrid.
Alaric: So when do we attack?
Elijah: Elena's death will activate his dormant werewolf side. He'll be vulnerable during the transformation. That's when Bonnie comes in.
Stefan: And you're sure Bonnie will survive this?
Elijah: If she can deliver him to the brink of death, I'll finish the job myself.
Stefan: Damon.
Damon: You're not going to like what I'm about to say.
Stefan: Cut to the chase. Is the sacrifice happening or not?
Damon: It's happening. I tried to stop it, but it got...complicated.
Stefan: We're sticking with the original plan. We're meeting Bonnie right now.
Damon: He's got Jenna, Stefan.
Stefan: What?
Damon: He got Kath to lure her out of the house.
Alaric: What is it? What's wrong?
Damon: He's going to use her as the vampire in the ritual.
Stefan: Oh, my god.
Elena: How are you feeling?
Jenna: I feel like myself...Only not. Everything is brighter. The fire's hotter. Part of me is terrified, but there's another part of me that doesn't want to feel anything.
Elena: Vampires can turn off the part that's human. That's the part that hurts.
Jenna: 
Elena: No! Jenna, I'm not going to let that happen. I don't care what I have to do.
Jenna: Who's that?
Elena: That must be the werewolf.
Jules: What's happening to me?
Greta: I cast a spell to slow down your transformation. Your insides are trying to tear themselves free.
Elena: Greta, witches are supposed to maintain the balance in nature. It's your duty to them to keep this curse sealed.
Greta: My duty is to Klaus! The new order.
Klaus: Glad to know I still have a dance partner.
Klaus: Hello, my lovelies. Are we ready?
Caroline: Come on. Get in here!
Caroline: Do you see anything?
Matt: We're not safe here. If that thing wants in, it's getting in.
Caroline: How did you even know what I was? I compelled you to forget!
Matt: I was on vervain. I faked forgetting so I could spy on you. It was your mom's idea.
Caroline: Wait, my mom knows?! Oh my God! You told her. Well, what'd she say?
Matt: Your mom hates vampires. She grew up hating vampires. She'll probably always hate vampires.
Caroline: Well, what about you?
Matt: What about me?
Caroline: Where does this leave us?
Matt: Stuck in this house. Trying not to get mauled to death by our friend.
Damon: 
Damon: Great. I was just thinking about getting a bite to eat.
John: Elena hasn't returned any of my calls for days. I need to see her.
Damon: Well, you're a day late and a daughter short, John.
John: What are you talking about?
Damon: Klaus has her. Sacrifice goes down tonight.
John: How could you let that happen? You were supposed to keep her safe. Wasn't that the sum total of your plan? To keep her safe?
Damon: She is safe. I fed her my blood.
John: You what?!
Damon: When Klaus kills Elena in the sacrifice, she will come back to life. Granted, as the thing you hate most in the world, but no one really cares what you think.
Damon: You do not want to mess with me right now.
John: You ruined her life. You know that, right?
Damon: I know, John. I took her choice, destroyed her future. Trust me, I get it. It actually gets worse.
John: How could it possibly get any worse?
Klaus: I've got the moonstone. I spent 500 years looking for this. I hate to part with it.
Greta: The moon has passed its apex. Remember everything you need to do?
Klaus: I remember.
Jules: Everything I did...I was just trying to help Tyler.
Elena: Are you Jules?
Jules: I didn't want him to be alone!
Klaus: Shall we?
Bonnie: Which one are you reading?
Jeremy: Emily Bennett's, there's a section on spells she did for my ancestor, Johnathan Gilbert.
Bonnie: Yeah, I think she had a thing for him.
Jeremy: There's something on a resuscitative spell she was working on.
Bonnie: I saw that, too. She just didn't explain what it did, exactly.
Jeremy: Well, maybe Johnathan wrote about it in his journals. You know, I can have Stefan bring them.
Bonnie: Someone's here.
Jeremy: Hey, what are you doing here?
Alaric: Elijah and Stefan are upstairs. 
Bonnie: Sure, yeah. Of course.
Jeremy: What's the matter?
Alaric: Jeremy...Something's happened to Jenna.
Bonnie: Why did he take Jenna?
Elijah: A punishment for meddling.
Stefan: Klaus was going to use Tyler and Caroline. But Damon rescued them.
Bonnie: Then we need to go. Now. Before Jenna's been sacrificed. I can kill Klaus myself.
Stefan: Bonnie...If you use that much power, you'll be dead. We've already been through this. It's not an option.
Bonnie: Neither is letting Jenna die.
Elijah: Well, Stefan would agree with you.
Stefan: We're going to offer another vampire. One that he'll want more. Me.
Klaus: Does that mean it's working?
Greta: It's working.
Jenna: The day that the lawyers called to tell me that I was going to become your guardian, you know what my first thought was? 
Elena: Jenna, there was no one else who could have gotten me and Jeremy through all of that.
Jenna: It's just the thought that I almost passed up taking care of you.
Elena: But you didn't. 
Jenna: Look around, Elena. I failed you.
Elena: No. You didn't. I failed you. I'm so sorry. Listen. Being a vampire, it intensifies your guilt. But it also makes you stronger and faster. You can fight back. I'm gonna get through this. I'll be okay. I need you to believe that. Promise me, when you get the chance...
Jenna: 
Matt: You don't think I killed him, do you?
Caroline: No. No. It takes a lot more than wooden bullets to kill a werewolf. He's still out there somewhere. Do you think my mom wants to kill me?
Matt: I don't think your mom knows what to do with you.
Caroline: Yeah, well, I don't really know what to do with me, either.
Matt: What is it?
Caroline: Wait.
Caroline: Don't. Don't shoot.
Matt: What the hell are you doing?
Caroline: 
Matt: What?
Caroline: Your jacket, take it off.
Caroline: Hey.
Tyler: 
Caroline: Hey. It's okay. It's okay.
Elijah: Bonnie did the locator spell. They're at Steven's Quarry.
Stefan: I'll head over there first and you'll follow with Bonnie when it's time.
Elijah: Just as the moon hits its final phase. She's to stay hidden until then. He cannot know that she's alive.
Elijah: You're very honorable.
Stefan: Are you? Because this whole plan is, um, it's contingent upon your honor, Elijah.
Elijah: I won't fail you.
Stefan: Klaus is your brother. I know I've wanted to kill my brother a thousand times. I've never been able to.
Elijah: Well, Klaus was not my only brother. I had siblings; parents. I had a family. Over the centuries, Klaus hunted them down one by one and he took them from me. He scattered them across the seas where their bodies could not be found.
Stefan: You want revenge.
Elijah: Sometimes there's honor in revenge, Stefan. I won't fail you.
Stefan: Please end this.
John: I brought the Gilbert journals. I think I know the spell you're talking about.
Bonnie: Where's Damon?
John: Upstairs. Alaric wanted to talk to him.
Damon: He did what?!
Alaric: He wasn't going to let Jenna die.
Damon: 
Alaric: Except for Bonnie.
Damon: God, Stefan, damn it!
Alaric: Hey, are you okay?
Damon: I'm fine. 
Klaus: Hello, Jenna.
Elena: Let her go. I understand that I have to die, but she doesn't!
Klaus: Careful.
Jenna: Elena, don't.
Elena: No, Jenna! We can't leave Jeremy without a family. 
Klaus: Well, well.
Klaus: I don't recall you being on the guest list.
Stefan: I'm here to talk.
Klaus: Very well, then.
Klaus: What can I do for you, Mr. Salvatore?
Bonnie: We found something in the Gilbert journals.
John: Johnathan journaled the story of a mother who called on Emily's services. The woman's baby was sick; dying. Emily cast a spell that would bind the woman's life force with her child.
Damon: Skip to the save Elena part.
John: Well, the child died, but the mother's life force flowed through her, restoring her to life.
Jeremy: We already know Elena's going to come back to life. But she'll be a vampire.
John: Not if her soul remains intact.
Damon: 
John: I refuse to let Elena become the thing I've spent my life protecting her against. And you can call that God or mystical energy, whatever you want, but yes...I'm putting my faith in it.
Jenna: What's going on?
Elena: I-I don't know. 
Stefan: You don't need to kill Jenna. I'll take her place.
Klaus: Oh, I don't know. I rather appreciate the symmetry of three women 
Elena: 
Jenna: I can't-I can't make it out.
Elena: You can do this. Just relax. Focus.
Stefan: 
Jenna: I can hear him. I hear Stefan.
Elena: What are they saying?
Klaus: You're quite the hero, aren't you? I've heard that about you.
Stefan: Just make the trade. Me for Jenna.
Jenna: Oh, my god.
Elena: What is it?
Jenna: He wants to take my place.
Matt: How's Tyler doing?
Caroline: Sleeping. He should be better by morning. He just...He needs some rest.
Matt: Good. 
Caroline: 
Matt: You know, these last few days with you have been so great, and fun.
Matt: And so Caroline. I-I thought that I might be able to get past this whole vampire thing.
Caroline: But you can. Matt...
Matt: I don't - I don't know if I can, Caroline.
Caroline: Matt!
Matt: I get it. This is your life now. You know what my life is, Care? My life is an absentee mom. And a bunch of bills to pay, and school, and a job, and it - and it sucks sometimes. But it's my life. And...I think that I just want to live it without all of this.
Damon: Come on, Bonnie, we got a hybrid to kill.
Bonnie: It's done.
Damon: That's it? Let's go.
Bonnie: I'll be back soon.
Jeremy: Wait, what do you mean? No, I'm coming. I need to be there. I need to make sure you guys are okay.
Bonnie: And who's going to make sure you're okay?
Jeremy: I've got my own ring. Look, I'm not taking no for an answer.
John: Easy, easy. 
Elijah: It's time.
Alaric: All right. I got the weapons in the car.
Elijah: Bonnie's the only weapon we need.
Alaric: Bonnie! What is this?
Bonnie: I can't put anyone else at risk.
Alaric: I can't stay here with Jenna out there!
Bonnie: I'm sorry.
Alaric: You can't do this! Damon?
Damon: Sorry, buddy. She's right.
Alaric: No! You can't do this. Bonnie! Bonnie!
Jenna: Elena...
Elena: I have to do something. This can't happen. None of it.
Klaus: Quite the predicament. You know, it's funny, all this talk about preserving family, and here's Stefan, granting your wish.
Elena: 
Stefan: It's okay.
Klaus: Well. 
Elena: No.
Klaus: Oh, don't worry. There's actually no choice.
Elena: No! Stefan! No!
Klaus: I have other plans for your boyfriend. I want him alive. But for now...
Klaus: Whenever you're ready, Greta.
Elena: No.
Klaus: Your turn.
Elena: No, Jenna, no!
Jenna: It's alright, Elena. I know what I have to do.
Elena: Jenna, no!
Elena: Just turn it off. Jenna. Turn it off. You won't be scared anymore.
Elena: No! Jenna! No! Jenna!
Stefan: No.
Stefan: I'm so sorry.
Elena: 
Stefan: 
Klaus: It's time.
Klaus: Thank you, Elena.
Elena: Go to hell.
Klaus: I can feel it. It's happening.
Klaus: Yes, yes!
Bonnie: Phasmatos Infero Eseri Gratas, Disasustos Vom, Mas Pro Je Ta Sue Te. Victamas Veras. Phasmatos Tribum, Niha Sue Exilum, Disasustos Vom, Mas Pro Je Ta Sue Te. Levam, Mina Sue Te, Disasustos Vom, Mas Pro Je Ta Sue Te. Phasmatos Veras. Fes Matos Tribum, Mas Pro Tes Unum. Victas Ex Melam, Phasmatos Vanem. Mas Pro Je Ta Sue Te.
Klaus: No! You were dead!
Stefan: Elena.
Stefan: I need you to get her out of here!
Damon: What about you?
Stefan: I'm not leaving until he's dead. Go!
Klaus: Elijah?
Elijah: Hello, brother.
Elijah: In the name of our family, Niklaus...
Klaus: I didn't bury them at sea!
Elijah: What?
Klaus: Their bodies are safe. If you kill me, you'll never find them.
Stefan: Elijah! Don't listen to him.
Klaus: Elijah. I can take you to them. I give you my word...brother.
Bonnie: Do it and I'll take you both out.
Elijah: You'll die.
Bonnie: I don't care.
Elijah: I'm sorry.
Stefan: No!
Bonnie: No.
Alaric: 
Jeremy: 
John: I did.
Jeremy: So you understand what happened to the child's mother after the baby was brought back to life?
John: She saved her daughter. She found peace.
Jeremy: John...
John: I need you to give this to Elena for me. And also this.
Alaric: Oh, hey, what's going on?
John: 
Alaric: I think they're here!
Damon: If you come back as a vampire, I'll stake you myself. So don't.
Damon: Because I can't stand the idea of you hating me forever.
Jeremy: How is she?
Damon: I don't know yet.
Alaric: What about Jenna?
Alaric: No.
Damon: I'm sorry, Jeremy.
Damon: Elena!
Elena: What happened?
Damon: How do you feel?
Elena: I feel fine.
Caroline: Hey.
Caroline: Ooh, yeah, you got shot. But it's healing.
Tyler: You were right. I shouldn't have come home.
Caroline: No, you just...should have never left. And you shouldn't leave again.
Tyler: You're kidding, right? This is the second time I've tried to kill you.
Caroline: Well, no friendship is perfect.
Caroline: Matt broke up with me.
Tyler: I'm sorry.
Caroline: Yeah, well, you know, instead of just bailing on me again, you could just say..."Thank you, Caroline, for taking care of me. And I'm sorry that I tried to chow down on you again."
Tyler: Hey. Hey. Come here.
Tyler: Oh, easy.
Tyler: Thank you, Caroline. For taking care of me.
Caroline: You're welcome.
Stefan: We all set?
Damon: Yeah. Plenty of room with the Gilbert family plot and I compelled two of the grave diggers to do the dirty work. How's she doing?
Stefan: She lost the only parents she had. She's in shock.
Elena: I'm almost ready.
Jeremy: Yeah, take your time.
Jeremy: John wanted me to give you this. 
Elena: Jeremy...
Elena: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that you've lost so many people.
Jeremy: I still have you.
John: "Elena...it's no easy task being an ordinary parent to an extraordinary child. I failed in that task."
John: "And because of my prejudices, I failed you. I'm haunted by how things might have played out differently. If I'd been more willing to hear your side of things."
John: "For me, it's the end. For you, a chance to grow old and someday do better with your own child than I did with mine. It's for that child that I give you my ring."
John: "I don't ask for your forgiveness or for you to forget. I ask only that you believe this. Whether you are now reading this as a human or as a vampire, I love you all the same as I've always loved you, and always will. John. "
Stefan: We're going to head back to the house.
Damon: I think I'll skip the coffee and tea cakes.
Stefan: Damon, she needs us right now. All of us.
Damon: And then what's the plan, Stefan? The curse is broken. How does one go about killing an all-powerful wolf vamp and his two-faced older brother?
Stefan: I have no idea.
Damon: We need to get an idea. Fast.
Stefan: I'm not going to let Elena lose anybody else.
Damon: I wouldn't make any promises, brother.
Stefan: What's that supposed to mean?
Damon: Tyler Lockwood bit me.
Damon: 
Stefan: We'll find something. A cure.
Damon: There's no cure, Stefan.
Stefan: We kept Elena human, right? We found the way when there was no way. Hey.
Stefan: I will do this.
Damon: You want to do something for me? Keep this from Elena. Last thing she needs is another grave to mourn.
