Connor: Don't bother. It's a paralytic.
Damon: Good day for a midlife crisis. 164 years, I'd say you're due.
Stefan: 
Damon: 
Stefan: 
Damon: That hunter jacked Tyler Lockwood of his werewolf venom last night, so basically, he's got vampire poison in a bottle. And I'm gonna find him, and I'm gonna eat him.
Stefan: 
Damon: I don't want your help. I just want to kill this guy and get the hell out of town. Wasn't that the deal? Whoever Elena doesn't choose leaves?
Stefan: That was before she turned.
Damon: And I stayed to help. If I take you punching me as the first clue, I'm not wanted here anymore.
Stefan: 
Damon: No, brother, dramatic would be leaving before I kill this hunter.
Matt: 
Elena: Thank you for doing this. I can't keep anything else down.
Matt: It's okay. I kind of owe you my life, remember?
Elena: Yeah, but I didn't make Stefan save your life so that I could turn you into a human blood bag.
Matt: Elena, please, just...
Matt: Was that enough?
Elena: 
Elena: Thank you.
Matt: So, you really think school is the best place for you right now?
Elena: The vampire hunter knows that Damon's a vampire and that I know Damon. Hiding at home would be more suspicious. Besides, I want to be here. It's my senior year. I survived this long, there's no way I'm bailing before graduation.
Elena: 
Matt: Tyler got shot in front of half the town. Everyone's a little freaked.
Elena: If only they knew the real story.
Tyler: Who the hell are you two?
Carol: Tyler, it's okay. They're here for your protection.
Tyler: 
Klaus: Not exactly.
Tyler: 
Klaus: I was halfway to Chicago when I heard you were attacked. I had hoped to leave Mystic Falls for good, but duty calls.
Tyler: Nice to know you care.
Klaus: I don't. I should have killed you for the little stunt you and your friends pulled. Stopping my heart, leaving me in a coffin to rot.
Tyler: Yeah, well you used my body as an escape hatch, then kissed my girlfriend. So, maybe we're even.
Klaus: Not even close. But, you hybrids are a dying breed. I can't make more of you, and I won't have anyone taking liberties with the ones I have left.
Klaus: Consider them your new bodyguards.
Stefan: It's the first time we've been back in Alaric's classroom...
Elena: First period, and I'm ready to bawl my eyes out.
Rebekah: Morning, everyone.
Student: Morning, Bekah.
Elena: 
Rebekah: So, I'm throwing a little anti-curfew party at my new house. Starts at fifth period and goes 'til whenever. Spread the word.
Rebekah: You're welcome to join, Elena, if you'd like to bury the hatchet.
Elena: It's a pretty enormous hatchet.
Rebekah: 
Elena: 
Rebekah: He didn't kick me out, I left.
Elena: So, you left the only person on earth that actually likes you?
Rebekah: Well, your boyfriend liked me once. 
Stefan: Why are you still in town, Rebekah? Don't you have anywhere else to go?
Rebekah: Well, history's my favorite class. Actually, where is Mr. Saltzman...?
Rebekah: 
Stefan: Just breathe, just breathe. You haven't felt this kind of rage before.
Elena: I hate her.
Elena: I didn't think I was capable of hate, but I hate her, and I hate that I hate her.
Elena: That's the hunter.
Stefan: What the hell is he doing here?
Elena: Jeremy. No.
Stefan: No, no, no. Hey, hey, let me get this. 
Heather: There you are. Rebekah sent me to see if you were okay.
Elena: 
Heather: I'm not.
Rebekah: What's wrong, Elena? Getting hungry?
Elena: 
Rebekah: But she's so delicious.
Elena: You shouldn't be here. This is my school. It's my life. And I'm not gonna let you ruin it!
Rebekah: It's my school now. My life. Maybe you're the one who shouldn't be here. And I couldn't help but overhear that there's a vampire hunter roaming the hallways.
Rebekah: How inconvenient for you.
Rebekah: See you in gym. I think it's dodgeball day.
Jeremy: Do you mind telling me who you are and why I'm here? I mean, I'm happy to miss Bio but...
Connor: I looked into your family's history. You and your sister have been through quite a lot.
Jeremy: 
Connor: Because you saw this.
Jeremy: It's a tattoo, big deal.
Connor: I call this a Hunter's mark. As in vampire hunter.
Jeremy: 
Connor: Jeremy. I know your family's history in this town, so you playing dumb just makes you look dumb.
Jeremy: Why the show and tell? I don't even know you.
Connor: Because it's invisible to anyone but another hunter or a potential hunter. Find me a vampire, I'll train you, teach you how to do what I do. I'm on Hudson off Route 13. Don't show up unless you find one.
Jeremy: Well, how am I supposed to do that?
Connor: Why don't you start by asking your friend with the bandage on his neck?
Damon: Um...Yeah.
Caroline: 
Elena: I don't want to go home. I want to take the white oak stake and kill her. That's how mad I am. She made me murderous!
Stefan: How about we just leave the murdering to Damon?
Elena: And-and then do what? Ignore her to death?
Stefan: 
Elena: Yeah. Okay, fine.
Elena: Then, we'll go to her party and show her that she can't intimidate me. I just have to go home and change first.
Caroline: Does she seem a little off-balance to you?
Stefan: Yeah, she's channeling all her emotions into rage. It makes her feel like she has purpose. I used to do that too when I was...you know.
Caroline: Ripper-you?
Stefan: Yeah. She needs to come to terms with it, confront it, let it in, before she can let it go.
Caroline: 
Caroline: You should write a book. Go on The View.
Stefan: Hm.
Hayley: So, this is where you've been hiding, huh?
Tyler: 
Hayley: Hey, Lockwolf!
Hayley: Ass! I thought Klaus killed you.
Tyler: I should have called.
Hayley: From your trailer park in Florida? You liar!
Hayley: You're totally loaded!
Hayley: I chained you up all over the Appalachians. I talked you through every turn. I helped you break the sire bond. You could have told me your real story.
Tyler: I didn't want anybody to follow me back.
Tyler: Werewolves weren't safe around Klaus, and you shouldn't be here, either. His hybrids are all over this house, and so is he.
Hayley: I know. One of his hybrids is with a pack I ran with. He called me and told me that he was coming to protect a guy named Tyler, and I thought, tsk, what are the chances?
Hayley: Well, the least you could do is pour me some fancy, rich people scotch.
Tyler: Sure! Absolutely.
Meredith: Why were you being so cryptic?
Damon: Come in. Close the door.
Meredith: 
Damon: Okay. It's a kitten. It's an adorable, exploding kitten.
Meredith: 
Damon: Because I'm proud, and stubborn, and...oh, look! You're already here.
Damon: Come on, you're not gonna get hurt. All I need you to do is be doctorly and cut out the arrow. I'd do it myself, but if I move...
Meredith: 
Meredith: Okay.
Meredith: Okay.
Damon: So, how well did you know Pastor Young?
Meredith: He was a patient of mine. He was always a nice guy.
Damon: Nice, crazy guy. He wrote a letter about sacrifice and war brewing in Mystic Falls.
Meredith: What does he mean, "a greater evil is coming"? 
Damon: 
Meredith: How did you get stuck on hunter duty?
Damon: 
Meredith: 
Damon: 
Meredith: You're strung up to a bomb while Stefan plays vampire with the girl who broke your heart. But, you're doing a very good job of acting like it doesn't suck.
Meredith: Okay, I think that should be good.
Rebekah: Hey, Matt.
Rebekah: So, I'm having a little party. You should ditch last period and come.
Rebekah: Look, I know you're still angry I ran you off the bridge, but you have to understand-- Alaric killed my brother. He was trying to kill me. I had to do something to stop him. I never wanted to hurt you.
Connor: 
Connor: Kinky girlfriend. Who are you letting feed on you?
Matt: I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know where I got that.
Connor: Are you sure about that?
Connor: Tell me which one of your high school friends is a bloodsucker.
Matt: 
Connor: Thank you. And when you wake up, she'll be long gone.
Damon: Hope you plan on cleaning this up.
Elena: I need bourbon to get through Rebekah's party. Yours is better than Stefan's.
Damon: Top drawer in the dresser.
Elena: 
Elena: You keep alcohol in your underwear drawer?
Damon: No.
Damon: But, you weren't looking for alcohol, were you? 
Elena: What happened to you?
Damon: Hunter mishap.
Elena: 
Damon: Yep. Jeremy told me.
Elena: Why were you talking to Jeremy?
Damon: Don't worry about it.
Elena: Damon, don't bring him into this.
Damon: Cherish the thought that he might actually be useful, Elena.
Damon: You staying for the show or...?
Elena: 
Connor: You got a vampire for me?
Jeremy: No, but I know where you can find one. There's a doctor, Meredith Fell. She uses vampire blood in surgery. I think she has a deal with one, her blood for his.
Connor: 
Jeremy: Is that where we're going?
Connor: Nah, we're going to the hospital. If any of those people are drinking at that high school party, I've got it covered. They'll be dead by sundown.
Stefan: Wow, we didn't have to be invited in. I wonder who used to live here.
Elena: Or who died here.
Stefan: You're fixating.
Elena: No, I'm just quietly hating.
Stefan: This is mine now.
Stefan: Thank you.
Stefan: Why don't you have a drink? It'll help you let go.
Elena: April's here. I'm gonna go say hi.
Stefan: And I am going to find something a little stronger than beer.
Elena: 
Caroline: I ditched Rebekah's ditching party.
Caroline: 
Tyler: Hybrids. I'm on house arrest.
Caroline: Says who? Your mom? 
Tyler: Not my mom, Caroline.
Caroline: 
Klaus: You're a new face.
Hayley: And I take it from your accent you're an old one. Klaus.
Klaus: 
Hayley: 
Klaus: So, you're a friend of Tyler's? That's strange, he's never mentioned you.
Tyler: You should go to the party. I'll be fine here.
Caroline: But, I'd rather hang with you.
Tyler: Trust me, I am no fun right now.
Klaus: And I think I know why.
Elena: Hey.
April: Elena! Thank God, I know someone.
Elena: I'm glad you came. 
April: 
Elena: And now I'm giving you beer. Sounds about right.
April: Mmm, if my dad could see me now.
Elena: How are you doing with everything?
April: I'm trudging through my denial phase. Dreaming up conspiracy theories.
April: My first weekend home from boarding school, my dad smelled cigarette smoke on my clothes before I even walked in the door. He would have noticed a gas leak in the house.
Elena: So, you-you don't think that it was an accident?
April: I know there's no investigation, that everyone's calling it an accident. But, the shooting at the church? It just feels like...
Rebekah: Like something wicked this way comes? I know, right? It's like this town's cursed or something.
Elena: 
April: 
Rebekah: Did I forget to uninvite you?
Elena: Did you blow up her dad's house to get revenge on the Council?
Rebekah: 
Elena: My ring!
Elena: Give it back!
Rebekah: Get it yourself.
Elena: No!
Stefan: Damon give that to you?
Elena: Yes. Reluctantly. 
Stefan: 
happen: it'll feel really good for about ten seconds, and then after that, tens of thousands of vampires all over the world will start to die. Every vampire she ever turned will die. See, rage is a really powerful feeling. But guilt? Take it from me-- it'll destroy you. So, you can either go after her, or you can get on the back of my motorcycle and we can get the hell out of here.
Rebekah: 
Elena: No. Not just yet.
Elena: I never got a drink.
Elena: 
Rebekah: 
Klaus: 
Tyler: 
Klaus: Oh, she had to run, but don't worry, I had her take the back door so Caroline wouldn't see.
Tyler: Whatever you think you know...
Klaus: I don't know anything, but I've put together a pretty convincing picture. 
Klaus: You went off to the Appalachians to break my sire-bond. There, you met a pack of werewolves, begged them for help. Among them was a girl. She was gorgeous, with the same animal instincts as you. Emotions ran high, inhibitions ran low--
Tyler: 
Klaus: 
Tyler: I said stop!
Klaus: 
Klaus: Hello, Damon.
Damon: 
Klaus: Tyler's otherwise occupied, making big decisions about honesty and whatnot. Is there anything I can do?
Damon: I'm going after the vampire hunter, so if he'd like to join...?
Klaus: He wouldn't. I, however...
Jeremy: That's her.
Connor: Stay here.
Connor: Is a hospital really the best place for a germaphobe?
Damon: Did I say that I was a germaphobe? Pft, sorry, I meant vampire.
Damon: Stings, doesn't it?
Klaus: Hello, mate.
Elena: No!
Stefan: 
Elena: Stefan. What's wrong with me?
Stefan: 
Elena: Oh my God.
Matt: You don't look so hot.
Rebekah: Whatever it is, it's not the white oak stake, so it can't kill me.
Rebekah: I'm surprised you came to my party.
Matt: Well, I thought about it. You explained why you ran me off the bridge, so the least I could do is explain how I feel. The truth is Rebekah, I think you're amazing.
Matt: You've had a thousand years to learn, to grow, and to start fresh. And somehow you've managed to throw it all away. Now you're alone. You're compelling your friends. Your brother hates you. You whine about not finding love. The reason you don't find love is because you don't deserve it.
Damon: Keep it up, buddy. We'll be scraping you off the ceiling.
Connor: You two are gonna kill me anyway.
Klaus: Well, let's not be too hasty. I feel like we're just getting to know each other!
Damon: Let's start with the basics. Where are you from? What do you know? Maybe you can cue me in on this "greater evil," because I've fought this guy-- 
Klaus: 
Connor: I'm not telling you anything. And-- if you think if you kill me, it's gonna be over-- there's another waiting to take my place.
Damon: See, this is what I like to hear; vague threats, ominous prophecies, disappearing tattoos.
Klaus: What do you mean, tattoos?
Damon: Don't bother, you can't see the damn thing.
Klaus: There's more to you than meets the eye, isn't there?
Klaus: Nice try, but I'm faster than your average vampire.
Klaus: You're one of the Five.
Damon: The what?
Connor: And I'm faster than your average hunter.
Stefan: Come on Klaus, where the hell are you?
Stefan: Hey.
Elena: Why am I thinking about you?
Damon: Because you're a vampire now. And part of you knows you're a lot more like me than you are like him.
Stefan: 
Klaus: I did. And for future reference, one voicemail is just as effective as nine.
Klaus: What's wrong, love?
Stefan: She has werewolf venom in her system. You know you're the only one that can heal her, Klaus. Please.
Klaus: And what would you have done if I were no longer here? Hm? If you and your friends had succeeded in ridding the world of me? Let's play that game for a moment, shall we?
Stefan: Whatever you want from me...
Klaus: 
Klaus: Her, on the other hand...
Klaus: Yes. There we go.
April: Hey.
April: Way to bail on your own party.
Rebekah: I just. I needed a minute. Did everyone leave?
April: Yeah, deputies weren't actually super-happy about the anti-curfew party.
Rebekah: Why are you still here?
April: Um, honestly? Picking up trash is a hell of a lot better than sitting at home alone thinking about the family you no longer have.
Rebekah: Hey, uh, if you want, I could...I could help you look into what happened with the fire at your farmhouse.
April: What are you going to be able to do that I can't?
Rebekah: 
Carol: So, the sniper was inside?
Damon: Yep, still is. In tiny little pieces.
Carol: Good. I'll cancel the curfew and call off the extra patrols. I can't say I approve of your methods...
Damon: 
Jeremy: See? I told you I could be a badass.
Damon: Shhh, badasses don't say that. 
Damon: Nice job.
Meredith: You told me the plan was to lead him to the storage room.
Damon: And we did! Congrats.
Meredith: You left out the part about blowing up a hospital! With patients who are sick and fragile and who don't need things exploding down the hall from them!
Damon: It was contained. Nobody got hurt. Come on, buy me a farewell drink. 
Meredith: 
Caroline: Hey.
Stefan: Hey. Thanks for coming.
Caroline: Not every day I get summoned by a Salvatore. So, what's up?
Stefan: 
Caroline: You mean an insecure control-freak?
Caroline: Yeah.
Stefan: You grew into yourself when you became a vampire. You changed. And Elena, she's changing too, and I want her to be able to enjoy it, without all the guilt and shame that I went through. And there was a moment today when she did. And when I'm with her, every bone in my body tells me to join her. To enjoy it. But, I know that if I do, even a little, I risk becoming him...the Ripper. I love her, and I don't want to hold her back.
Caroline: But you don't know how to be around her and still resist that urge.
Stefan: Damon promised he'd help me stay off the edge, but he and I...we're not in a very good place right now. Not when it comes to her. I just thought, you're so good at it, at being a vampire.
Caroline: 
Matt: Elena, hey! If I had known you were gonna go to that party, I never would have told Connor about Rebekah.
Elena: I already had this conversation with Jeremy. There's no way you guys could have known that I would go, I mean, I was surprised that I went.
Elena: Stefan warned me that I would feel things more powerfully, but Matt, the hatred that I felt today? I almost–I almost killed her, in front of everyone, in the middle of a party. That's not me. At least, it didn't–it didn't used to be.
Matt: Honestly, Elena, Rebekah kind of deserves it.
Elena: Yeah, but it's not just about Rebekah, it's about my mind.
Elena: I'm having these terrible thoughts-- these violent images and I-- it's all driven by one simple thing: this hunger.
Matt: 
Matt: Elena. Elena, that hurts. Elena. Elena!
Matt: Elena! Elena!
Damon: Stop! Stop.
Elena: Oh my God. Matt, I'm sorry. I'm so-I'm so sorry. I didn't-I didn't mean to--
Damon: 
Elena: What have I done?
Damon: Nothing you should be ashamed of. You are a vampire now. You just have to learn the right way to be one. And I'm gonna teach you.
Connor: You saved me.
Klaus: Congratulations, you just became worth more to me alive than dead.
Connor: What-what did you mean when you said I was one of the Five?
Klaus: You don't know your own history?
Klaus: Well, let's just say, it's made you the most well-protected vampire hunter in town.
