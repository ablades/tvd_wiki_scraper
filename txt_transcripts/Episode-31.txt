Bulgaria 1490




Mother: A little more dearest, a little more. Push....a little more. A little more. A little more. Push!




Mother: It's a girl.

Katherine: A girl. Please mother, let me see her.

Father: Woman, don't! What are you doing?




Katherine: Let me at least hold her once...just once.

Father: Forget it! You have disgraced this family.




Katherine: Father, please! No, father, no!

Mother: No Katerina, it's better for her! It's better for her!




Katherine: No mother, please...

Mother: Let her go...let her go Katerina.

Katherine: Please, mama...

Salvatore Boarding House




Damon: Hello, Elena.

Elena: Is Stefan here? He called. He said it was important.

Damon: Right this way.




Stefan: Hey.

Elena: What is this about?




Elena: You.




Rose: Okay, you have to understand I only know what I've picked up over the years and I don't know what's true and what's not true. It's the problem with all this vampire crap but Klaus, I know he's real.

Elena: Who is he?

Damon: He's one of the originals, he's a legend.

Stefan: From the first generation of vampires.

Elena: Like Elijah?

Rose: No. Elijah was the Easter bunny compared to Klaus. He's a foot soldier. Klaus is the real deal.

Stefan: Klaus is known to be the oldest.

Elena: Okay, so you're saying that the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me?

Rose: Yes.

Stefan: No.

Damon: What they're saying is, I mean if what she's saying is true...

Rose: Which it is.

Damon: And you're not saying it so I don't kill you.

Rose: Which I'm not.

Damon: Then we're looking at a solid maybe.

Stefan: Look, Elijah's dead, right? So no one else even knows that you exist.

Rose: Not that you know of.

Damon: That's not helping.

Stefan: Look, I've never even met anyone who's laid eyes on him. I mean, we're talking centuries of truth mixed with fiction. We don't know if he's real. For all we know he could just be some sort of stupid bed time story.

Rose: He's real and he doesn't give up. If he wants something, he gets it. If you're not afraid of Klaus, then you're an idiot.

Damon: Alright, we're shaking. You made your point.




Stefan: Where are you going?

Elena: School. I'm late.

Stefan: Let me grab my stuff, I'll go with you.

Elena: It's okay, I know where it is.




Damon (to Rose): She's in denial.

Stefan: Shut up, Damon.

Mystic Falls High School




Jeremy: Here, I got it.

Bonnie: Thanks. Where's Elena?

Jeremy: She's actually running late today. What are you doing later? You want to hang out at the grill, shoot some pool? The winner owns the table.

Bonnie: Uh, why?

Jeremy: Why what?

Bonnie: Well, you never asked me to play a game of pool before so why now?

Jeremy: Uh, I don't know, I thought it'd be fun, never mind.

Bonnie: No, hey, okay. Sure. It's just...

Jeremy: Just what?

Bonnie: It's just you're Elena's brother and...sure. It's just, I'm really bad at pool.

Jeremy: Yeah, yeah. I thought you might be.




Luka: Excuse me! Do you guys know which way is the office?

Jeremy: Yeah, yeah. Through the double doors then straight ahead, quick left and then your first right. You must be new here.

Luka: Yeah, I am. It's kind of hard to hide it. My name's Luka.

Jeremy: I'm Jeremy, this is Bonnie.

Luka: Hi, Bonnie.




Jeremy: Anyway, Luka. I'm actually heading in that direction. Why you don't follow me? It can get confusing.

Luka: Thanks man. It's nice to meet you Bonnie.




Woods




Elena: Tell everyone I wasn't feeling well and I went home from school.

Caroline: I can't believe I'm agreeing to this. I'm a terrible liar.

Elena: And keep Stefan busy. I don't want him to know what I'm up to.

Caroline: I'm even worse at duplicity and you know this.

Elena: You managed to keep me occupied when Katherine paid Stefan a visit.

Caroline: Yeah, because she threatened me. Not that I'm saying that you should use that as a tactic, it's...Stefan's gonna see right through me.

Elena: Caroline, as my friend, do you promise or not?

Caroline: You had to break out the girlfriend code. Okay. I promise.

Elena: Okay.

Caroline: Why don't you want Stefan to know?

Elena: Because he would never be okay with me doing this.




Caroline: Are you sure you want to do this?

Elena: Yes, I'm sure. She's the only one who knows the truth about Klaus. The only one who can tell me how to stop him.

Caroline: But you're asking for the truth from someone who's probably never giving it. Are you sure about this?

Elena: Yeah. I can't just sit back and wait. I have to know, Caroline. Please.




Elena: Katherine?




Elena: I'll be okay from here.




Katherine: Hello Elena. You come to watch me wither away? Goodbye Caroline.

Elena: As long as I stay on this side of the door, she can't hurt me. Please.




Katherine: Stefan know you're here?

Elena: I brought you some things.

Katherine: You came to bribe me? What is it that you want?

Elena: I want you to tell me about Klaus.

Katherine: Hmm, you've been busy.

Elena: I also brought you this.




Elena: It's your family history. It says in here that the family line ended with you. Obviously that's not true.

Katherine: You think that if you brought me some family keepsake that I'd open up?

Elena: I also brought you this.




Elena: You don't look so good. How long before your body shuts down? 10, 20 years? It must be painful to desiccate and mummify. I can't even imagine.




Katherine: You have the Petrova fire.

Elena: More blood?




Katherine: It's a long story, Klaus and I. It goes all the way back to England, 1492, after I left Bulgaria. Or was thrown out.




Elena: Thrown out?

Katherine: My family, your true ancestors, they disowned me. My indiscretions were not tolerated at that time. I had a baby out of wedlock. The shame.

Elena: It was kept secret?

Katherine: Mhmm. My baby was given away. I was banished to England and I had to learn to adjust. So I quickly became English. It was there that I caught the eye of a nobleman named Klaus. I was taken with him at first, til I found out what he was and what he wanted from me. And then I ran like hell.

England 1492




Elijah: She's here. Katerina! I know you're near, I can smell your blood. It's pointless to run, Klaus will find you wherever you are.




Trevor: This way. There is more blood over there.




Trevor: Head east. I can't lead them astray anymore.

Katherine: I can't run anymore.

Trevor: Never mind. There's a cottage. You'll be safe there. Go now. Go!




Fell's Church Ruins

Elena: So, what did Klaus want?

Katherine: The same thing that he'll want from you. He wants to break the curse.

Elena: By sacrificing the Petrova doppelgänger.

Katherine: He wanted to drain every single drop of blood from my body.

Salvatore Boarding House




Damon: All right Rosebud. I need some answers. Oh please don't tell me you're crying ‘cause your buddy Trevor lost his head.

Rose: You've always been this sensitive?

Damon: Full vampire switch for this very reason. Takes the emotion out of it.

Rose: Yeah, you switch yours, I'll switch mine.

Damon: Is that a dig?

Rose: It's an observation. Being in love with your brother's girlfriend must be difficult.

Damon: I'm not in love with anyone.

Rose: You want to try that again?

Damon: Don't get on my bad side.

Rose: Then show me your good side.

Damon: How do I find Klaus?

Rose: You don't find Klaus, he finds you.

Damon: Come on. Somebody's got to know somebody who knows where he is, right?

Rose: Add another two hundred somebodies to that and you're still not even close.

Damon: Humor me. You got in touch with Elijah, how did you do it?

Rose: Through a very low somebody on the totem pole. A guy named Slater in Richmond.

Damon: Perfect. I'll drive.

Rose: No. You forget not all of us can do sun.

Damon: Then you drive. Come on.

Mystic Falls High School

Caroline: Stefan!

Stefan: Hey.

Caroline: Hey. Uh, I need to talk to you. Where are you going?

Stefan: Well, Elena went home sick; I just want to go check up on her.

Caroline: Ditch her.

Stefan: I'm kind of worried about her.

Caroline: You know what? Of course you are. Go ahead, I'd...you know what? We can talk later.

Stefan: Uh, talk about what?

Caroline: I might have done something.

Stefan: What did you do?

Caroline: Told Tyler I'm a vampire.

Fell's Church Ruins




Elena: What does the Petrova blood line have to do with Klaus?

Katherine: It's really tedious but...




Katherine: The curse was bound by the sacrifice of Petrova blood. Witches are crafty with their spells. The doppelgänger was created as a way to be able to undo the spell. Once the doppelgänger reappeared, the curse can be broken.

Elena: So you ran before he killed you?

Katherine: Something like that.

England 1492




Katherine: Help, please help me.




Katherine: Please, help me.

Woman: I don't invite strangers into my home.

Katherine: No, Trevor. He said that you'd help me.




Rose: Damn him. Always making promises I don't want to keep.




Rose: Let the girl in.




Rose: Bring her water and something to eat.

Katherine: You must be Rose. Thank you. Trevor said to show you this.




Katherine: To prove I am who I say and that you'd help me to freedom.

Rose: You stole this from Klaus?

Katherine: It was to be part of the sacrifice ritual, so I grabbed it and made my escape.

Rose: People do not escape from Klaus. Everyone who tries ends up back in his grasp and anyone who helps them dies.

Katherine: I know the risk you bring on yourself by giving me aid.

Rose: I'm risking nothing. At nightfall, I'll bring you back to Klaus and beg him to show us both mercy.




Katherine: No! No!




Coffee Shop




Damon: Back entrance. How convenient.

Rose: That's the point. We can't all have little daylight rings.

Damon: How do you know this Slater guy is even here?

Rose: I called him. He's here. He's always here.

Damon: Good.




Damon: Just one thing. If you're setting me up in any way, I will rip your heart out and shove it down your throat. It's something I'm very good at.




Rose: I'm older than you and stronger. Don't get on my bad side.




Rose: You can trust me.




Damon: Whoa. What about the sunlight?

Rose: Double paned and tempered. UV rays can't penetrate. You see the appeal now?




Slater: That and the free Wi-Fi.




Rose: Hey, how are you?

Slater: Good. I saw you come, what are you doing here?

Rose: Mmm, it's a long story but I want you to meet...

Slater: Damon Salvatore. Turned 1864 in Mystic Falls by Katherine Pierce aka Katerina Petrova. So I take it I was right, what I told you about the tomb under the church was true?

Rose: Yes. It was right. Thank you for the tip.




Slater: It's nice to meet you, maybe. What's going on Rose? Where's Trevor?

Fell's Church Ruins

Elena: Rose never ended up taking you back to Klaus, did she?

Katherine: No, but not because she had a change of heart.

England 1492




Rose: It's nightfall. Time to go.




Rose: When did this happen?

Katherine: In the woods, I tripped.

Rose: It's a lie, I would have smelled it.




Katherine: I'd rather die than go back to Klaus. Please, just let me die.

Rose: If you die then Trevor dies with you.




Katherine: No. No!

Trevor: Where is she?




Rose: You have set us both on the path of death. I only hope Klaus sees the honor in returning that girl to him.

Trevor: He will sacrifice her.

Rose: Then so be it!

Trevor: I love her, Rose.

Rose: He'll kill you. He won't stop until he has all of our heads.

Trevor: Then we shall run until we die.




Fell's Church Ruins

Elena: You killed yourself?!

Katherine: Klaus needed a human doppelgänger. As a vampire, I was no longer any use to him.

Elena: But it didn't work. You didn't really escape, you've been running from Klaus ever since.

Katherine: I underestimated his spirit for vengeance but living in a suitcase is better than dying so you can have your blood spilled over some silly little rock.




Katherine: What's wrong? Afraid I'm right? You don't want to die? There's another way out.




Katherine: Better hurry. Your opportunity is going, going, going and gone. I made the other choice.

England 1492




Trevor: What did you do, Katerina? I would have helped you live.

Katherine: You would have helped me run. That was never going to be enough.

Trevor: It was enough for me.

Rose: Do you not see, Trevor? She used you to help her escape and me to turn her. Klaus will see our role in this.

Katherine: And for that I'm sorry.

Rose: As am I....for this.




Katherine: Please understand.

Rose: You have just signed our death sentence.

Katherine: Better you die than I.




Fell's Church Ruins

Elena: Rose and Trevor spent the last 500 years running because you used them. Trevor just got killed.

Katherine: I never thought he would last that long.

Elena: You don't even care that you ruined their lives.

Katherine: I was looking out for myself, Elena. I will always look out for myself. If you're smart, you'll do the same.




Mystic Grill




Caroline: Sorry to drag you here but if I don't eat, I get those kill innocent people urges. Tyler totally has those too by the way.

Stefan: Yeah, what else did you say to him?

Caroline: Not much. I was trying to keep the questions to a minimum. Are you mad?

Stefan: Yes Caroline. As a matter of fact, I am a little mad. I mean, you put yourself a risk. If Damon finds out...

Caroline: But you're not gonna tell him, are you?

Stefan: No, of course not. He would kill you.

Caroline: Always looking out for me.

Stefan: Yeah. Well, you don't exactly make it very easy on me.

Caroline: Then why do you do it? Why are you such a good friend to me?

Stefan: I don't know. I guess you...you remind me of someone. My best friend, Lexi.

Caroline: I...you have a friend?

Stefan: You say that with such a discouraging amount of surprise, Caroline.

Caroline: No I just...sorry. I just...tell me about her.

Stefan: I will, some other time. I got to go.

Caroline: Wait! No! What do we do about Tyler? I don't want Damon to kill him ‘cause there's a full moon coming up and Tyler is totally freaking out about it.




Luka: Hey Bonnie.

Bonnie: Hey, Luka. How was your first day?

Luka: It was great. I would like to introduce you to my dad.

Bonnie: Hi, I'm Bonnie Bennett.

Jonas: Doctor Martin, Jonas Martin. It's nice to meet you Bonnie Bennett. Would you like to join us?

Bonnie: Oh, I'm meeting a friend but he's not here yet so...sure.

Luka: Oh yes, please have a seat.




Bonnie: So, where did you move from?

Jonas: Louisiana.

Bonnie: That's a big change.

Luka: I'll say.

Bonnie: It's not so bad here.

Luka: It's looking up.

Jonas: Bennett, huh? I knew some Bennett's when I did my residency in Massachusetts. Do you have any family from Salem?

Bonnie: Actually I do.

Jonas: What do you know? Small world, right?




Bonnie: Oh, there's my friend. It was nice to meet you, Doctor Martin.

Luka: I will see you at school.

Bonnie: Yeah.




Jeremy: Sorry I was late, are you okay?

Bonnie: Yeah.

Coffee Shop

Slater: And you're sure Elijah's dead?

Damon: Beyond dead.

Slater: Trevor was a good man; he helped me with my dissertation on sexual deviance in the Baroque period. I was schooling for my Psych PhD.

Rose: Slater's been in college since '74.

Slater: When I was turned. I have 18 degrees, 3 master's and 4 PhDs.

Damon: The point?

Slater: Exactly, I mean, what is the point? What should I be doing with my eternity? If you have an answer, please enlighten me.

Rose: We need your help. If someone wanted to get in touch with Klaus, how would you hook him up?

Slater: Craigslist.

Damon: Really?

Slater: Seriously. I respond to a personal ad to get sent to somebody who knows somebody who knows Elijah, who's dead and that's where my connection ends.




Mystic Grill




Jeremy: You are bad.

Bonnie: I told you.

Jeremy: Well, feel free to cheat if you need your dignity back.

Bonnie: Come on, hit the ball.




Luka: Alright, I got a winner guys. I got a winner.

Jeremy: Get ready, this slaughter is almost over.




Bonnie: So where's your dad?

Luka: (Commenting on the shot.) Nice. (Answering Bonnie.) Um, I'll see him back home.




Stefan: Okay, now I'm leaving.

Caroline: Wait...!

Stefan: No, no, no, Caroline, you have two seconds to come clean.

Caroline: What do you mean?

Stefan: I'd believe the whole innocent act a little bit better if I didn't know how good you were at providing a distraction on demand. Where is Elena?

Caroline: I can't tell you.

Stefan: You can't tell me? Are you kidding me?

Caroline: I'm sorry but I...I can't tell you.

Stefan: Caroline! Elena was kidnapped, she could have been killed and you're seriously not gonna tell me where she is?

Caroline: She's not in any danger. I would not have let her put herself in danger.

Stefan: Put herself in danger where? What do you...? She's with Damon, isn't she?

Caroline: Ew, no!

Stefan: Then where...where is she? Listen, if you're my friend like you've been pretending to be all day, then you'll tell me where she is.

Caroline: Stefan, I am your friend but I'm also Elena's friend and I'm sorry but I'm not going to tell you where she is.




Fell's Church Ruins

Elena: So how much of your little story is true?

Katherine: I have no reason to lie, Elena. I have no reason to do anything but sit here and read and rot.

Elena: Okay, assuming it's even partially true, that's the reason why you came back isn't it? Because you wanted to be the one to hand me over to Klaus.

Katherine: 500 years on the run, I figured maybe he'd be willing to strike a deal.

Elena: So you got Mason Lockwood to find you the moonstone.

Katherine: Right again.

Elena: What else do you need to break the curse?

Katherine: Hmm, look who is getting smarter.

Elena: It's not just me or the stone, is it? Otherwise there would be no reason to trigger Tyler Lockwood's werewolf curse.

Katherine: Witches and their spells: so many ingredients, so many people to sacrifice.

Elena: So you need a werewolf?

Katherine: Believe it or not, they're hard to come by.

Elena: What else?

Katherine: A witch to do the spell. Mine bailed but Bonnie will do just fine.

Elena: What else?

Katherine: A vampire.

Elena: Caroline.

Katherine: It could have been anyone I suppose but I like the poetry of Caroline.

Elena: So you were gonna just hand us all over to be killed?

Katherine: Better you die than I.




Coffee Shop

Damon: Here's what I don't get: Elijah moved around during the day, which means the originals knew the secret of the day ring. Now why would Klaus want to lift the curse of the sun and the moon?

Slater: To keep the werewolves from lifting it. If a vampire breaks the sun curse then the werewolves are stuck with the curse of the moon forever and vice versa.

Rose: But werewolves are extinct.

Slater: True. I've never seen one but rumor has it...

Damon: Not such a rumor.

Slater: Mystic Falls? God, I've got to visit this place. It sounds awesome.




Damon: Awesome doesn't even begin to describe it. Can we stop the curse from being broken at all?

Slater: What do you mean?

Damon: Well, if we make the moonstone useless, would it stop the curse from being broken?

Slater: Well, yeah, probably, but why would you want to do that?

Damon: Tell me how.

Slater: You think I'm gonna help you figure out how to do something that will piss off an original? And keeping them from walking in the sun?

Damon: You want to walk in the sun? I can make that happen if you help us.




Damon: You're gonna be okay.

Rose: I know.

Damon: Who's behind that?

Rose: I don't know. Where is Slater?

Damon: Iowa by now. Who the hell knows?

Rose: He's not behind this, he's a good guy, he wouldn't betray me.

Damon: Who did it?

Rose: It's Klaus, don't you understand? You don't know this man, we're dead, we're all dead.




Mystic Grill




Luka: Hey Bonnie. I'm sorry about earlier, my dad is not very subtle with the whole Bennett/Salem question. He picked up on you, he was just fishing around, he didn't mean any harm.

Bonnie: I felt something too.

Luka: I know. That's why we're having this conversation right now. He uh...doesn't like for anyone to know.




Luka: But we were both worry that you would bail us.




Luka: He just wants us to fit in here for once. It's tough Bonnie, being different.

Bonnie: You're a witch?

Luka: Well, we prefer the term warlock.

Fell's Church Ruins




Stefan: Elena.

Elena: Stefan, what are you doing here?

Stefan: I could ask you the same question.

Elena: Caroline told you.

Stefan: No, she kept your secret but it didn't take long for me to figure out what was the important that you'd have to keep it from me.

Elena: I knew that you'd stop me.

Stefan: Listen to me, whatever she said to you is a lie. Do not listen to her. She's a liar, Elena.

Elena: What if she isn't? You didn't hear what she said.

Stefan: You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

Elena: That's the problem, you won't but you'll die trying. How's that any better?




Katherine: There's nothing you can do, Stefan. I haven't even told you the best part of the story.

Bulgaria 1492




Katherine: No, no, no, mama. No!

Fell's Church Ruins

Katherine: He killed them, my entire family, just to get back at me for running. Whatever you do to escape Klaus, he will get his vengeance on your friends, your family and anyone that you've ever loved.




Stefan: No, look at me. No, do not listen to her, okay?

Katherine: Always the protector but even you must realize that she's doomed. There's nothing you can do to stop it unless of course you have this.




Elena: What?

Stefan: Oh no, there it is. It's the ultimate lie, isn't it? You spun this whole thing so that we would have to get the stone from you, didn't you?

Katherine: I didn't spin anything, Stefan. It's the truth.

Stefan: No, let me guess. You want to trade that stone for your freedom, you manipulative, psychotic bitch.

Katherine: My freedom? That's where you're wrong, Stefan. I don't want my freedom because when Klaus shows up to kill us all and he will, I'll be in the tomb, where no vampire will enter because they can't get out. I'll be the safest psychotic bitch in town.




Salvatore Boarding House




Rose: I'm sorry about today. I didn't know that was gonna happen.

Damon: I believe you.

Rose: I wish we could save Elena. I know that you want to.

Damon: And I will.

Rose: You remind me of Trevor.

Damon: Why? Why him?

Rose: Because he always talked a big game, he was always working on an angle but underneath it all, he was the best friend anyone could hope for.

Damon: And where did that get him?

Rose: Dead and my loyalty to him almost got me dead too.




Damon: To friendship.

Rose: You're right to fight it, the way you feel about her.

Damon: And why's that?

Rose: Because if you want to survive, you need to not care about anyone.

Damon: Caring gets you dead, huh?

Rose: It might just be time to turn the switch off on your emotions.

Damon: I will if you will.




Mystic Grill




Gilbert Residence




Stefan: Elena.

Elena: I can't talk about it, Stefan.

Stefan: You have to. Don't shut me out. Elena, please.




Elena: I wanted to know the truth and I got it. It's not just me that's in danger. It's Caroline and it's Tyler and it's Bonnie. They're all part of breaking the curse. I can't blame anyone else anymore because it's not because you came into town or because you and I fell in love. That's not why everyone that I love is in danger. It's because of me, everything is because of me.




Fell's Church Ruins




Salvatore Boarding House




Rose: It's a lie, you know. There's no switch you can turn off. Sure when you're a newbie but after a couple of hundred years...you just have to pretend.




Rose: Hello?

Slater: Rose?

Rose: Slater? Are you okay?

Slater: Yes, I took off, I'm sorry, I was frigging freaked.

Rose: No, I'm sorry to involved you.

Slater: Look, I want no part in any of this but I did some digging.

Rose: Okay, what did you find?

Slater: You can destroy the curse but you need the moonstone.

Rose: How? What do you mean? I don't follow.

Slater: Can your friend get the moonstone? You need it.




Rose: Yes, he can get it. What next?

Slater: You need a witch. Get the moonstone, a witch should be able to figure out the rest. Good luck, Rose.




Slater's Residence




Elijah: Very nicely done.

Slater: Thanks, I have a degree in theater. How can you compel me? A vampire can't compel another vampire.

Elijah: I'm a special vampire.

Slater: What, because you're an Original?

Elijah: Hmm, now I want you take this and drive it through your heart.




Slater: But that would kill me forever.

Elijah: I know.




Elijah: But it's necessary.




Jonas: Was it, really?

Elijah: It had to be done. He delivered his message. Won't be long now.
