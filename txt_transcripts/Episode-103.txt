: You think they fell in love milking cows?
Damon: Probably. Then she became one. So he drank himself into oblivion -- she cheated with the pastor.
Enzo: Just because you lost your true love doesn't mean you have to dump on others.
Damon: There's no love in there. Look at that picture, it's old! The milk maid's no where to be found -- it's just pathetic old farmer John.
Enzo: Manners! It's impolite to speak ill of our hosts.
Damon: I doubt he'll mind!
Enzo: Please. Alright cranky. (looking at his phone) It's been almost 8 hours since you last fed. So I suppose that's about right.
Damon: Are you timing me?
Enzo: You feed on vampires now. I am a vampire. The only way to ensure my safety is to know how long you can last until your next fix.
Damon: Or, you can just leave.
Enzo: I don't abandon my friends, Damon. Besides, if you hadn't come with me to kill Doctor Wes, he wouldn't have stuck you with that nasty virus.
Enzo: Ahh! Just in time.
: What did you do? What's happening?
Enzo: You died, but luckily you had my blood in your system, so when you drink this...
Enzo: You'll feel much better.
Enzo: There you are.
Damon: Good boy.
Man: What was that?
Enzo: That was blood. You're a vampire, congratulations!
Man: I'm a what?
Enzo: I know, I know. It's overwhelming and Damon will explain more in a bit, but before he does, settle a bet. Your wife, where is she?
Man: Wait.. I drink blood now?
Enzo: Again, we'll explain everything. Where's your wife?
Man: She's gone... she left me years ago.
Damon: Pastor? Pastor?
Man: Pharmacist.
Enzo: Ahhhhhh!
: Yes! I will take that as a win for me, not for you.
Enzo: Stop trying to scare me, Damon. I'm not leaving you. I'm the only friend you have left.
CREDITS:
Stefan: Roman empire
Katherine: 476 A.D. sacked by the goths
Stefan: Han Dynasty
Katherine: 220 A.D.
Stefan: Holy Roman Empire
Katherine: Not really an empire, but 1648
Stefan: There goes your perfect score!
Katherine: What? No! That was right.
Stefan: No, no, no. The book says it was 1806
Katherine: Okay, well 1806 may technically be right, but it was the Peace of Westphalia that truly ended the empire and that was in 1648, trust me.
Katherine: I may have done a paper on the Holy Roman Empire in high school.
Stefan: Well if you want to pass the test I suggest you write down exactly what's in the textbook.
Stefan: Oh, Caroline's here, I asked the sheriff to help me track down Damon.
Caroline: You were right. He's off the rails. This is from my mom.
Stefan: Let me guess: missing persons and animal attacks?
Caroline: Check and check, but there's something else. All of the victims were found inside their homes without their head... and their skin was desiccated.
Stefan: Damon's feeding on vampires...
Stefan: I shouldn't have let him go.
Caroline: No. Uh uh. No, You are not turning Damon's roosting chickens into a Stefan Salvatore guilt trip. No one could've stopped him from going after Wes the other night.
Stefan: I guess Wes must have injected him with whatever he was going to give Elena that makes vampires feed on vampires.
Caroline: Ah. Good news, bad news. Bad news is that when this happened to Jesse, we had to kill him, but the good news is... I'm sorry, usually there's some good news.
Stefan: I have to find him.
Katherine: Well, I can come with you.
Caroline: Elena, hey! I didn't know that you were here.
Katherine: Well, Stefan has been helping me study.
Caroline: Oh. Stefan who doesn't go to college.
Katherine: Stefan, who's an expert in history.
Caroline: Uh-huh.
: It's Tyler. I haven't really spoken to him since the, um, incident.
Stefan: The incident? You mean the time when he almost killed you?
: Hey.
Tyler: Hey. Have you talked to Matt?
Caroline: No. Why?
Tyler: Because it turns out that Nadia has been compelling him to forget things.
Tyler: Matt said he was going to avoid her, but I haven't heard from him.
Caroline: Do you think that he's in trouble?
Tyler: I think he hasn't been at home or work and his phone goes straight to voicemail.
Caroline: Okay. Well, I'll come right over..
: No. That's not why I called..
Caroline: No, I know, I think that we can figure this out together. I'll see you soon.
Katherine: Maybe I should come with you?
Caroline: No. No. You deal with Damon. We can handle this. Besides, it's time we move into the next phase of our post-break-up, pre-friendship relationship timeline.
Katherine: Okay. I'm going to stay out of that one. I'm going to get some clothes and you'll pick me up at my dorm?
Stefan: Sure.
Stefan: The bad news is that Tyler hates you. The good news is..... hmmm
: It'll be fine.. We both have weird ex-friend situations.
Stefan: We... there's nothing weird going on between me Elena and me.
Caroline: Come on, Stefan! First, she tells you she's going to fight to get Damon back and then she re-breaks up with him and now she's here, with you, her ex "studying."
Stefan: She's here with her friend studying without the implied quotes.
Caroline: Well, look, I'm just saying that Elena and Damon's break-up is messy and you are not messy.  You're stable and sane and...
Stefan: I'm about to spend 12 hours in a car with her alone, so whatever she's feeling, I'm sure I'll be able to figure it out.
DINER:
: What's going on with Matt?
Nadia: Nothing.
Katherine: Really? Because Goldilocks and the big bad wolf are meeting to pow wow about him as we speak.
Nadia: Fine. Matt found out about you.
Katherine: He what!?
Nadia: Tyler gave him vervain.
Katherine: Kill him.
Nadia: Katherine..
Katherine: Kill him. Now.
Nadia: He doesn't need to die. The vervain will be out of his system soon and I've kept him out of sight for the last two days, so he hasn't told anyone.
Katherine: So, you two have just been tucked away, canoodling?
Nadia: I don't even know what that means.
Katherine: We all love Matt Donovan. Otherwise, he would've been dead a long time ago, but when it comes to keeping my new doppelgänger body a secret, no body is that important, but I am going out of town with Stefan, He wants to find Damon.
Nadia: I thought you wanted Damon out of the picture.
Katherine: I do, but I saw an opportunity to be alone with Stefan for a few days and well, I took it.
Nadia: And what happens when you get too close? Too comfortable. What happens when you slip up. Will you kill your precious Stefan too?
Katherine: Using my own words against me.. now that's a Petrova specialty. Take care of the Matt issue before I get back into town, or I'll do it myself.
Matt: It'll be fine. I just need to convince my friends I'm okay. I'll keep your secret. No one has to die.
Nadia: Relax. I'm not going to syrup you to death.
Nadia: What's canoodling?
FARMHOUSE:
Enzo: I didn't realize you liked to play with dolls.
Damon: Well, my brother likes to make a big show-- set them up, put their heads back on and pretend like it didn't happen. I, on the other hand, couldn't give a crap.
Enzo: Well, we've got 8 hours until you need to feed again. I wonder, what New York's like these days.
Damon: Crowded.
Enzo: Perfect. Let's go.
Enzo: What is that?
Damon: It's the obnoxious theme song of the travelers.
Damon: Ahhh. No!
Wes: As a man of science, I always considered magic a cheat.  Turns out, I cheat. How's the appetite?
Damon: Funny you should ask, I was just craving a blond.
Wes: You're my patient zero, Damon. I couldn't let you ride off into the sunset without running a few tests.
Enzo: A few tests...
Wes: Well, one test. Now that you’re trapped with only one source of food, how long can you go before you feed on your best friend?
:
STATION:
Katherine: You ever think about getting a new car?
Stefan: What are you talking about? This car is a classic.
Katherine: Yeah and so is the Wright brother's plane, but  you don't see people still flying around in that thing,
Stefan: You know, uh, I appreciate you being here, but you didn't have to come.
Katherine: I told you, I'm doing this for you. Because you're still holding on to hope that maybe this is the time that Damon can be saved.
Stefan: and you don't think he can? Look. I know that he crossed the line with Jeremy, but, you know, he has crossed many lines before.
Katherine: You mean when he actually killed Jeremy. Yes, I recall.
Stefan: I'm just saying, you've never really closed him off like this before.
Katherine: I mean.. Obviously, I still care about Damon, I guess I got my hopes up too many times. I want off the emotional roller-coaster that is Damon's redemption. You know It's just, just, dizzying. Are you hungry because I'm just starving.
Stefan: Uhh. Sure. What do you want?
Katherine: Whatever you're having, with a lot more salt and maybe covered in chocolate.
Stefan: Coming right up.
FARMHOUSE:
Enzo: Give it up mate. Those travelers sealed this whole place up tight.
Damon: The spell can't last forever.
Enzo: It doesn't need to. Wes only needs it to last 8 hours. Remember? Then he can come back inside and autopsy my mangled corpse.
Damon: You're pretty zen about all this.
Enzo: Did you forget everything I taught you in that cell? Calmer heads will always prevail.
Damon: Always the soldier.
Enzo: But you do have people we can call, like your brother or your ex. They can find Wes and threaten him, or maim him. Anything that doesn't involve your fangs on my neck.
Damon: My brother told me to leave and not come back. I'm not calling him.
Enzo: So my life is not worth your pride?
Damon: They won't come
Enzo: or they will and you might hurt them. You don't want to risk them, do you? Me, on the other hand...
Damon: I'm not going to feed on you. I'll find another way.
HOUSE:
Caroline: Thank you. mm.. good coffee. (trying to break the tension) Although I usually take mine with a little more awkward silence.
Tyler: Nice try, but you don't take anything with silence.
Caroline: SO, Matt. Um, he's missing?
Tyler: He's not missing, he just hasn't been home for two days and he's not answering his phone.
Caroline: Matt?
Matt: Caroline.. What are you doing here?
Tyler: Kind of wondering the same thing. Where the hell have you been?
Nadia: Did I give you my sunglasses? Oh.. I thought you said they wouldn't be home.
Caroline: Okay, Rewind, start over. This whole time, you've been with Nadia?
Matt: It's a long story. Nadia, come on in.
STATION:
: Hey, can you hold this for a second?
Katherine: Yeah.
Stefan: Careful, there's grease on it.
Katherine: Oh. Okay.
Stefan: I have no idea how this hose ripped out, but we're not going to be able to go anywhere until I get a new one.
Stefan: Ahh. I guess I'll see if that mechanic has a spare.
Stefan: You weren't careful at all.
Katherine: What? What?
Katherine: Ohh! I love this shirt!
Stefan: You loved that shirt.
Katherine: Great. Awesome... That's just awesome.
Stefan: Now there's grease all over your face.
Katherine: UGH! Well, you've got all that engine stuff on you, and I clearly have to change. I saw a hotel, like, a couple streets down that way. Do you think we should get a room, so that we can shower while we're waiting for the car?
Stefan: No. I should probably stay here in case they finish early, but you can go.
Katherine: Give them your phone number. I assume that your phone does receive incoming calls, right? Or is it from the Han Dynasty, just like your car?
Stefan: That's funny.
Katherine: Will you grab my bag?
Stefan: Sure, Be right there.
:
HOUSE:
Matt: I was on my way out of town and then there she was, sitting on the front steps, waiting for me.
Nadia: Subtlety's not my strong-suit. I felt bad about compelling him; and bad about snapping your neck. Again, subtlety.
Tyler: So why haven't you been answering your phone?
Matt: Uh... I lost it the first night.
Caroline: First night where?
Nadia: Atlantic City. I'd never been and neither had Matt.
Matt: One drink led to three and that led to five and.. uh.. the rest is kind of a blur.
Caroline: Yes because she's compelling you!
Matt: Caroline! I'm wearing vervain. (he holds up his arm and shows her his bracelet) She's not compelling me.
Caroline: Where have you been the last two days.
Matt: I told you, she's not compelling me. We're having fun.
Caroline: Fun? Oh come on! Just like the time when she buried you alive. WOOAHH. Pop open the champagne.
Nadia: I thought you said she'd be  cool with us hanging out?
Caroline: and what the hell is that supposed to mean?
Matt: Uhh..
Nadia: It means you've done nothing but judge Matt since he walked through that door, when everyone here knows that you're not exactly winning friends with your romantic choices. Isn't that right, Tyler?
Tyler: I don't want to be part of this.
Caroline: She's just trying to get under our skin to distract us.
Tyler: From what? This is Matt we're talking about. Did you forget that time he went to Europe with Rebekah after she ran his truck off the road?
Caroline: You're not seriously buying all of this?
Tyler: Hell of a lot easier to buy than other things that have happened.
ROOM:
Stefan: (carrying all of Katherine's bags): What did you do, bring your entire closet?
Katherine: Well, I didn't know how long we'd be gone, and let's be honest, Damon's spirals require a little more than an overnight bag.
Stefan: Hmm. We'll get him back. He's hurt, but he's not a lost cause.
Katherine: What makes you think that?
Stefan: Because I know what he's going through.
Katherine: What do you mean?
Stefan: You don't know what it's like being in love with you. You know, when you and I were together, every single atom in my body told me that it was the right thing, that we were a perfect fit. And that kind of love, it can change your whole life. And then when somebody who made you feel that way suddenly stops, the vacuum is just...
Katherine: I get it. They built a whole prophecy around it.
Stefan: He's not handling it right, but he's not gone.
Katherine: You need a refill.
Stefan: uhh. I should go wash up.
Katherine: Okay.
FARMHOUSE:
Enzo: Towing chains, farmer's best friend. In about an hour, mine. Take a seat.
Damon: They're not gonna to let us out of here until I kill you, or you kill me.
Enzo: Don't be dramatic. We'll work something out.
Damon: There's no cure, Enzo. Not for this.
Enzo: You've given it all of two days! That's what you do, isn't it?There's a problem, you run. You did it to me, you did it to your girl...
Damon: Because when I stay, I destroy things.
Enzo: We're not all as fragile as you think we are.
Damon: What the hell are you doing?
Enzo: Calling for backup.
Damon: I thought I told you not to call them!
Enzo: And I told you your pride isn't worth either of our lives.
ROOM:
: Oh my god, Damon?
Enzo: Hello "Stefan". How wonderful to hear your beautiful, feminine voice.
Katherine: Enzo. What the hell do you want?
Enzo: I'm in a spot of trouble, actually.
Katherine: Where's Damon?
Enzo: Oh, he's here, salivating, about to chomp into my neck and feed until my head pops off in a grotesque but slightly comical fashion.
Katherine: Wes infected him?
Enzo: You know about the virus. Good. We could use a hand. Wes enlisted some of those singing witches and trapped us in the house.
: Do Not. Come. Here.
Enzo: He doesn't want to risk feeding on you. That's sweet really, but you'll be fine. Besides, if he does feed on you, I have orders to kill him.
Katherine: Okay. Um, text me the address to my phone, and we'll be there as soon as we can.
Enzo: Fine. And, uh, Tick-tock. I managed to restrain him, but you know how persistent Damon can be when he wants something.
Katherine: We'll be there soon.
: You say something?
Katherine: No. Heh.
HOUSE:
Enzo: It'll be alright, mate. They'll come and we'll sort something out.
Damon: Or they'll come and I'll feed on them.
Enzo:  Those are also options. As long as I live, I'm good. Joking! Kind of.
: If you were aiming for my heart, you missed!
Maxfield: Don't worry, I wasn't. The chains were a good idea. Now, I can see exactly how strong he becomes when enraged.
Maxfield: Conclusion: very strong.
Enzo: Boy, do I miss the indestructible Augustine cage right about now.
Enzo: Damon, Stop! Damon, Stop! STOP! PLEASE, DAMON, STOP!
:
FARMHOUSE:
Travelers: Osoarmavas ocre item otum et sine.
Enzo: (begging Damon to stop feeding on him): Damon, Stop! Stop, please! Damon! Aah!
Enzo: What did you do to him?!
Maxfield: My friends here raised the acidity in your blood. There must be some witchy explanation for it, but Damon's basically drinking hydrochloric acid. I suggest you leave before the spell wears off.
Enzo: And go where... With you?
Maxfield: There's one more thing I need from you. Then I'll let you go for good. The other option is to stay in here with your cannibal friend and see how long you last.
Damon: Go Enzo! I tried to kill you, I'll do it again.
Enzo: No.
Damon: GO ,ENZO!
ROOM:
Stefan: (speaking over the running water): The car's done.
Katherine: I'll be right there.(Katherine gets a mischievous idea)
: Hey uh will you grab me my shirt? It's, uh, the green one right on top
Stefan: (Stefan starts to stare at Katherine) Yeah. Sure.
Katherine: Thanks.
: Wait, wait, wait. This is, uh, wrong. I mean, uh, You and Damon just split up.
Katherine: You don't have to, uh.. you're right. I'm, I'm sorry, I was just in, uh, a moment. I shouldn't have...
Stefan: Yeah. We have a long night ahead of us, so maybe we should just..
Katherine: Yeah. Uh.. You know, why don't you go, uh, settle the bill and I'll finish packing.
: Who do you think Stefan loves more: Damon, or Elena?
Nadia: Why are you calling me?
Katherine: Damon has been infected by the ripper virus and i know exactly where he is, so f I can get Damon to attack me, the only way to save me would to be for Stefan to kill him
Nadia: You want to make Stefan kill his brother? Dark. Even for you.
Katherine: Thank you. So, how goes it with Matty-blue-eyes? Dead yet?
Nadia: Still working on it. Good luck with your plan to win Stefan's love.
Matt: So. I'm curious, we've spent a couple of days together now...
Nadia: ...canoodling
Matt: Canoodling. Exactly. It seems like you went through all this trouble to save your Mom, but she only seems interested in Stefan.
Nadia: It's Katherine. I didn't expect mother-daughter boozy brunches.
Matt: Yeah, but you did expect something
Nadia: Are you going to play a card, or what?
Matt: Look, I've been where you are. My mom use to disappear for weeks at a time and then show up one day out of the blue and pretend like nothing happened. Before you know it, I'd be at the stove, making her a grilled cheese.
Nadia: This isn't like that.
Matt: Isn't it? She decides when you're worth it, on her watch, but guess what, you're never going to be as interesting as the next guy she wants to sleep with.
Nadia: Matt.. you'd say anything to help Elena. I'm not an idiot.
Matt: You are if you think Katherine's going to choose you. She's not.
Nadia: Do you know why you find yourself making all those sandwiches? Because the second your mom walked back into your life, you forgot all of those horrible things that she did because at the end of the day, she's still your mom and you love her.
Nadia: Give me your wrist
Nadia: The vervain is gone. Our fun is over.
Matt: Wait.. Since I'm going to forget this anyway...
Nadia: What was that for?
Matt: Thank you. If I'm going to be threatened and held against my will, I can think of worse scenarios.
Nadia: What the hell?
:
Matt: What'd you expect? Elena's my best friend. I'll always protect her.
Nadia: (putting on her jacket): It just sucks. You were the only decent person in this town.
Matt: And I still am. And so are you. You could've killed me this morning and you didn't. You're not like her and you know it.
Nadia: (compelling Matt): Forget everything you're not supposed to know. We partied, we slept together, then I left. Goodbye.
Caroline: Going somewhere?
Nadia: Actually, I am and you're in my way.
Caroline: Matt! Are you okay?
Matt: Yeah. Why? What's going on in here?
Caroline: You texted me from Nadia's phone.
: So, you compelled him again.
Nadia: and they say blondes are dumb.
Caroline: What are you doing to him! Tell me!
Matt: Nadia STOP!
Nadia: You might not remember, Matt, but this is your fault. Trust me.
Tyler: Young hybrid beats old vampire all the time.
Matt: Wait a second... Does anyone want to tell me how this is my fault?!
HOUSE:
Damon: (seeing Katherine, in Elena's body, standing at the door): Elena. Don't. Do not.
Damon: I said don't!
Damon: If you come in here, you ain't coming out.
Stefan: What exactly happened in here?
Damon: I wanted revenge. I got stuck with a vampire virus.. almost killed my last friend.. Typical Damon.
Katherine: Enzo texted me the address here. Damon, we're here to help you.
Damon: You can't help me! I feed on vampires now. You're both vampires. Do yourselves a favor and leave.
Stefan: Well, that's not going to happen.
Damon: (the veins are appearing under his eyes): Stay back!
Stefan: I'm not afraid of you, Damon
Katherine: Neither am I.
Damon: (seeing that she has come inside): No. No No.
Damon: You gotta get out
Damon: What the hell is wrong with you!
Katherine: I'm proving to you that you're not a lost cause, Damon.
Damon: Elena!
Katherine: See.
Katherine: Damon. You can resist this... you can do it. Why? Because you love me and that love is stronger than any craving
Damon: Get away from me, Elena.
Stefan: Elena, he's going to feed...
Katherine: No. No. He's not going to. He's not going to.. You can do this Damon
Katherine: There you go. Turn around.
Katherine: There you go
Stefan: Damon, STOP!
Stefan: Damon, Let go of her. Let go of her! LET GO!
Katherine: He's going to kill me!
Stefan: Here. Damon, look over here. Do you smell that? Feed on me, not on her.
Stefan: That's good. Feed on me. Feed on me
:
HOUSE:
: Well, the only thing that Matt remembers is that they slept together.
Tyler: Well.
: So..
Tyler: Car. I never said sorry.  I was pissed, but no excuses, okay?
Caroline: Look. We can get past this together. Okay. I just want us to be good again, you know?
Tyler: I said I was sorry. I didn't say I was past it.
Caroline: Of course. Obviously. I mean, Rome wasn't built in a day.
Tyler: How evolved do you think I am? You slept with Klaus. You slept with the guy that killed my mom. What's the fair amount of time for me to get past that? A week? A month? Tell me, what sounds right to you?
Caroline: Okay. You made your point.
Tyler: Look. I'm not trying to be a dick, but the idea of us being good... It's not gonna happen.
Caroline: Understood.
HOUSE:
Damon: Ahh. I know you can't help yourself, but if you bring home a rabid animal, you're gonna get bit. Ahg.
Stefan: I never should've told you to leave.
Damon: I'm going to kill you, Stefan. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but at some point, I'm going to rip open your throat and you're going to die.
Stefan: Ah. Come on, Damon. You think I'm afraid of a ripper? Who do you think invented the word? You know that feeling you get when you're around vampire blood? That burning in your veins.. I feel that on a daily basis and there's a way to control it.
Damon: and let me guess, it would bring you no greater pleasure than to teach me.
Stefan: No. That's a good guess, but right now, I'm going to go get you a little bit more vervain and then I'm going to go get another drink and let you think about what a royal pain in the ass you've been lately. You're my brother, I'm not going to give up on you. I never will.
Damon: She has.
Stefan: You're talking about Elena?
Damon: Mhmm.
Stefan: She practically got herself killed to prove a point today.
Damon: Do you remember the vampire ripper, Jesse? When he attacked me, Elena had to kill him, but if there was the slightest chance that there was another way to stop him, she would've taken it.
Stefan: Yeah. so.
Damon: She knew it would be impossible for me to resist her blood and then she just kicked you a stake and essentially told you to kill me.
Stefan: So, what are you saying? Are you saying that Elena wanted me to kill you?
Damon: You gotta another excuse?
Damon: That's what I thought.
DINER:
Katherine: So. I could use a steak.
Nadia: You're chipper. That must mean Damon is dead.
Katherine: Not exactly. In fact, he continues to be the bane of my existence, but Stefan and I had a moment. Don't worry. I'll keep the details to myself, but it definitely reaffirms his feelings for Elena. I.e. me. So it's only a matter of time.
Nadia: Sounds like you're going to get everything you want.
Katherine: Of course I will -- assuming you took care of the Matt situation,
Nadia: Your secret is safe.
Katherine: Perfect. So, I'm in a really good mood right now, which means I really don't feel like worrying about whatever's making you mopey.
Nadia: You won't have to worry about me for much longer.
Katherine: What's that supposed to mean?
Nadia: Tyler Lockwood bit me.
HOUSE:
Stefan: Hey. When'd you get here?
Caroline: Ahh.. About one and half of these ago.
Stefan: Hmm...
Caroline: You were right. I brought this on myself. I knew the Klaus thing was gonna come with consequences. Guess now I just have to deal with it and learn from my mistakes.
Stefan: Glad I could help. So, did you find Matt?
Caroline: Yes, and Tyler was right. Nadia's been compelling him to forget things.
Stefan: What do you mean? What kind of things?
Caroline: Who knows? He tried to message me, but Nadia stopped him.
Caroline: "Help. K" was all I got.
Stefan: Huh.
Caroline: So... You and Elena. What's the verdict?
Stefan: Um, well, the verdict is... she's acting strange. She kissed me.
Caroline: Excuse me?
Stefan: Yeah. My car broke down, so we got a hotel room so she could shower and...
Caroline: Woah, woah, woah, woah. You guys got a hotel room? With a shower?
Stefan: Yeah, but it wasn't like that.. I mean, I stopped it, obviously. I couldn't do it to Damon.
Caroline: Yeah, but she could?! I just.. I don't get it. She knows that this would destroy him, what does... what is she doing?
Stefan: That's what I mean, it's like she's given up on Damon; and he thinks that she was trying to get me to kill him tonight.
Caroline: No. I mean, she may be mad at him, but she would never want him dead.
Stefan: Unless... Matt texted you "help. K" before Nadia stopped him. "K", as in Katherine. And when Katherine was dying, Nadia figured out a way to put Katherine's spirit inside Nadia's body.
Caroline: Yeah, but that didn't happen because Katherine had a change of heart. No... No. You don't think that... It's impossible that she'd be... We would have noticed! It's Elena. We know her... Oh my God...
