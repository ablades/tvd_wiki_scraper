Caroline: Hello, I'm empty. More, please!
Bartender: I think you've had enough.
Caroline: Okay, look at my face. This is me straining to care less about what you think.
Caroline: Nope. I can't.
Bartender: Okay, I'm going to call you a cab.
Caroline: Okay, here's the thing-- my mum just died, as in I just put her dead, cancer-riddled body into the ground... 
Bartender: 
Caroline: Oh, no, no, no, I don't care about that. I'm just saying that my feet have been cramped in the world's most uncomfortable heels for an entire day, and your tequila is the only thing that seems to be helping.
Bartender: Okay, I'll grab you another drink.
Caroline: Thank you.
Liam: Caroline Forbes, the girl from the swimming hole.
Caroline: 
Liam: Ouch. And I was just about to tell you how sexy you looked.
Caroline: You are drunk.
Liam: Slightly buzzed! Getting my ass whooped in shuttleboard upstairs.
Caroline: Oh, lucky you! I stood all day at my mum's funeral. 
Liam: 
Caroline: Do you wanna get out of here?
Liam: 
Caroline: What, girlfriend? We all know you're not dating Elena Gilbert.
Liam: 
Caroline: 
Liam: Caroline, what the--?
Elena: It's like she never lived here. 
Stefan: Totally empty, Caroline took everything but the damn doors off the hinges.
Elena: So what? She just flips her humanity switch, came back to the dorm, took all of her clothes-- 
Stefan: This is coming from the girl that burned her house down.
Elena: Do you think she's trying to cut off all ties to her past?
Stefan: 
Elena: Okay, why are you getting mad at me? I'm not the one who did this.
Stefan: 
Elena: Okay, look. I'm just gonna look around campus, maybe someone's seen her just let me know if you find anything, okay?
Stefan: Alright. I will.
Bonnie: Looks like you could use a friend.
Elena: Oh, my god. Bonnie? 
Bonnie: 
Elena: Oh!
Kai: I can't believe Bonnie made it out! Actually, I can. She's plucky. Hey, do you need help? 
Damon: 
Kai: 
Damon: 
Kai: Oh, so you just - you just called me here because you needed a friend? No, you wanted to know if it was possible for her to exist in another prison world... to which I responded, "yes," to which you responded with denial.
Damon: 
Kai: Then who is it?
Damon: I don't know. A ghost? Maybe she has an evil Gemini twin.
Kai: 
Damon: If my mother was imprisoned in 1903, she'd be in her 70's.
Kai: Not if she were like you.
Damon: 
Kai: Uh, if you're so sure of that, why haven't you opened the coffin yet? 
Enzo: In the future, focus on my left side. It's far more attractive.
Sarah: 
Enzo: We've met before.
Sarah: Yes. You saved my friend Matt with your blood.
Enzo: Oh, yes. Uh, Sarah, right? Care to join me for a cup of tea? My best angle's up close and personal. 
Bonnie: My not-flannel blouse, my not-flannel t-shirts, and ooh! Ooh! I really missed my not-flannel V-neck.
Elena: Suck it, 1994! 
Bonnie: 
Elena: Okay.
Bonnie: Can we talk about the fact that I drove Jeremy away to art school?
Elena: So, does that make you his muse? Because eww.
Bonnie: Do me a favor? Don’t tell him I’m back yet.
Elena: Wait. You—you haven’t called him yet?
Bonnie: I just... I want to give him a chance at normalcy 
Elena: 
Bonnie: And I will, I’ll tell him. Coming back to life is complicated. Trust me, I’ve done it before. Besides, we have a roommate without her humanity and in need for a severe intervention.
Elena: Caroline! Um, you’re here.
Caroline: And you’re perceptive. 
Elena: 
Caroline: Starting over. New everything! 
Bonnie: I got out.
Caroline: 
Elena: 
Caroline: You mean, you were worried about those around me, like if I killed them? Okay. Funny story. You remember Liam? 
Elena: 
Caroline: I ate him! 
Bonnie: 
Caroline: 
Elena: 
Caroline: Fine. So I was feeding--
Caroline: 
Caroline: 
Liam: 
Caroline: Well, I was going to drain you of your blood, but now I’m not really in the mood to drag your corpse through the woods. Definitely not in these heels. I could throw you in a dumpster, but then everyone’s always being found in dumpsters, and since I was the last person to be seen with you, I’ll be questioned by the police, and what if one of them reminds me of my dead mother?
Liam: 
Caroline: 
Elena: 
Caroline: Elena, I shut off my humanity. I didn’t turn into an idiot. The last thing I want to do is give you a reason to ruin my life.
Bonnie: 
Caroline: 
Elena: 
Caroline: That’s all I want. Now granted, if anyone tries anything to flip my switch back on—- and I mean anything— 
Damon: 
Stefan: 
Damon: Well, even if she does... 
Stefan: Damon, if she kills somebody, I--
Damon: Not your fault, Stefan. By the time you figured out how you felt about her, it was too late. She made her choice.
Stefan: Just do me a favor. Check around Mystic Falls, see if anybody's missing?
Damon: Will do, brother. 
Kai: Whew, yeah, why tell your brother your mother's still alive? No, but I get it. Mom's in a prison world and therefore an evil psychopath. Don't want to ruin little bro's perfect-mommy memory.
Damon: I'll tell him as soon as I know the truth.
Kai: 
Damon: Which is why you're still here. Your sister sent me and Elena back to 1994. You can send me back to 1903.
Kai: Technically, yes, I am able to do that. But, I'll need the Ascendant for the 1903 Prison World.
Damon: Oh. As the newly elected president of the Gemini freaks, I assume you know where to get it. 
Kai: It's my pleasure.
Damon: 
Kai: 
Sarah: 
Enzo: A name is a very personal thing, Sarah. See? Doesn't that feel good?
Sarah: I have pictures of you, your veins doing weird, non-human things 
Enzo: 
Sarah: I want to know more about you.
Enzo: Fair enough. 
Sarah: 
Enzo: Three... I'm very rich.
Sarah: 
Enzo: 
Sarah: Does it look like I'm joking?
Enzo: Oh. You want to hear me say it. Fine. I'm a vampire.
Sarah: And?
Enzo: Perhaps you didn't hear me. I said I'm a vampire. You know, Anne Rice, Dracula, that dreadful "Twilight" series.
Sarah: No, I know what they are. I just thought there'd be more to it.
Caroline: It's okay. The whole vampire thing is over anyway.
Enzo: 
Caroline: Who is this nice girl we're divulging all of our deepest, darkest secrets to?
Sarah: I'm Sarah.
Caroline: Sarah. Photographer Sarah. Stefan's--
Enzo: Darling... 
Caroline: It is so nice not to care what you're up to with that poor girl. 
Enzo: 
Caroline: 
Enzo: 
Caroline: I'm actually a little bored, which is why I'm recruiting cute boys to come to Whitmore's Warehouse party tonight. You like to dance, right?
Enzo: Yeah, I love it.
Caroline: See you there.
Liam: Stefan. Hey, man.
Stefan: Hey. 
Liam: 
Stefan: Good. 
Liam: Uh... 
Stefan: 
Liam: We made out pretty hardcore.
Stefan: Was there any... biting involved?
Liam: 
Stefan: No. I meant, did she bite you?
Liam: Not that I remember. Are--are you into her or something? 
Stefan: 
Liam: Great! Can I get out of here, please? Because, like, I'm late for this party, and you're really weirding me out.
Stefan: What party?
Liam: Uh, warehouse party off campus. Caroline will be there if you want to watch.
Elena: 
Stefan: Hey. Uh, listen. I never thought I would ask this, but, um... Do you want to go to a rave?
Elena: Okay, not exactly the Welcome Home party I was planning for you but--I think we should split up and look for Caroline.
Bonnie: 
Elena: 
Caroline: 
Guy: Want to dance?
Bonnie: I'm actually looking for someone.
Guy: Come on, this is a party. Have fun!
Bonnie: Hey. Down, boy.
Guy: Just dancing.
Bonnie: Look, I really have to go find my friend.
Guy: I can't let you go. You're hot. 
Bonnie: 
Elena: Did he have any bite marks on him?
Stefan: No, which means she must have given him her blood.
Elena: And he doesn't remember her feeding on him at all?
Stefan: He remembers them making out-- in graphic detail-- but that's about it.
Elena: 
Stefan: No, it's not good. It means that she's gonna use him as a human blood bag every time she gets hungry.
Elena: Or she'll drink from the blood bags in our fridge that she just restocked.
Stefan: Wait a minute. Why are you defending her?
Elena: I'm just saying she hasn't actually hurt anyone, and there's no bodies that have shown up at the med center, no students are missing... What if she actually has this under control? You know, we give her her year, she's happy, and then--
Stefan: And then what? She magically flips her humanity switch and starts feeling everything that she's been putting off? Caroline is going to snap, and when she does, it's gonna be my fault. Because I am the reason that she did this.
Elena: 
Stefan: Her mother died, her world was turning upside down, and she asked me one simple question. All I had to do was tell her the truth, and I didn't. Now, look me in the eye and tell me that I couldn't have stopped this.
Elena: What's your plan?
Bonnie: 
Damon: Uh-Oh! Caroline go off the rails? If so, I called it.
Bonnie: Gloating in one of my best friend's times of need? It's weird that I miss you.
Damon: 
Bonnie: You think one phone call makes us friends?
Damon: You don't have to pretend, Bon. I'm like a fever you can't shake.
Bonnie: Yeah. Yeah. A disease.
Damon: 
Bonnie: Well, if scorching some douchebag with my magic is okay, then, yeah! Peachy. 
Damon: Oh, you mean the one where my brother was an auto mechanic, and my girlfriend forgot she loved me? Yep.
Bonnie: 
Damon: So... Teensy favor. I don't know if you know this, but when Kai merged with Luke, he went through a... metamorphosis. He went from a sociopathic caterpillar to a slightly less evil butterfly.
Bonnie: 
Damon: 
Bonnie: What was the favor?
Damon: Don't worry about it. I'll figure it out on my own. Happy raving!
Kai: Hey. Who was that?
Damon: Bonnie. She doesn't want to do it. 
Kai: 
Damon: 
Kai: Huh. Shame... 
Damon: What are you talking about?
Kai: I have a strong lead on the Ascendant. 
Damon: 
Kai: 
Damon: 
Kai: 
Caroline: Well, that's certainly a look.
Stefan: 
Caroline: You know, you should smile more. You're hot!
Stefan: 
Caroline: And obviously, you're here to babysit me, but I've had less attractive babysitters. Granted, they were old women, and I was eight...
Stefan: I'm not here to babysit you, Caroline.
Caroline: Yes, you are. You, Elena, Bonnie. You don't think that I can live a normal, humanity-less vampire existence without killing anyone, and you feel guilty for being such a royal ass at my mom's funeral.
Stefan: You're right. I was. And then, when I came to apologize and tell you how I really felt, you were gone.
Caroline: And now I don't care.
Stefan: But I do, so let me tell you how I really feel.
Caroline: I said, I don't care.
Stefan: 
Caroline: 
Stefan: I don't know when it became more than friendship, but it did, and it scared me, so I-I pushed it away, but here we are.
Caroline: 
Stefan: That's good. Anger. That means you want to feel.
Caroline: No, Stefan. You know what? It just means that I'm pissed, so leave me alone.
Stefan: Hey, hey. 
Caroline: 
Caroline: Hey, where have you been?
Liam: The bathroom line was, like, a mile long. I mean, look at all these crazy people here--
Caroline: 
Liam: 
Caroline: Perfect! Come with me.
Caroline: There you are. Finally. 
Enzo: 
Caroline: 
Enzo: I'm afraid we found the exception. Told her I was a vampire, and her eyes glazed over... Literally. Pure and utter disinterest.
Enzo: 
Caroline: Stefan's been looking out for Sarah ever since she was a baby, which means he will protect her at any cost.
Enzo: 
Caroline: So, what do you do when you want someone to have nothing to do with vampires?
Enzo: 
Caroline: Thank you. 
Enzo: 
Damon: Hey.
Bonnie: Hey! What are you doing here?
Damon: Don't freak out, but, um...
Kai: Hi.
Damon: 
Kai: Um...
Damon: 
Kai: Um...I wanted...
Bonnie: 
Kai: 
Bonnie: Aah!
Kai: 
Bonnie: Aah!
Kai: 
Kai: Bon, did you hear what I said?
Bonnie: 
Kai: 
Elena: 
Stefan: Hey. It worked.
Elena: 
Stefan: I saw it in her eyes. She's still in there. We just have to find her.
Elena: 
Stefan: Then we find her, we lock her up, and I push until I break through. I can get her back, Elena.
Elena: 
Stefan: 
Caroline: Aw, is someone having a bad night?
Stefan: What are you doing with Enzo's phone?
Caroline: I stole it, but that's not the question that you should be asking right now. You should be asking, "Why does Enzo have Sarah Salvatore's number in his phone?" Or maybe, "Where is Sarah Salvatore?" And ultimately, "What the hell are you going to do to her, Caroline?"
Sarah: Hello? Enzo?
Caroling: 
Sarah: Oh, um, actually, I'm looking for--
Caroline: Enzo, yeah I heard you. He's not here right now, but I am.
Stefan: 
Caroline: 
Damon: Hey. Calm down. It's just me. He's not here. Bonnie, this is about my mom. Kai knows a lot of stuff about my mom--
Bonnie: 
Damon: I know but Bonnie--
Bonnie: 
Damon: He just wanted to talk--
Bonnie: Now I want to talk, so listen
Damon: I get that he hurt you...
Bonnie: 
Damon: Ugh!
Bonnie: I want you to feel what I felt.
Damon: Ow!
Bonnie: You were there the first time he hurt me, an arrow through the stomach. But you weren't there for what happened next, when he chased me through the hospital. 
Damon: 
Bonnie: Sound familiar? He lied, and then he stabbed me again!
Damon: Aagh!
Bonnie: Then came the worst part, because when it was all over, he left me. Alone. 
Damon: 
Bonnie: 
Caroline: Hey! I'm making margaritas. You want one?
Elena: 
Caroline: I see Stefan filled you in on his big secret.
Stefan: Where is she, Caroline?
Caroline: Not here. That would be stupid. 
Liam: Hello!
Caroline: Sarah is helping Liam with his surgical skills.
Sarah: Please, please don't hurt me.
Liam: I don't want to do this!
Caroline: 
Sarah: No! Please! Please!
Stefan: Look, Caroline. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed you.
Caroline: Obviously. I was pretty clear about that.
Elena: Look. I know that you can't feel it right now, Care, but if you kill Sarah, it's gonna haunt you forever. Trust me. I did it, and it sucks.
Caroline: I compelled a student to perform surgery on Stefan's niece, and you found a way to make this about you? God, you truly have a gift, Elena.
Stefan: Look at me, Caroline. What do you want me to do? You want me to leave town, I'll leave town. I'll stay as far away from you as possible. Just please let her go.
Caroline: That's the problem, Stefan. It doesn't really matter how far away you are. You're still you-- kind, loyal, 
Stefan: Killing Sarah isn't gonna change that.
Caroline: I know, that's why I'd rather just change you. Let go of that part of you, Stefan.
Elena: 
Caroline: If Stefan wants to save Sarah's life-- 
Elena: He is not turning his humanity off.
Caroline: 
Stefan: It's not gonna happen, Caroline.
Caroline: 
Sarah: No! Please! No! No!
Caroline: Cut out her spleen.
Elena: 
Caroline: Relax! She can live without a spleen, you know. It's really the infection you should be worried about.
Sarah: Please don't hurt me. No! No! No! NO!
Liam: I'm sorry!
Stefan: Hey, Liam-- remember that conversation we had earlier about being honest? Where are you?
Caroline: Don't answer him, Liam.
Liam: Whitmore Medical.
Caroline: Hey!
Sarah: Please don't hurt me!
Stefan: 
Caroline: 
Sarah: 
Caroline: How's it going, Liam?
Liam: 
Caroline: You know what? I changed my mind. Leave the spleen. 
Sarah: 
Caroline: Take out her heart.
Caroline: Liam, you still with me?
Damon: I'm not in the mood for the preamble-- just tell me why my mom's stuck in 1903.
Kai: 
Damon: That's odd. 
Kai: You requested a truncated version, so I respectfully jumped to the end.
Damon: 
Kai: Because there are only two prison worlds in existence. Mine, created in 1994, and the one created in 1903 for the sole purpose of locking up your mom and her closet full of crazy-pants.
Damon: 
Kai: 
Damon: And I'm telling you, as a vampire who eats people, you really don't want to piss me off.
Kai: I'm trying to save your life.
Damon: Tell me how to get her back!
Kai: Your mom's a Ripper, okay? 
Damon: 
Kai: Bodies piled up, she moved, killed some more, until she had to move again. 
Damon: 
Kai: And, for some reason, my coven made it their duty to stop her. So, they cut her off at New York Harbor before she could tear through Manhattan. Granted-- 
Damon: 
Kai: 
Jeremy: 
Bonnie: Hey, Jeremy, it's Bonnie. It's a really long story, but I'm back. Uh, I had this whole plan to drive out to New Mexico and surprise you... I don't know, show up as one of the models in your drawing class or something. 
Sarah: Aah! No! Please! Liam! Liam, No! Aah!
Liam: 
Sarah: You'll kill me! Liam, I'll die! Liam!
Liam: 
Caroline: You don't realize this, but this really does hurt me to watch. 
Liam: I think she passed out.
Caroline: 
Caroline: 
Elena: 
Caroline: Hey. You're gonna be a doctor, right? How long can one live without their heart? Maybe, like, three seconds tops?
Stefan: She's gonna let her die, Elena.
Elena: I can't find them anywhere. We're running out of time!
Stefan: 
Elena: 
Stefan: 
Elena: No, no, no, no, no, no. Stefan! No! Stefan, no!
Elena: 
Elena: 
Liam: 
Elena: 
Liam: 
Elena: 
Stefan: Hello?
Elena: 
Stefan: Oh, really?
Elena: Stefan, are you okay?
Stefan: Well, I will be in one second. 
Elena: Please don't tell me that you shut it off. 
Stefan: 
Caroline:
