Catch Me If You Can
Into the Wild

Rebekah's House




Klaus: Leaving so soon?




Rebekah: This is my place, Nik, and I don't appreciate you invading my privacy like some kind of creeping Tom.

Klaus: Well, I apologize for breaking up this sordid little tryst, but I do have some urgent business. Or have you forgotten – our paranoid brother Kol is running around with the white oak stake and homicide on the brain?

Rebekah: He tried to kill me last night. I didn't forget.

Klaus: Yes, well, unfortunately he seems to have absconded with my set of daggers.

Rebekah: Oh, poor Nik. How ever will you get your way without your precious daggers? They were so handy when you wanted to end a conversation with one of us!

Klaus: Kol's irrational fear of Silas has pushed him over the edge. We need to put him down before he does any more damage. Now, I know you have the last dagger, and I know you have some white ash, so hand it over.

Rebekah: Mhm, and leave myself unprotected? You can file that request under 'no chance in hell.' Be gone by the time I have showered. Lurkers aren't welcome here.




Klaus: I need that dagger, Stefan. Talk some sense into her.

Stefan: Why don't you talk some sense into her? I'm headed home to play prison guard to Damon. He's on lockdown ever since Kol compelled him to kill Jeremy last night.

Klaus: You see? That's my point exactly. If you let Kol roam free, then Jeremy won't live to see his junior prom, and we can kiss our map to the cure goodbye. But if you help me dagger Kol, Damon will be uncompelled, Jeremy will live, and we'll all be on our merry way to a human Elena.

Mystic Falls High School




Elena: Where are you?

Bonnie: I told Caroline that I'd take her place at decade dance prep, but none of the rest of you showed.




Elena: I know, I'm sorry. I had to, though. I have Jeremy under house arrest because Kol wants to kill him, and Klaus wants to take him on some vampire-slaying road trip. And since neither of them are invited in, it's the only place I can keep them safe.

Bonnie: Why does it sound like you're under fire?

Elena: Apparently I'm living in a fraternity house now.

Jeremy: I'm training.

Matt: Me, too.

Elena: Train yourself to do some dishes, and put these weapons away before someone tries to use one on me.




Bonnie: Well, it's hard for me to look forward to this dance while you're trapped in your house.

Elena: Listen, I have a plan to end all of this. I want Jeremy to kill Kol.

Bonnie: You want Jeremy to kill an original?

Elena: Think about it. Kol's sire line must stretch to the moon by now. If Jeremy kills Kol, every vampire that he's ever turned, not to mention everyone that they've turned, will die, which means the hunter's mark will be complete and we'll have our key to finding the cure.

Bonnie: I'm on my way, we'll figure it out. Do you think Caroline will notice if there's only 89 red balloons?

Elena: 
 Actually, probably yes.




Bonnie: Elena!




Elena: Sorry.

Bonnie: What happened?

Elena: I don't know. There's something in the water.




Bonnie: Are you serious? You dumped vervain into the water supply? Where did you even get it?

Rudy: I have my sources. I'm also reinstating the curfew and canceling all town events.

Bonnie: Dad, there's a dance tonight.

Rudy: Not anymore.

Bonnie: Are you serious?

Rudy: Honey, I'm trying to protect you, not punish you. The well-being of this town is my job now.

Bonnie: No! Dad, it's mine and I've been doing fine without you getting involved!

Rudy: You've been doing fine? Would you like me to read you all the names of the people who have gone missing or died in tragic accidents, in your senior year alone? Head straight home please, we're having a family meeting.




Kol: No one can find the cure if you're too dead to find it.




Salvatore Boarding House




Damon: You coming to snap my neck again? Because I woke up feeling completely un-murderous, and I'm pretty sure that it's safe to set me free.




Damon: Oh man, really? You practically bled me dry. At least spring for a bag or something. I'm thirsty.




Damon: Not exactly what I had in mind.




Klaus: Hello, mate.

Damon: What the hell are you doing here?




Klaus: Babysitting.

Damon: Oh.

Stefan: Give him a vial of blood every couple of hours, so he doesn't desiccate. If he gets too much strength back, or if he just annoys you, bleed him out again.

Damon: Silent treatment, huh? Is that your best shot? 
 He's still pissed at me for sleeping with Elena.

Klaus: You sure about that? 'Cause I saw him trying to sneak out of Rebekah's bed this morning, which would suggest to me that he's moved on.




Damon: Well, well. Looks like my brother ripped out a page of my revenge-sex handbook.

Stefan: Well, why don't you two enjoy your little, uh, villain bonding time? I'll let you know when I get the dagger from Rebekah.




Stefan: Damon's fine. I locked him up with all the creature comforts he deserves.

Elena: That's not why I called. Kol just tried to kill Bonnie.




Stefan: What? Is she okay?

Elena: Yeah, she's just shaken up. She managed to hold him off, but Kol seems pretty intent on murdering everyone who's looking for that cure.

Stefan: Yeah, Klaus has me trying to convince Rebekah to give up her dagger so he can take care of Kol.

Elena: I don't want to just dagger Kol. I want Jeremy to kill him.




Stefan: What did you just say?

Elena: Bonnie has all this crazy new power. She thinks she can hold him long enough for Jeremy to get a clean shot.

Stefan: And then what, huh? Klaus and Rebekah will kill every one of us out of spite. They may be dysfunctional bickering lunatics, but they stick together no matter what.

Elena: That's why you need to find the dagger and use it on Rebekah. She can't come looking for revenge if she's laying in a box.

Stefan: Yeah, I can't do that.

Elena: I know you can't because vampires can't use the dagger, but Matt can. It's not like she doesn't deserve it. And Bonnie thinks that she can get Klaus out of the picture, too, at least temporarily. Once we get this cure, none of this will matter because we can use it against them.

Stefan: All right, fine, but how do you plan to lure Kol in?

Street




Kol: Jeremy Gilbert. Nice to see I'm still on your speed dial, mate. Hey, you want to meet up at the batting cages in Denver?

Elena: Actually, it's Elena Gilbert.

Kol: What a treat. Yeah, I was just thinking of all the clever ways I could have your brother killed, but I'd settle for ripping off his illustrated arm instead.

Elena: I need to talk to you – in person.




Elena: I wanna call a truce, in the name of Silas.




Kol: You want to talk about Silas?

Elena: I'll meet you wherever you want. I'll come to you.

Kol: I'll tell you what. How about I come to you?




Kol: If you want a truce, open the door and invite me in.




Kol: I'm waiting. Let me in and let's talk truce.




Kol: Hello?

Elena: Wouldn't that be kind of stupid to invite you in?




Kol: On the contrary, I can't kill your brother with my own two hands, or I'll suffer the hunter's curse and spend the next 20 years trying to off myself in gruesome ways.




Kol: And I've heard that vervain's back in town, so I can't compel you to kill him either. So I think it's fair to say you're semi-safe, for now.




Jeremy: 
 I'm the only one that can invite him inside.

Kol: He's right, obviously.




Kol: You'd think being alive for over a thousand years would teach me some manners, but I couldn't resist stopping by.

Elena: If I let you in, my brother goes. You're not getting near him.

Kol: Fair enough.




Jeremy: You can come in.




Kol: No gold medals for bravery, I see. You know the thing I love about the modern age is...music, anytime you like.




Kol: So...this is the part where you offer me a drink so we can have a proper chat.




Rebekah's House




Rebekah: The colors, the fabrics...The eighties were just...tragic. You know, I think shoulder pads rival 17th-century puritan smocks for crimes against fashion.

Stefan: Looking for something to wear to the dance?

Rebekah: Aye. Are you asking me to a date?

Stefan: Actually, it was canceled.




Rebekah: So why are you here? Back for more dagger talk?




Stefan: Somebody has some trust issues.

Rebekah: It's called a healthy skepticism. I know you were trying to sneak out this morning. I'm not stupid.

Stefan: Sorry, I'm...I'm still trying to get used to this.

Rebekah: Do you regret it?

Stefan: No.

Rebekah: Do you want it to happen again?

Stefan: Maybe.

Rebekah: Even if I don't give you the dagger?

Stefan: You think that I would sleep with you just to get the dagger?

Rebekah: Don't give me that innocent look. You've done plenty to me in the name of getting what you want. Well, I guess I should pack up these racks. Just another failed attempt at getting to a high school dance.

Stefan: Why do you care so much about a high school dance?

Rebekah: I don't. I was just bored.

Stefan: Right. Well, we can still go, if you want.

Rebekah: Not if it's canceled, we can't.

Stefan: Since when do you care about the rules?

Salvatore Boarding House




Klaus: You know, none of this would be an issue if you'd have just done your job properly. I was perfectly willing to let you train Jeremy.

Damon: No, you weren't. Are you kidding? You got there day two. Do you know how hard it is to get these Xbox brains to focus?

Klaus: And then when I turned a room full of barflies into vampires for him to slaughter, you let Kol kill them.

Damon: Your brother problem, not mine, buddy.

Klaus: And whose bright idea was it to saddle Jeremy with a conscience, hmm?

Damon: Well, we couldn't have him trying to stake Elena in her sleep, now, could we?

Klaus: Ah, yes, for the love of Elena. How is it that she manages to overlook every horrific thing you've ever done? Is it willful ignorance, or perhaps something more pathological?

Damon: Some people are just more capable of forgiveness than others. Bet you score about a negative 500 in that realm.

Klaus: 
 Come on. There must be a secret. It can't just be the sire bond. What is it? Compulsion? Manipulation? 
 What is it you say to her?




Damon: I think this has something to do with a certain blonde vampire. I think you murdered Carol Lockwood, and I think you're worried that Caroline's never going to forgive you.

Klaus: You've done worse.

Damon: Debatable. See, I don't mind being the bad guy, because somebody has to fill that role and get things done. You do bad things for no reason. You do them to be a dick.

Klaus: Debatable.




Damon: If you're gonna be bad, be bad with a purpose. Otherwise, you're just not worth forgiving.




Gilbert Residence




Elena: Sorry, I had to dig up the old people alcohol.




Kol: Yeah, that's the problem with people today. They have no drinking imagination. Turn-of-the-century New Orleans – now, they knew how to make a drink.

Elena: You lived in New Orleans?

Kol: We all did, till Niklaus shoved a dagger in my heart.

Elena: Why? What did you do?

Kol: What makes you think I did anything? Has your alliance with my brother softened you to his horrors?

Elena: I don't have an alliance with Klaus. We had a mutual interest in finding the cure – that's all.

Kol: Had?

Elena: Yes. And I'm willing to give up looking for it if you promise to leave my brother alone. 
 Now, can you teach me how to make this?




Elena: I'll get some ice.




Street




Jeremy: Bonnie, where are you? I called like seventeen times. Kol is in our house. We need you. Okay, I'm heading to your house now.

Gilbert Residence




Elena: Here you go.

Kol: Would you like one?




Elena: Sure, why not?




Elena: You're really good at that game. Definitely considering you've been locked up in a coffin for a hundred years.

Kol: 
 I'm a quick learner. Speedy reflexes. It's not much like the real thing, though, is it? 
 You've killed, haven't you? Or are you one of those Mary Sue vampires?

Elena: I've killed. Once. I'm guessing your number's a lot higher than mine.

Kol: You lose track over the years. So, are we going to talk about Silas, or just jibber-jabber?

[Elena gestures to the family room, and Kol walks over. Elena pulls out her phone. She has a text from Matt saying 'No dagger yet. Need time.'

Rebekah's House




Gilbert Residence




Elena: Nobody else seems to think Silas exists, so why do you?

Kol: I used to run with some witches. Africa in the fourteenth century, Haiti in the seventeenth century, New Orleans in the nineteen hundreds. They all knew about Silas; that he needed to stay buried. I actually hold witches in high esteem.

Elena: Yeah, but why Silas? Why are you so afraid of him?

Kol: They said if Silas rises, he'll unleash hell on Earth. I happen to like Earth just the way it is.

Elena: That's pretty biblical.

Kol: Well, that's the other problem with people today – they've lost faith. And in that loss, they no longer know who they should fear.

Bennett Residence




Bonnie: I have to get to Elena's – have you seen my phone?




Rudy: I've got your phone, and I've got your car keys. And I told you, we are having a family meeting.

Bonnie: Is that something you read in a book? Because we have never had a family meeting.

Rudy: I've let this go on far enough. Shane said you and your magic are like a ticking time bomb.

Bonnie: And I told you he's crazy.

Rudy: I lost your mother to witchcraft. I don't intend to lose you.

Bonnie: It's not your life, it's mine.




Rudy: Yeah?

Jeremy: Is Bonnie here?

Rudy: She's busy.




Jeremy: It's important.




Bonnie: What's going on?

Jeremy: I've called you like a hundred times. Kol is in our house.




Bonnie: I have to go.

Rudy: I said "no".




Bonnie: Stop telling me what to do.




Abby: No one's going anywhere.

Bonnie: Mom?

Rudy: Abby, please come in.




Bonnie: What are you doing here?

Abby: Your father called. Who's professor Shane? What has he been teaching you?

Jeremy: Bonnie, we don't have time for this.

Rudy: This is a family matter.




Jeremy: My sister's in trouble. We need Bonnie's help.

Abby: My daughter is done helping Elena Gilbert. Now, get out!

Bonnie: Mom!

Abby: Answer my question. What lies has this professor been telling you?




Bonnie: Don't! Jeremy! Hey, stop! Stop.




Bonnie: Don't hurt her. She's my mom.




Bonnie: All right? Look at me.




Bonnie: Just go, okay? I'm right behind you.




Bonnie: You wanna talk? Let's talk.

Gilbert Residence




Elena: So we're out of gin, but I think this is a good year.

Kol: What if I said I don't believe you?

Elena: Okay, you caught me. I don't know anything about wine.




Kol: It just seems odd that you'd be so willing to give up something you want so much.

Elena: I would do anything for my brother. And if what you're saying about Silas is true, what does it matter what I want if it puts everyone else in danger?

Kol: Well, this has been enlightening. Thanks for the drinks.




Kol: I'll take your request for a truce under advisement.

Elena: Is there any chance that you could be wrong about Silas?

Kol: Trust me, Elena. Some things are better left buried.




Mystic Falls High School




Rebekah: I think I saw a horror movie that started just like this. Did you know they play movies on TV all night long now? Hundreds of them. So much better than those silly black-and-white picture shows we used to go to.




Stefan: I dunno. I kinda miss the old ones. You got any requests for the DJ?




Rebekah: I'll let you pick. Nothing cheesy.

Stefan: Oh, that leaves out about half the decade.




Stefan: Hope you like The Cure.

Rebekah: Funny. So is everything about the eighties so...excessive?

Stefan: It had its charm. "Say Anything" – Lloyd Dobler standing outside of a bedroom window with a boombox over his head, desperately trying to get back the girl of his dreams; "Princess Bride" – Wesley slays giant rats for love; "The Breakfast Club" – one detention turns a bunch of outcasts into allies.

Rebekah: So it was a decade of sentimental drivel, as well?

Stefan: Well, I was going to say love, friendship, the possibility of anything happening. You would've loved it.

Rebekah: 
 And why is that?

Stefan: Because as much as we both hate to admit it, we care about those things.




Rebekah: That better not be a corsage. I loathe corsages.




Stefan: These were all the rage in the eighties.




Stefan: Let's dance.




Gilbert Residence




Elena: I'm sorry. He left. I mean, I – I tried to stall as long as I could.




Jeremy: That's Bonnie. She was right behind me.




Kol: I've considered your request for a truce. Request denied.




Kol: 
 I'm sorry. I've already been invited in!




Kol: Hide and seek? Fine by me.

Bennett Residence

Bonnie: Dad needs to mind his own business. He had no right to call you here.

Abby: It's not just your father, Bonnie. Witches talk; word gets around.

Bonnie: I found a new way to practice. It's unconventional, but I can handle myself, I promise.

Rudy: That's not what Shane said.

Bonnie: Shane is sitting in a jail cell right now. You're going to take his word over mine?

Abby: I have warned you about dark magic before.

Bonnie: It's not dark magic, it's Expression and I need it! We found a cure, Mom. There's a cure for vampirism. And I can do the spell to access it. I can save you, but I have to go – now.

Abby: I'm not the one that needs to be saved. You are.




Salvatore Boarding House




Klaus: Your brother's lack of communication is infuriating.

Damon: It's one of his trademarks, like his brooding and his hair.

Klaus: I don't understand what's taking so long. I mean, how hard is it to steal a dagger?

Damon: From a vampire who's been stabbed as many times as your sister, I'd say difficult.




Damon: Sweet.

Klaus: You disappoint me, Damon. You're not trying very hard to get out of here. I expected more the daring escape artist, less the cell potato.

Damon: Well, I am compelled to kill Jeremy, so I figured it's probably smarter to sit here and chit-chat with you than bust out of here like the Hulk.

Klaus: How do you think Elena felt about that, by the way? Your inability to overcome Kol's compulsion for a single moment even though it meant saving the person she loves most in the world?

Damon: She's met me. She knows impulse control's not my strong suit.

Klaus: Still, must be hard trying to live up to Stefan. I remember when I compelled him to feed off Elena. He fought it so hard, he actually managed to resist. Now, that's love.

Damon: What do you know about love?

Klaus: I know that you're in love with Elena. But I think you're afraid of what might happen when we find the cure at the end of the rainbow. Personally, I don't see a fairytale ending for you. All I see is Stefan and Elena. I think you see the same thing.




Klaus: Well, if it isn't the happy homicidal maniac.

Kol: Did you know that your darling former blood bag and her brother are trying to kill me?

Klaus: What?

Kol: Don't pretend like you're not in on it. Your obsession to find the cure clearly trumps any sibling loyalty you once felt.

Klaus: I don't know what you're talking about.

Kol: I'm going to rip off Jeremy's arm and kill Elena just for sport. Then I'm coming for you.

Gilbert Residence




Salvatore Boarding House




Klaus: What the hell's going on?

Damon: I don't know.

Klaus: What are Stefan and Elena planning?

Damon: I don't know. I've been stuck in the penalty box with you since yesterday. Stefan won't talk to me, and Elena won't come to see me, so maybe you're right. Maybe she's written me off.




Klaus: Tell me what you know.

Damon: I don't know anything about a plan.

Klaus: Stay here till I return.




Damon: I will stay here until you return...




Damon: ...or not.




Mystic Falls High School




Stefan: It's amazing what you can find stashed away in the teachers' lounge.

Rebekah: This song is not as terrible as the other ones.

Stefan: This song is the godfather of rock anthems, okay?

Rebekah: What's going on with you? You're...fun tonight.

Stefan: I can't listen to this music without thinking of my best friend, Lexi. We spent most of the eighties together. I remember this one time she snuck us backstage and compelled half the band to do tequila shots with us before the show. She was fearless, kinda like you.

Rebekah: So, you slept with her, too?

Stefan: No, it wasn't like that. I was just a better person when I was with her. I didn't think I'd ever feel that way again.

Rebekah: Until Elena?

Stefan: Until Elena. And now, that's over.

Rebekah: That look right there? That is why I don't let myself care.

Stefan: Well, you can say that, but we both know it's not true.




Rebekah: Don't worry. I'll protect you if Kol tracks his way to this abandoned dance.




Rebekah: I think I'll choose the next song.




Stefan: No, you know what? I have a better idea.




Stefan: That way.




Rebekah: Well, are you coming?




Gilbert Residence




Kol: Missed!




Elena: 
 Go!




Kol: Now...about that arm.




Mystic Falls High School




Stefan: Like that.




Rebekah: This is ridiculous.

Stefan: Well, that's the whole point of The Breakfast Club slide. It's supposed to be ridiculous.




Stefan: No, that's – that's cheating.

Rebekah: What is fun about hurtling down a hallway like a teenage imbecile?

Stefan: You're just gonna have to do it to find out.




Stefan: All right, it's the shoes. Take off the shoes, you'll be fine, okay?




Rebekah: This is what you want, right?




Rebekah: Go ahead, take it. You're right. I do care. I want stupid koala corsages and a prom. I want to have kids with someone who loves me enough to stand outside my window with a stupid boombox. I want to be human. So let Klaus put down my brother. Let's go find the cure.




Stefan: Come on. Let's go home.




Bennett Residence




Rudy: You're drugging her?

Abby: Just enough to keep her down until I can get some witches here to clean her mind from that poison that professor's been teaching her.

Bonnie: That's not happening.




Abby: Bonnie, please.




Bonnie: I don't belong to the spirits anymore. I belong to myself. Sorry.




Gilbert Residence




Kol: Now, like I said, I don't fancy the hunter's curse, so I'm just going to chop off your arm. But don't worry, I'll heal you right up with a bit of blood after.




Kol: Sorry about the sting. Now, which arm is it? Is it left or right? I'll just chop off both to be safe.




Elena: Jeremy, now!




Klaus: What did you do?

Elena: We didn't have a choice. He was trying to cut off Jeremy's arm!

Klaus: Lies! He never would've gotten inside if you hadn't have set a trap for him.

Elena: You said you were going to put him down too.

Klaus: 
 I was going to make him suffer on my terms! I'm going to burn this house to the ground. And then, when you try to flee for your lives, I'll kill you both without blinking.

Jeremy: You kill us, you'll never get to the cure. You'll never be able to make any more hybrids.

Klaus: You really think I care for an instant about my bloody hybrids? I want the cure so I can destoy it. I would've killed you all the second we dug it up, but now I'm just gonna watch you burn instead.




Bonnie: Invite him in.




Bonnie: Do it!




Jeremy: Come in.




Bonnie: Living room. Go!




Klaus: Witch, you can't do this to me.

Bonnie: You have no idea what I can do now.

Klaus: I will hunt all of you to your end! Do you hear me? Do you!?




Rebekah's House




Rebekah: I don't believe you. Kol's not dead. He can't be.

Stefan: Listen, Rebekah, they didn't have a choice. Kol started this when he went after Jeremy. He went after you too, do you remember? I mean, he was never going to let us find the cure.

Rebekah: So you knew? This whole night, you knew?

Stefan: I'm not gonna let the people that I care about get hurt. Not Jeremy, not Elena, not even Damon. And you can hate me for it, but now he can't hurt you, either. And I want us to find this cure together, you and me. Not just for Elena, but for you. So that you can have what you want, be what you want. Be human again. Everyone deserves a second chance, right?

Rebekah: Why would I trust you?

Stefan: I don't know. I guess I could give you my word, but at the end of the day, you just need to take a leap.

Salvatore Boarding House




Jeremy: It didn't work.

Bonnie: It took time for Finn's line to die off, remember? It'll work.

Jeremy: What if it doesn't?

Damon: Where's that Gilbert optimism?




Damon: Hi.




Damon: Sorry I missed all the excitement.

Elena: I'm just happy to see you.




Stefan: Looks like I didn't miss much. Got the Silas headstone.

Elena: We're just waiting for Jeremy's mark to grow.




Elena: Klaus is trapped in our living room.

Bonnie: Temporarily. I drew on the new moon to bind the spell. We've got three days to find that cure – four, max.

Jeremy: If we don't, we might as well look up Katherine Pierce and see if she wants some company in hiding, 'cause he will come after us.

Elena: We'll find it. Now that we've got Rebekah taken care of, all we need is professor Shane, and then we'll have everything we need.

Stefan: Yeah, I didn't, uh...I didn't dagger her.

Elena: What? Why not?

Stefan: I didn't need to. She's on our side.

Elena: On our side? Did you really just say that?

Stefan: Yeah, she handed over the headstone. I mean, she wants to find this cure more than any of us.

Elena: Why would you possibly think that we could trust her?

Damon: Let me guess, she pledged her allegiance to you while you were naked in the sack?




Stefan: I bet you were just dying to get that out, weren't you, Damon?

Damon: Oh, was that supposed to be a secret? Maybe you should have made that a little clear while you were bleeding me dry in our cellar.

Stefan: Yeah, to keep you from killing Jeremy.

Elena: Stop it, both of you.

Stefan: Now, why don't you tell her to calm down, Damon? You've managed to use that sire bond pretty well so far, haven't you?




Jeremy: It's happening.




Elena: Oh, my god...

Jeremy: You can see it?




Damon: Here we go.
