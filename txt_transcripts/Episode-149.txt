RAYNA: Sun's coming up, Stefan. Make your choice.
DAMON: It's a pretty big deal, you know? Me offering to take this scar from you? But, hey, I've been on the bench for quite a while, and you look pretty tired. So, let me tap in and give you a breather! Hashtag "you're welcome." Are hashtags still a thing? I don't know, it's been three years...
RAYNA: Say yes, Stefan. You can stop running. You'll get your life back.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Hallelujah, he's seen the light. Now, I'm just gonna loosen these love-knots a little bit, just to get his phone.
RAYNA: Make sure he behaves.
STEFAN: You okay?
DAMON: Brother, I'm so full of werewolf toxin, I can't even feel my face. A little vervain's not gonna hurt me now.
RAYNA: 
DAMON: Don't worry about Stefan. I'm just giving him a head-start.
VALERIE: See? Now I'm in St. Petersburg! Red pin, I'm in Malaysia. Red pin... Oh, dear. I've landed in the ocean.
VALERIE: They do sell liquor elsewhere, you know. It's best to travel light.
STEFAN: Yeah, but... it's my favorite kind. I'm wondering how many more of these I can have, now that I'm on a time limit...
VALERIE: No time limits here. The night is young, my friend.
STEFAN: I'm not talking about tonight. I did the math. Rayna Cruz won't live forever, therefore neither will I. So, tick-tock.
VALERIE: And you've found mortality doesn't trouble you?
STEFAN: No, actually. Funny thing is, it makes me feel human again, like every minute counts.
VALERIE: Then... let's think of it as an adventure!
STEFAN: Right now?
VALERIE: Damon's gone. You have no one waiting at home anymore. I have no one, either. Why not just follow where the red pins lead?
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: While we search for a way to get rid of your scar. We could trace Rayna's bloodline back to wherever her ancestors come from. Start searching for answers there. But best-case scenario, we save your life. Worst case? We have a long vacation. Everyone you know has made the choice that serves them best. Why not make a choice that serves you?
STEFAN: 
ALEX: Three years with us, and you still haven't learned to sit quietly. Do you like the change in scenery?
NORA: 
ALEX: We need your help.
NORA: 
ALEX: Oh, I don't think that's true, because we have something you want-- answers about the research we've been doing with your girlfriend.
NORA: I'll do anything. Just... name your price.
ALEX: The price is a name, actually. Lorenzo St. John.
NORA: 
ALEX: So I can kill him myself.
NORA: Not that I'm not grateful for the chance to get some air, but what exactly am I doing?
ALEX: I believe Enzo released Rayna Cruz. Why? I have no idea. Why does Enzo do anything lately? But I have learned over time that if I can't trust my family, I certainly can't trust my usual team. And that's where you come in.
ALEX: You can be the one to hunt him down.
NORA: 
ALEX: 
NORA: Are you all right?
LOUISE: Just... just feeling cold.
NORA: Who could blame you in this horrid, damp basement? Every day, I dream I'll carry you away from this place, leaving a trail of gutted corpses in our wake.
LOUISE: You seem quite yourself.
NORA: What happened?
LOUISE: 
LOUISE: Made from Rayna's blood. It's poisonous to witches.
ALEX: Bring Enzo back to me, alive, and I'll give you everything I have to heal her.
LOUISE: 
NORA: 
MATT: Hey, Martel. What's up? I got your text. I owe you for calling off the alert on the whole hostage hoax, so whatever you want, man.
ENZO: All he wants is to cooperate with me. I compelled him to summon you here while remaining silent and calm.
ENZO: Detective, cuff yourself to the car.
ENZO: So, by now, I'm sure Alex has decided that I'm the one who let Rayna escape, which, of course, is untrue.
ENZO: But what I've yet to understand is... why did you release Rayna Cruz?
STEFAN: So, Damon said he could take my scar through a transfer spell. Does that make any sense to you?
VALERIE: He must have been desperate to come up with that idea.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: I suppose fate has a sense of humor...
VALERIE: Taxi's here. I better go.
STEFAN: Hey, be careful, okay?
VALERIE: 
DAMON: Oh, you stayed to keep me company. How sweet.
RAYNA: Nice try. Once I'm done patching myself up, I'm out of here... Because as much as I'd like to kill you first, my sword is on the move, and so is my target. I have to chase them both. My mystical nature calls.
RAYNA: So weird, how Stefan ran away from your offer...
DAMON: 
DAMON: As soon as I charge this, I'll call him. Tell him to get his ass back here. We'll do the transfer spell.
RAYNA: 
DAMON: 
RAYNA: Look at my arm. What do you see?
DAMON: 
RAYNA: I'm made up of regular flesh and bone. My body's 100% human. Even if I stay in good health, in sixty to seventy years, I'll toddle off to the big news station in the sky... Which means right around the time Elena wakes up, I'll be dead. So will you.
RAYNA: Because if I die, you'll die. But I'm sure you already figured out that when you take the scar, you'll be giving up your future with Elena. You'll never see her again. A hero move. Nice.
RAYNA: Okay. Gotta go.
VALERIE: We are looking for ways to get rid of a mystical scar.
STEFAN: That's right. It links me to a crazy woman.
VALERIE: No me. No, we're not linked.
STEFAN: Oh, no, no, no. We're just friends. And she's not crazy. Well... not in a bad way.
VALERIE: Yeah, you've gone off topic...
VALERIE: Now you've made her uncomfortable.
STEFAN: I haven't made her uncomfortable! She doesn't understand what we're saying. Nobody here has any idea what we're saying.
VALERIE: Well, here's to our one-year anniversary of chasing red pins around the world.
STEFAN: Yeah. One year of complete and total failure.
VALERIE: Hey! It's not complete failure. While we have no solved your scar situation yet, we have discovered an astonishing variety of tropical alcohols.
VALERIE: I'm afraid he can't come to the phone right now.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: I brought up how long it's been. Sorry.
STEFAN: No, it's okay. I know what day it is. I've actually been thinking about it quite a bit.
VALERIE: And...?
STEFAN: And I realized that by the time he wakes up, I will probably be dead. So, uh, no... Never gonna call him again.
VALERIE: ...And, likewise, he will never call you.
STEFAN: So, guess that makes this... obsolete.
VALERIE: So... cheers, then?
STEFAN: Cheers.
VALERIE: Mmm. My turn to order.
VALERIE: Um, one more?
BARTENDER: I understand. I also understood what you were saying over there. I think I know how to help.
STEFAN: Caroline?
RAYNA: No such luck. Just me. I took Caroline's work cell, which you kept calling the other day. Wanted to check in on you.
STEFAN: 
RAYNA: Don't hang up. There's still time for me to help you.
STEFAN: 
RAYNA: You took my sword, genius. I need to get it back. If you didn't want to get chased, you should've stayed put at the news station.
STEFAN: And let you kill my brother? Not likely.
RAYNA: So you'd rather be first in line to go?
STEFAN: See, now I'm confused. I thought you were trying to give me a pass?
RAYNA: I was... In my own way. This is going to sound strange, but... you grew on me while I was trapped in the Armory.
RAYNA: You were the only distraction from my routine. Every day, while they were taking my blood and using it for their "research," I'd close my eyes and watch you. I could see where you were, what you were doing...
RAYNA: I saw you travel the world with Valerie.
STEFAN: 
RAYNA: I always know what my targets are up to. That mark on your chest? It's not just a scar, it's a... mystical connection. To me.
STEFAN: 
RAYNA: 
STEFAN: You did just say you spent the last three years spying on me...
RAYNA: The Armory doesn't have TV. What else was I gonna do?
STEFAN: Well, this isn't creepy at all.
RAYNA: The point is, I know exactly where you are and what you're doing now. You're leading me to the Armory. You're hoping they'll provide an assist. But Virginia's a long drive from here-- unless your car runs on something other than gas, you're not gonna make it there before I catch you.
RAYNA: I'm gaining on you. I can tell.
RAYNA: Really???
DAMON: Oh... I'm coming...
DAMON: Hello, KQ... something, something... My vision's gone blurry. Oh...
STEFAN: Hey.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Had to stop for gas.
DAMON: I was expecting a much cooler answer, but...
STEFAN: Yeah, well, I didn't really have much of a choice. Ditched the sword to buy myself a little bit of time. I could really use a great idea for what to do next.
DAMON: Sorry, little fuzzy. You know, toxin fever and all.
STEFAN: Valerie's coming to fix that.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: ...Our friendship evolved.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: H-head back to the station. I'll find you a place to lead Rayna.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
MATT: Why are you even in Dallas?
ENZO: I'm here for work. Everyone's looking for Rayna, of course. The Armory sent an alert when she escaped. I knew she'd used Caroline to set a trap for Stefan, so I wasn't surprised by the hostage broadcast. But I did grow curious when the police failed to respond. I discovered that you convinced them the whole thing was a hoax. Now, why would you do that?
ENZO: I reckoned you wouldn't talk, even if I tortured you. So, I'm going to torture him instead.
MATT: 
ENZO: 
MATT: 
ENZO: 
NORA: 
NORA: Get off me!
NORA: 
ENZO: Fast-acting stuff, isn't it? That does will keep you quiet for an hour or so.
NORA: Your toy got away.
ENZO: 
NORA: Well, lucky for you, I'm weak with hunger. Haven't had a proper meal in three bloody years.
NORA: NO! NO!
ENZO: 
NORA: I'm attached to being alive! Those pills are what poisoned Mary Lou!
ENZO: 
NORA: I was promised an antidote in return for your capture.
ENZO: Who promised you?
NORA: Alex. She said you released Rayna.
ENZO: Incorrect. I'm guessing she only told you that to motivate you.
NORA: My only motivation is Mary Louise! She's all I have in this world, and I will not let her die!
NORA: 
ENZO: 
NORA: I don't want one!
ENZO: Listen to me! If those pills are fatal to witches, then you and I need to work together.
NORA: Why should I trust you?
ENZO: Because I care about this as much as you do. I swear it on my life.
RAYNA: You owe some guy a cube truck.
STEFAN: 
RAYNA: 
STEFAN: You don't know anything about me.
RAYNA: Mystical connection, remember? Anyway, I don't blame you for doubting Damon. You always knew having him in your orbit might get you killed someday.
STEFAN: 
RAYNA: 
RAYNA: That doesn't mean I like it. I actually think you're an okay person, despite what Matt thinks. That guy really hates you.
STEFAN: 
RAYNA: He wouldn't let me out of my cell until I promised to put you back in the hell stone. Ouch. Want to talk about it?
STEFAN: 
ENZO: Damon Salvatore. A voice from the great beyond!
DAMON: Well, if "the great beyond" is in Dallas, then... yep.
ENZO: You sound a bit worse for wear, mate.
DAMON: Me? Never better. Listen, are you still friends with those nutjobs at the Armory?
ENZO: 
ENZO: Why? What do you need?
DAMON: I need to set up a meet. Stefan's got Rayna Cruz on his tail, and he needs to come in for a landing.
ENZO: Oh, I know just the spot! Literally.
ENZO: The Armory uses an airfield near Dallas. I'll text you and Stefan the coordinates for the hostage exchange.
DAMON: I'm loving your James Bond vibe.
ENZO: 
DAMON: There you are.
NORA: "Hostage exchange?"
ENZO: 
NORA: Oh, don't be absurd! She wants me to bring you back to the Armory.
ENZO: 
ENZO: Unless you're eager for captivity or death, I advise you to do this my way.
NORA: 
ENZO: Luring Rayna to the air strip makes it worth Alex's while to come out into the open. I'll tell her to bring Mary Louise, but leave her lackeys behind. Did Alex give you a phone to use?
ENZO: Cheers.
NORA: Why are you helping me?
ENZO: Let's just say I prefer the direct approach.
LOUISE: "Come live with me and be my love / And we will all the pleasures prove / No valleys, groves, hills and fields / Woods or steepy mountain yields..."
ALEX: Don't let me stop the poetry.
LOUISE: 
ALEX: Free-styling?
LOUISE: It's one of Nora's favorite poems. She used to read it to me daily.
ALEX: 
LOUISE: 
ALEX: 
DAMON: Rayna.
DAMON: You gonna kick me in the face again?
VALERIE: 
DAMON: Now I know why Stefan digs you. You're a take-charge kind of gal.
VALERIE: 
DAMON: Oh, slightly domineering-- also Stefan's type.
DAMON: Wow. Much better.
VALERIE: I had to get you healthy so we can do the transfer spell.
DAMON: Yeah, about that...
VALERIE: There you are--
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: The bartender has a theory...
STEFAN: Of course he does. If there's one thing we've learned from our travels all over the world, it's that every bartender has a theory, and every one of them is wrong. Now... look up.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: At the sky.
STEFAN: Come on! Just humor me. Live in the moment. That's what we're here for, right?
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: Ooh, yeah. Lovely stars.
STEFAN: Yeah.
VALERIE: Mmmm.
STEFAN: They're bigger this close to the equator.
VALERIE: They're the same as I've seen from every place else. There's Orion, Cassiopeia...
STEFAN: Cassiopeia is my favorite. Voice of doom. Saw the truth when no one else did.
VALERIE: You're thinking of Cassandra. She doesn't have a constellation.
STEFAN: No, no, no, no. The constellation's Cassiopeia, that's what I'm saying!
VALERIE: No, it's not.
STEFAN: Yeah, it is! You know why? Because I said so.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: You're right. I am.
STEFAN: 
ALEX: Who are you?
NORA: Nobody important.
NORA: 
NORA: As requested.
ENZO: And as promised, here I am.
NORA: Where's Mary Louise?
ALEX: Resting in the office.
NORA: I hope you remember how to drive.
ENZO: What about the antidote?
ALEX: 
NORA: 
ALEX: I said I'd give you everything I know about the pills. Here's what I know-- we tried to create the antidote, and we failed.
ENZO: 
ALEX: Meanwhile, Mary Louise will be dead within the week.
NORA: I'll tear your throat out!
ENZO: NO! I need her first.
ALEX: You can stay here and yell at me if you want, but then I might not give you a car. I suggest you go make the most of the time your girlfriend has left.
ENZO: For your sake, I hope you're lying.
ALEX: Why so interested in the pills? They're only really useful if you want to fight a witch... or hide from a locator spell.
ENZO: 
ALEX: I know you've been raiding the Armory's supplies. Figured it out after Rayna's escape. But why did you steal so many pills? Who could you have been giving them to?
ENZO: I haven't stolen anything, all right? Seems to me you've just lost track of your possessions.
ALEX: 
ALEX: We're family, so you know I'm not an idiot. Give Bonnie Bennett my regards.
DAMON: 
VALERIE: 
DAMON: I put a little spin on your plan.
VALERIE: 
DAMON: 
VALERIE: Your suggestion was news to me.
DAMON: Not what I asked. How long have you known the answer? For example-- my thinking was, "Hey, the transfer spell worked on Ric's babies. Maybe it'll work on the scar." Three years go by, and that little concept never crossed your mind? If I was a betting man-- which I am-- I would bet that you knew about the spell all along. And rather than sharing it with my brother, you lied to him.
VALERIE: I never lied to him.
DAMON: But you didn't tell him the truth either, did you? Because you didn't want to get rid of that scar. Because without his scar to keep him running, he could've gone back to Caroline. How insecure could you possibly be?
VALERIE: All right, I lied. But I wasn't protecting myself, I was protecting him.
DAMON: By risking his life??
VALERIE: By keeping you out of it! The Phoenix Scar requires a special kind of transfer. It can only go to a blood relative, and that would've meant waking you and bringing you and all the drama that you come with back into his life-- a life which he was finally thriving in without you.
DAMON: I get it. You think I'm a piece of crap. And by the way, I was. Before. And then I met a girl, and she made me good. And that's why I need Elena in my life. And when I get her back in my life, I will be there for Stefan.
VALERIE: The only person you ever needed was by your side all along, and you abandoned him. So, I took your place. I took Caroline's place. I've been everything to him.
DAMON: Sounds more like he was everything to you. I'll take that.
DAMON: Hold tight, brother. This vintage beast only goes so fast.
VALERIE: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
VALERIE: Yeah, by kidnapping me instead of doing the spell.
DAMON: I needed you for backup. I didn't have time to argue. Shut up.
STEFAN: 
VALERIE: Stefan?
DAMON: We are still gonna save you. The calvary's coming to you, brother. We're gonna take down Rayna. You're gonna get your freedom, and I'm still gonna get my future.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Relax! I have a good plan.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Stefan, listen--
STEFAN: Say it! I want to hear you say it. You're not taking the scar.
DAMON: I have a plan!
STEFAN: You always do.
VALERIE: He should've never trusted you.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: All right, can we just stay focused here? How far--
DAMON: 
RAYNA: I'll catch you later.
VALERIE: We're too late! We're too late because of you!
DAMON: No. No, we'll be there in ten minutes.
VALERIE: You're clinging to the coward's way out. This is exactly why Stefan ran.
DAMON: I thought Stefan ran to save me from Rayna?
VALERIE: He ran because he knew that when the moment came, you'd let him down and choose yourself. In his heart of hearts, that's what he thinks of you, and he's right. Now is when you prove who you really are.
DAMON: 
VALERIE: We have to pull over--
DAMON: 
NORA: Mary Lou? Mary Lou, it's me.
LOUISE: 
NORA: How are you feeling?
LOUISE: Awful. I've been poisoned.
NORA: 
LOUISE: You are... a terrible liar.
LOUISE: Nora, I'm dying. There is no antidote. Alex told me.
NORA: Well, I don't care what she says. We'll find a way-- together.
LOUISE: You're driving? I've got even less time on earth than I thought...
NORA: 
DAMON: Come on.
VALERIE: You never should have sent him there to meet her.
DAMON: 
VALERIE: 
RAYNA: I want to finish our conversation.
STEFAN: 
RAYNA: It hurts me to see you like this, Stefan. I mean, it really hurts me. Because of our connection, I can feel what my targets feel. Like when Matt set me free at the Armory. As soon as I touched my sword, I felt what it did to you.
RAYNA: 
RAYNA: Not Valerie, not even Caroline-- you wanted Damon.
RAYNA: 
STEFAN: Damon, wake the hell up!
RAYNA: 
STEFAN: My scar opened up this morning. I figured she was back. I didn't realize she was this close.
RAYNA: You almost gave me time to catch you. You just had to have Damon along for the ride again. Those three years he was in the coffin? Guess that was all the enjoyment you could take.
STEFAN: I didn't enjoy being a fugitive.
RAYNA: 
VALERIE: 
RAYNA: You can see the cause and effect, right? You can see that you're in this bind because of the dumbass mistake you made waking Damon up?
STEFAN: Why do you care about my mistakes?
RAYNA: It's not me who cares. It's the Phoenix Stone. Its voice is in my head all the time. You have no idea how loud it is. It wants me to liberate you, Stefan. It is still trying to show you-- the only way for you to be free is to let Damon go.
RAYNA: You've ignored its wisdom before. Are you finally ready to leave Damon behind? Did today convince you?
STEFAN: Yes.
RAYNA: Now, remember that... and use it to survive in the hell stone this time.
VALERIE: 
VALERIE: Uh, something's wrong.
DAMON: Wait, why's it going away?
VALERIE: The spell's unraveling... There's no scar to transfer.
DAMON: 
CAROLINE: 
MATT: I did it.
MATT: I made Stefan pay for what he did.
MATT: Just like I promised you.
NORA: Right. No more gloomy talk now. First thing we'll do is get you a decent meal. Something plump and juicy from the suburbs.
LOUISE: Nothing too decadent.
LOUISE: I'm trying to maintain my charms.
NORA: To my eyes, you are perfect.
DAMON: No...
VALERIE: Stefan!
DAMON: Stefan, no! Hey. Stefan!
: We can bring him back. We've done it before.
DAMON: Where's the damn sword? Where's the sword?
LOUISE: That was an amazing escape! I take back all my insults about your driving.
NORA: 
LOUISE: 
LOUISE: 
NORA: No time for gloomy talk. I've been marked by Rayna Cruz, and I'll be running from her for as long as I live.
LOUISE: 
NORA: No! What are you doing?
LOUISE: One good thing with the strength I have left.
LOUISE: 
NORA: 
LOUISE: I will not let her put you in this hell stone!
NORA: If you don't stop, you will die!
LOUISE: I'm already dead, my love.
VALERIE: It's my fault.
DAMON: No, this is all on me. I tried to have it all. Next time, it'll be different.
LOUISE: Nora, don't! You must live!
NORA: 
NORA: "Come live with me..."
LOUISE: 
NORA: "...And be my love..."
LOUISE: 
NORA: "And we will all the pleasures prove, that Valleys, groves..."
DAMON: Everything will be okay, Stefan. I'll get that stone, and we'll make this right.
NORA: "...Hills and fields, Woods or steepy mountains yield..."
LOUISE: 
NORA: "...And we will sit upon the Rocks..."
LOUISE: 
NORA: "...Seeing the Shepherds feed their flocks..."
NORA: "And I will make the beds of Roses..."
NORA: I love you.
LOUISE: I love you.
RAYNA: AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
RAYNA: NOOOOOO!
DAMON: I'm gonna save you, little brother. I promise. I promise you.
