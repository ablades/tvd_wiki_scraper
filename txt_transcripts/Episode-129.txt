BARTENDER: 
BARTENDER: 
STEFAN: Boo!
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Boo!
CAROLINE: 
BARTENDER: 
CAROLINE: Oh! I'm Caroline-- 
STEFAN: 
BARTENDER: ...What's going on?
STEFAN: Well, Caroline and I had a little bet that she would scare you to death.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: But, you have to understand-- this is her first time messing with somebody, so she didn't realize the whole "dead body shock-drop"-thing is a complete cliché.
BARTENDER: 
CAROLINE: Well, then why aren't you freaking out? A panic attack? A heart attack? Come on, give me something.
CAROLINE: 
BARTENDER: 
STEFAN: 
BARTENDER: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: Oh, my God! Are those spiders all over your body?
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: A win is a win. So, you know what we do now?
STEFAN: 
SARAH: So, you drag me out of a hospital bed, waste a tank of gas driving around all night, just to bring me to a house in the middle of nowhere?
ENZO: 
SARAH: When have I ever been your problem?
ENZO: Since your great-great-great uncle Stefan nearly got you killed.
SARAH: 
ENZO: It's time for you to meet your real family.
LILY: Hello. Are you looking for my son?
ENZO: 
LILY: I'm sorry, have... have we--
ENZO: 
SARAH: What the hell was that?
ENZO: I've met that woman before, in 1903.
SARAH: 
ENZO: She's the one who turned me into a vampire.
ELENA: Do you smell something?
DAMON: 
ELENA: Is that bacon?
DAMON: Yeah, or some baby she abducted from a nearby village.
ELENA: 
DAMON: No, she is a tool to get Stefan's humanity back, because there is no doubt that he and Caroline are fangs-deep in bodies right now. So, the sooner we get our supernatural-born killers out of circulation, the better.
ELENA: Have you seen my t-shirt?
DAMON: 
ELENA: I'm not so sure your mom would feel the same way.
DAMON: 
ELENA: Wow!
LILY: 
DAMON: 
LILY: Well, you were human the last time you tasted it! Our tastes change over time. But, Elena, you're fairly new at this, aren't you?
ELENA: 
LILY: You ever miss it? Being human?
ELENA: 
LILY: So, if I understood correctly, um, in order to free my companions from that place where I was trapped, we'll need the magical device.
DAMON: The Ascendant.
LILY: Yes. The Ascendant. Where is that?
DAMON: 
LILY: And we'll also need a celestial event.
DAMON: We'll have to do some digging, yeah. Be patient, they take time. They're very rare.
LILY: There's a full moon coming up. Will that work? If not, the Lyrids meteor shower is in two weeks.
DAMON: 
LILY: Actually, I took your advice, and I've been dabbling on Stefan's computer. What a wondrous invention! All that knowledge.
DAMON: And videos of cats riding robot vacuum cleaners.
DAMON: 
ELENA: It's Jo. Someone's been attacking people at Whitmore.
DAMON: 
ELENA: That's exactly what I'm gonna find out. 
SARAH: Who was that woman, and how do you even know who my family is? How do I not know this?
ENZO: Because your uncle Stefan compelled you to forget to keep you a secret from your other uncle, Damon, after he killed your parents. And, you would have shared their fate had it not been for your other uncle.
SARAH: 
ENZO: Well, actually, no-- The good brother recently went bad, and I was hoping to leave you in the care of the bad brother, who actually is less bad now than the good brother.
SARAH: 
ENZO: Yeah, look-- I can try repeating it, love, but it won't be any clearer the second time. 
DOCKWORKER: No sick passengers!
ENZO: I have a ticket. I've paid!
DOCKWORKER: 
ENZO: 
DOCKWORKER: 
ENZO: 
LILY: Someone who sees you need a doctor.
ENZO: 
LILY: I can be of some help with that. Come. We don't have much time.
ENZO: 
ENZO: 
SARAH: Or, you're finally gonna tell me the whole story.
ENZO: 
SARAH: Yeah. Your friend Matt stopped by the hospital and gave me some.
ENZO: UNGH!
STUDENT: Hey! Taylor Swift! We're trying to study here! 
STEFAN: Someone ask for the manager?
TYLER: 
MATT: Guy was out for twenty seconds!
TYLER: 
MATT: 
TYLER: 
MATT: 
TYLER: 
STEFAN: Oh, look! It's the police officers in training. Are you guys here to arrest us? 
TYLER: 
STEFAN: I'm just enjoying the music. You guys want next song?
MATT: We should get out of here.
STEFAN: No, stay! Caroline's taking requests.
DAMON: Here. Text Elena. Tell her we're headed to campus to check it out. 
LILY: Oh! You're right.
DAMON: Mmhmm.
LILY: "Dearest Elena, I hope this finds you well..."
DAMON: No, no, no, no-- short and sweet. Just "Headed to campus." 
LILY: 
DAMON: Exactly.
LILY: And once we've done that, then we will go rescue my friends?
DAMON: Sure. I know how terribly concerned you are about that.
LILY: 
DAMON: Knock yourself out.
LILY: You do love her, don't you?
DAMON: Not that that's any of your business, but yes, I do. And she loves me. We're in the love.
LILY: 
DAMON: You spied on me?
LILY: Well, I didn't mean to eavesdrop, I'm just not used to hearing other voices. I...
DAMON: 
LILY: I couldn't help but listen. And, it's not every day that one hears something so rare as a cure for vampirism.
DAMON: 
LILY: You mean, don't bring it up with Elena.
DAMON: I don't even know if she wants the cure.
LILY: But you fear she might, and that if you give it to her, you'll lose her. 
ELENA: He's unconscious, but I gave him some of my blood, and his vitals have stabilized.
JO: 
ELENA: Yeah, I know. That's why I'm hoping that Damon and his mom find them soon.
JO: 
ELENA: 
JO: 
ELENA: 
JO: I'm on hour thirteen of a twelve hour shift. Maybe someone could have shot me a text?
ELENA: 
JO: So, Kai's gone?
ELENA: 
JO: That's amazing news! That's really amazing news.
ELENA: 
ELENA: 
JO: The last thing this baby needs is an Uncle Psychopath.
ELENA: You and Alaric are having a baby! I... 
ENZO: 
SARAH: I know. Starting with trusting my vampire stalker, who arranged for me to befriend some blue-eyed bartender, all so I could witness him getting run over, and you playing the part of the hero. 
ENZO: Well, that saves me an awkward conversation.
SARAH: 
ENZO: Don't beat yourself up. I remember what it was like to be so naive.
DOCTOR: The bacilli have spread to most of your lungs, carving out cavities in the tissue. The bleeding will continue.
ENZO: 
DOCTOR: I believe so, but the dosage required at this late stage is expensive.
LILY: Payment isn't an issue, provided your curative is effective.
DOCTOR: I can assure you it is.
LILY: 
DOCTOR: 
ENZO: What? Why are you saying that? I thought you could help me.
LILY: 
DOCTOR: He'll die within the week. Chances are, he'll never see land again.
LILY: 
ENZO: You should go as well. I do not wish to repay your acts of kindness by affecting you.
LILY: You can't. I've already had consumption.
ENZO: 
LILY: I didn't.
ENZO: What are you, an angel?
CAROLINE: Hahaha!
TYLER: 
CAROLINE: Let's play "Caroline Trivia!"
TYLER: I don't even know what that is.
CAROLINE: Oh, sure you do! You both dated me, which means you should know everything about me. So, I'm gonna ask you some questions about myself, and whoever answers them right lives.
MATT: You're sick.
CAROLINE: 
TYLER: 
CAROLINE: Very good! Alright, Matt. Your turn. What is my favorite color?
MATT: That's a trick question. You don't have a favorite color.
CAROLINE: 
TYLER: 
CAROLINE: Oh, I'm sure I mentioned it at some point.
MATT: No, you didn't.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Well, looks like, uh, Whitmore's gonna need a new philosophy TA. 
CAROLINE: 
JO: Judging by the victims, they started at the library, they took out a couple security guards near the football field, and then they wandered over to the movie theater.
ELENA: 
JO: Doctor 101. Becoming desensitized goes with the territory.
ELENA: Actually, the reason why I'm not shocked is because I've been in their shoes, and I was just as bad. And this is all just one big, horrible reminder that there's always going to be a part of me that's capable of doing what they're doing.
JO: 
ELENA: For a while, maybe, until little Stevie becomes teenage Steven and I haven't aged a day.
JO: Have you told Damon about this?
ELENA: 
JO: I saw how you reacted when you found out I was pregnant.
ELENA: 
JO: 
ELENA: I'm just happy for you and Alaric.
JO: Alaric, who used to be a vampire, now is a human having a kid. Have you discussed this with your boyfriend?
ELENA: He knows how I feel. But, he also knows that there's nothing we can do to change that, so there's no point in dwelling.
JO: Okay.
SARAH: So, how do I know you're not the one who's been mind-controlling me, making me believe this messed-up family history?
ENZO: You were ripped from the womb of a dead woman. Stefan compelled away the truth, but the emotional scars still linger. How else do you explain your morbid fascinations, hmm? 
SARAH: Well, there's something about death that I find... I don't know...
ENZO: 
ENZO: I haven't heard that song since I was a boy.
LILY: 
ENZO: Why are you doing this?
LILY: Is it so hard to believe someone could do you a kindness?
ENZO: I was abandoned at a workhouse at the age of four. It was not a place known for its kindness.
LILY: I know what it is to be tossed aside like rubbish. I was sent to a sanatorium to rot. Left to die. Abandoned by my own husband, who prayed the end would come quickly, not so that I would be spared pain and misery, but so that he would be unburdened by me. But, I was given a reprieve, and it was only once I was unshackled from a life that didn't want me that I found my true family.
ENZO: Is that where you're heading, to meet them?
LILY: 
ENZO: It would appear the end is coming.
LILY: 
LILY: Drink this, Lorenzo.
LILY: If your brother's on the hunt, he won't be staying in one place.
DAMON: Yeah? Well, we have to start somewhere. Elena said she treated some kid who was attacked coming out of modern European history. 
LILY: 
DAMON: 
LILY: What if I say the wrong thing? A century and a half is a long time to be away.
DAMON: You'll be fine. 
LILY: 
DAMON: Yeah. 1903. You found out we were vampires, you landed in New York Harbor after a forty-year romp in Europe, and you...
DAMON: Oh. You weren't coming to get us.
LILY: 
DAMON: You can do this. All we have to do is just try.
LILY: I have been trying, Damon! Since I laid my eyes on you yesterday, I have been trying with all of my heart to connect with the woman who was your mother, to remember what it felt like to mourn you and your brother after I was banished by your father. After I was turned, the only thing more powerful than the longing I felt for you was the fear of what I would do if I ever saw you again. So, I stayed away. I had to find others who could help me find my way back to myself, and... by the time my new family helped me to do that, everything I felt for my old family-- for you and your brother-- was gone. I hate that I can't make myself feel more. I'm so sorry.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Sounds good to me.
STEFAN: Oooh! Looks like somebody's angry.
CAROLINE: 
TYLER: And you wonder why everyone hates vampires? Look at you, messing with people for no reason! That's really brave.
MATT: What are you doing?
STEFAN: 
TYLER: 
STEFAN: No, actually, I'm just not used to people being this stupid.
MATT: Alright, Ty, stop. He will kill you. 
CAROLINE: 
TYLER: 
TYLER: Come on. Either of you, come at me!
MATT: Ty, stop!
STEFAN: Hey, Caroline? I will gladly kill him for you, but I know what a jerk he was during your relationship, so if you want...
CAROLINE: 
MATT: 
TYLER: Get out of here, Matt.
CAROLINE: Nice going, Tyler!
ELENA: 
DAMON: Well, she was her overly-proper self, but yeah-- that was the gist of it. But, hey, you know, I'm not planning on honoring my end of the plan by jail-breaking her friends, so... Tch, figure we're even.
ELENA: 
DAMON: Nah, it's fine. 150 years is a long time to care.
ELENA: Says the guy who pined for Katherine Pierce for over a century and a half!
DAMON: 
ELENA: It's okay to feel hurt, Damon. She was the second woman to abandon you.
DAMON: 
ELENA: 
DAMON: Stefan's also not a moron.
ELENA: 
DAMON: Where the hell are you going?
LILY: 
DAMON: 
LILY: What if I fail to bring him back?
DAMON: You won't fail.
LILY: I need to be assured that-- regardless of the outcome with your brother today-- I can count on you to help me get my people back.
DAMON: 
LILY: 
DAMON: Why would I lie?
LILY: You have the power to give your greatest love the human life she desires, and you have yet to be truthful with her.
DAMON: 
SARAH: So, some Good Samaritan vampire saves you from dying, gives you super-strength, mind control, and you never grow old? Sounds like a pretty good deal to me.
ENZO: Yeah, that's because you don't know about the hunger.
ENZO: 
ENZO: 
DOCTOR: The woman who helped you-- she killed them all. Everyone's dead.
ENZO: 
DOCTOR: I don't know. She told me to come find you. 
ENZO: After feeding on the charlatan, I searched all over that ship for that woman, but she was gone. Her promises of a new life and a new family were lies. She made me a monster, and then abandoned me.
SARAH: For what reason?
ENZO: Who knows? Probably some sick game.
SARAH: Like the one you were playing with me?
ENZO: Exactly. The goal was the same. I wanted to do to you what had been done to me-- to make you a monster.
TYLER: I'm sorry, Matt. Come one. You can't die on me, man.
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: Ooh, that's a very good question. I mean, if all that rage made you think that you could take us both, maybe this is Nature's way of reconnecting you with your true self?
TYLER: Shut up!
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: It's my mother.
DAMON: Come on. Get him out of here. Here, take my car.
TYLER: 
CAROLINE: So... you have a mother?
STEFAN: I had a mom. She died. So, whoever this is is Damon's lame attempt to get my humanity back on.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: Sorry, Stefan. But thanks for the head start.
TYLER: Elena! We need help!
ELENA: Oh, my God! Matt! It's okay, you'll be fine.
MATT: No.
TYLER: 
MATT: 
ELENA: 
MATT: Where's Jo? 
ELENA: Matt!
MATT: Help!
ELENA: What just happened?
LILY: Here. Let me help you.
STEFAN: Ugh!
LILY: I'm sure you have many questions...
STEFAN: 
LILY: 
DAMON: 
LILY: If only I'd been there to see you grow into a young man, to protect you from your father's temper. But, I was so ashamed of the things that I'd done, of what I'd become, and by the time I got my appetite under control and was coming back for you and your brother, I was hunted down and banished to a prison world by the Gemini.
DAMON: 
LILY: ...Was the hope of seeing my sons again. 
DAMON: 
LILY: Your angel has returned to you, and I will never leave you again.
STEFAN: 
LILY: 
STEFAN: How'd you find her?
DAMON: On the list of things to be worrying about, she's not one of them. 
STEFAN: 
ELENA: 
MATT: 
ELENA: Then why are you refusing my blood?
MATT: Do you know how many times I've died, or nearly died? Most of those times were at the hands of people I thought were my friends. 
ELENA: 
MATT: Don't give me the "we're not all like that" speech, Elena, because you are. Just one flip of a switch away.
ELENA: 
MATT: I can't say that I hate vampires, and then use them when it's to my advantage. I can't have it both ways, Elena. That's just how it is to me.
ENZO: Good. Now that the vervain's out of your system, how does South Hampton sound? 
SARAH: Or, you could give me the choice you never had. 
ENZO: Ah, but you'll be safe.
SARAH: What if I swore never to seek out the Salvatores? From what you've told me, I don't want any part of my real family.
ENZO: Have a nice life, Sarah Nelson.
DAMON: Well, Matt lives to hate vampires another day, Stefan's on Caroline-duty, and I just introduced Mom to Uber. Taking bets on which one goes south first!
ELENA: 
DAMON: 
ELENA: 
DAMON: Why not?
ELENA: Because, I think I was... I don't know.
DAMON: ...Jealous?
ELENA: Yeah, a little. I mean, I've always wanted a family. Before, you know... So, it's kind of a bummer of a reminder that that's never gonna happen for me. 
DAMON: What if things could be different? What if you could change everything?
ELENA: They're not, and I can't. Nothing's changed.
DAMON: 
ELENA: 
DAMON: This better be important.
JO: 
ELENA: 
DAMON: 
ELENA: 
JO: 
DAMON: Tell me.
JO: 
JO: Lily turned them, resulting in creatures that are both witch and vampire.
ELENA: But, that's not possible. Vampires can't be witches.
JO: These are witches that have magic only when they siphon power from another source.
JO: As vampires...
DAMON: 
JO: They were on their way to destroy the Gemini, but the coven got to them first. Put them in exile.
JO: Heretics are ruthless-- vampires with witch power, an aberration of Nature. They can never be allowed to escape. Imagine Kai with the bloodlust of a vampire. Now, imagine six of them.
