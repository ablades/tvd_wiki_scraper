DAMON: No.
DAMON: 
DAMON: 
DAMON: Bon.
DAMON: 
DAMON: I didn't know where I was. I didn't know I was out--
DAMON: Ohh.
DAMON: Oh, yup. I saw this coming.
LOUISE: ...Ababbas Dogoineh... Ababbas Dogoineh... Melunah... Washaset...
DAMON: Stefan.
DAMON: Stefan.
STEFAN: Yeah. Yeah I heard you.
DAMON: No vervain this time? We switching up the menu?
STEFAN: Nah, I just wanted to make sure you had a chance to calm down.
DAMON: Oh, I'm calm.
DAMON: No, no, no. You're gonna say to me. You're gonna say to me, I screwed up so bad. I nearly killed all of our friends because I thought I was stuck in a fake hell-world.
STEFAN: You don't have to explain. It wasn't your fault.
DAMON: Huh?
STEFAN: It was an honest mistake. You're getting a pass.
DAMON: Wait. You skipped a bunch of stuff. First, I'm supposed to say I see the error of my ways, and then you tell me that that's not good enough, and then you judge me harder. And then I say something mean, but true, that totally throws you off balance.
STEFAN: You came out of the phoenix stone but you thought you were still inside of it. Everybody understands.
DAMON: Oh. That's pretty generous, considering I just stabbed your pregnant girlfriend in the chest...
STEFAN: Yeah, well the hellstone does a number on you.
DAMON: Yeah, Yeah it does. Well I'm here. And it's real. I'm ready for my bro hug.
DAMON: I'll wait until you've unchained me, brother.
STEFAN: Here's the thing, Damon. Um, Hell messes with you, but post-hell is much worse.
DAMON: 
TYLER: You guys gotta be kidding me!
TYLER: This is still my house.
DAMON: Tyler Lockwoof.
DAMON: Yeah, Stefan, I thought my allergies were acting up.
STEFAN: I didn't know you were back.
TYLER: Caroline invited me to her baby shower. Although she failed to mention the part about Mystic Falls going to crap. What the hell happened out there?
DAMON: Oh, you know. We had to evacuate. Scary Heretics. Fictional mining fires. You weren't CC'd on the memo?
STEFAN: I don't think he's talking about the evacuation, Damon.
DAMON: So what is he talking about? I know you didn't manage to screw the whole town up all over again while I was on my weekend trip to limbo.
STEFAN: 
JULIAN: Ellis, tell your friends to bring something back from their hunt. We need to stock the bar for happy hour.
ELLIS: Hey! No killing dinner. On my count.
ELLIS: Three, two, one. Go!
JULIAN: Who's thirsty?!
MATT: What's wrong? Damon text-bombing you empty apologies?
BONNIE: No, I'm letting Stefan deal with Damon.
MATT: Oh, that's smart. Until Damon manipulates Stefan into thinking he's changed and then he's our problem again.
BONNIE: 
BONNIE: Oh, my God.
MATT: 
BONNIE: 
MATT: 
BONNIE: 'Cause it just matched us.
MATT: Oh, you wish, Mystic Queen.
BONNIE: Okay, we gotta get you a new profile picture. Is that a gun?
MATT: Yeah, I was in my uniform. I'm not gonna crop my gun out.
BONNIE: Okay, I'm not trying to be in your business, but maybe showing a softer side will get you more hits.
BONNIE: Errox femus!
BONNIE: Matt. Matt! Okay, he's dead.
MATT: At least Lily kept her Heretics on leash. I guess it's safe to say I lost my soft side.
BONNIE: Okay. Come on. Let's get these bodies out of here.
DAMON: You delegated Deputy Doolittle to patrol the streets with his witchy ride-along? Are you sure Bonnie put the right soul back in your body? I mean, what happened to your hero-hair campaign to protect Mystic Falls?
STEFAN: 
DAMON: 
STEFAN: You have no idea what I have been through.
DAMON: Alright, brother. You have a captive audience. What'd I miss?
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Super fancy. Even my purse has a chair.
STEFAN: Well, we're celebrating, so I figured we'd take it up a notch, right?
CAROLINE: Absolutely. So, what wine are you feeling like?
STEFAN: I don't care. Whatever you want.
CAROLINE: Well, I'm drinking water...
STEFAN: Right. Sorry.
CAROLINE: Are you sure that you're up for this? I know it's the first time you've really been out since you woke up.
STEFAN: I'm... I'm fine. Thank you, though.
CAROLINE: Okay, good. Because Bonnie thinks she's close to pulling Damon out. She said that she felt especially strong today.
CAROLINE: And with any luck, we'll be celebrating something else soon.
DAMON: Hello, lovers. Miss me?
STEFAN: How'd you get here?
STEFAN: Get away from her!
CAROLINE: Stefan, stop. What are you doing?
STEFAN: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
DAMON: So you got out of hell, you're on the up-and-up, and then you started hallucinating me as a waiter. I mean, I couldn't be a manager or something?
STEFAN: I think you're missing the point.
DAMON: 
DAMON: I'm not gonna have a psychotic break, brother. I promise.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: I'm 100% okay.
STEFAN: Good. Then you can prove it to me while I drive you around the new Mystic Falls.
DAMON: Great.
MAN: Damon...
HENRY: Peek-a-boo.
STEFAN: Ready?
DAMON: Yeah. All good.
CAROLINE: Are you really worried about Damon or is this just a convenient excuse to get out of the baby-food-tasting game?
STEFAN: Well, if that is what I think it is, then I would rather be sent back to the hellstone.
CAROLINE: Honestly, I don't blame you. But Alaric needs this. You know, he doesn't have the necessary accouterments of a single father-to-be.
STEFAN: Well, don't worry. I'm gonna still get him that Baby Bjorn thing, or whatever you made me click on when I was drunk.
CAROLINE: Thank you. Hey, be safe today, okay? I finally got you back to reality. I want to keep you in one piece.
STEFAN: Don't you worry. I will. Bye.
DAMON: Oh, boy.
STEFAN: What?
DAMON: Wah-psh!
STEFAN: Just get inside.
DAMON: Lovely.
STEFAN: Yeah. Well, you get used to the smell.
DAMON: 
STEFAN: Well, they tried, but apparently, you weren't ready to be pulled out.
STEFAN: What happened to you in there?
DAMON: Picture me as a soldier in gray being shot to death over and over and over again while the ghost of Mommie Dearest floated on her harpy wings, saying, "I told you so, Damon."
STEFAN: Sounds pretty miserable, if you ask me.
DAMON: Well, I think that was the point. I just realized all I had to do was cry some big-boy tears and tell Mommy I was sorry.
STEFAN: 
DAMON: It did the trick, because right after that, I went toward the red light in the sky....
DAMON: What about you? How'd you pass your existential dealio?
JULIAN: Look who survived.
DAMON: Look who infested my town because he has nothing better to do with his eternity.
JULIAN: 
STEFAN: Well, I wouldn't call you taking over my town without my permission a truce exactly...
JULIAN: 
DAMON: You gonna take that, hmm?
JULIAN: Ooh.
STEFAN: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Today's all about proving that you can play well with others, all right?
JULIAN: There's no need to pout. I'm not gonna hurt your precious town. It holds sentimental value for me as well. This was Lily's home once. Now it's mine.
JULIAN: Well, anyway...
JULIAN: I'm making this about myself when here you are, back with the living. Congratulations! Although, now's where the real work begins, doesn't it?
JULIAN: Good luck to you both.
HENRY: Can I get you another one, soldier?
STEFAN: Damon...
DAMON: Yeah...
STEFAN: Hey, what are you looking at?
DAMON: One too many pieces of vampire trash.
JULIAN: Are you certain you're still suited to be his wing man? I expect you're still adjusting yourself.
STEFAN: I think I'm handling it. Thanks.
JULIAN: Yes. When I first got out, I thought I was... Handling it, too.
JULIAN: Ahh.
GUEST: And GO!
CAROLINE: This is a nightmare.
BONNIE: Are you kidding me? This is the best blackmail material ever.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: --Their only parent. A man who's hardly inspiring any confidence...
GUEST: Time!
ALARIC: YES!
CAROLINE: Huh!
ALARIC: That's terrifying.
ALARIC: You're never babysitting. Neither of you. Ever.
MATT: I made a helmet!
CAROLINE: 
ALARIC: 
ALARIC: Though, I could dismantle a bomb blindfolded if I needed to...
CAROLINE: Ha ha. There's nothing funnier than newborns and C4!
ALARIC: So I shouldn't store my explosives in the nursery? I think I read that in one of the twentyparenting magazines you left in my office...
CAROLINE: 
ALARIC: No, no! Actually, you are an incredibly generous friend, who I will forever be indebted to.
CAROLINE: Well, it's not about debt...
CAROLINE: As long as you understand... once these babies are born, I will not be on-call 24/7 to burp and bathe and feed and diaper...
ALARIC: I get it, Caroline. I... I don't expect that to be your problem.
CAROLINE: Well, it's not a problem. It's just that there's-- Oof!
CAROLINE: Baby A just kicked.
ALARIC: Oh, she did? Really?
CAROLINE: Mmhmm.
ALARIC: Haha! Oh, damn! My daughter's a ninja!
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: There goes Baby B.
ALARIC: 
CAROLINE: Of course!
TYLER: Ahhh. And I almost have my manhood back.
MATT: Yeah, "almost" being the operative word.
TYLER: 
MATT: I can't. I'm on duty.
TYLER: 
MATT: So, that's it, huh? You're just gonna give up? We grew up there, Ty. That is your town.
TYLER: Was my town. Now it's a cesspool that's not worth getting killed over. Getting out was the best thing that ever happened to me.
TYLER: Who's that?
MATT: 
BONNIE: Hey. Wasn't sure you'd make it.
NORA: 
BONNIE: Did you buy off the registry?
NORA: 
BONNIE: Socks count as practical. Good. That's how we'll sell it to Caroline.
BONNIE: Come on. I'll get you a drink. Although, fair warning, they're in baby bottles.
NORA: Ah. Infants drinking. What a lovely image. Can't say I'm surprised.
HENRY: Are you just going to surrender your town to the enemy?
DAMON: 
HENRY: You passed the test, yes, but you haven't completed your liberation.
DAMON: 
DAMON: ...Very realistic head-trip.
DAMON: We should probably skip the check.
MATT: So, you want to tell me what the Heretic's doing here?
BONNIE: 
MATT: 
BONNIE: 
MATT: 
BONNIE: I see her studying by herself every day. And honestly? I felt bad. So, I invited her. It's better to have a powerful Heretic as a friend than an enemy.
NORA: And I'm quite good at gifts-- don't forget that.
NORA: Perhaps it's time for me to leave...
MATT: Yeah, perhaps you should.
BONNIE: No, I invited you. You should stay.
NORA: I would, but I'm afraid your friend here may say something inappropriate to me, and then find himself never able to speak again.
MATT: 
NORA: Oh, I didn't, actually. That would have looked like this.
NORA: Take another step toward me, and I'll pluck your vocal cords from your throat and use them to play a rather sporting game of "Pin the tail on the Deputy."
BONNIE: 
NORA: The party was lovely. Thank you.
STEFAN: When were you going to tell me that you lost your grip on reality?
DAMON: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Worse than you envisioning me as a waiter? Who was I next? A busboy? A valet?
STEFAN: You were everywhere.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Another nightmare?
STEFAN: Yeah. The same one. I was in the quarry. I was... I was drowning, and Damon was there.
CAROLINE: Damon was there? Then what?
STEFAN: Doesn't matter. Its over.
CAROLINE: Clearly it's not. Whatever you experienced in that rock is still torturing you somehow.
DAMON: You're lucky you have her to hold onto, brother.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Who are you talking to?
STEFAN: Get out of here, Caroline.
DAMON: Yeah, get out of here, Caroline! Before I rip those babies right out of your belly.
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: Stop! It's not real. It's not real!
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Where's Mom when you need her? 'Cause fat chance you're winning this showdown.
STEFAN: Why are you still here?
DAMON: I'm a piece of the stone puzzle. If you figure it out, I'll leave you alone. Until then...
STEFAN: 
STEFAN: I couldn't stop seeing you. I couldn't stop hearing you. Nothing else mattered. Not our town, not Julian, not even Caroline. All I cared about was making you go away.
DAMON: So? Pins and needles over here, brother. What did you do?
STEFAN: I got a can of gasoline...
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: What are you doing?
STEFAN: 
CAROLINE: 
STEFAN: 
DAMON: Well, that explains why I smelled like gas when I woke up.
JULIAN: This is what your brother did to Ellis!
JULIAN: 
JULIAN: Well, I strongly recommend that you find him first.
JULIAN: Hmmm. No, I assure you, he was not.
JULIAN: You were alone when I arrived. You were talking to yourself. Perhaps that stone isn't finished with you after all?
JULIAN: In the meantime, if either you or your brother harm one of my men again, I will gut one of you and feed the other the entrails.
TYLER: Anything to avoid a guessing game about how big Caroline's belly is.
TYLER: What do you want?
TYLER: That's not an option.
TYLER: When you gave me her coffin, you made me swear to not let anybody see her. Especially you.
TYLER: You told me that's what you would say. You figured at some point, you'd get impatient, or lose your nerve, or have a really bad day. You said under no circumstance am I allowed to give her to you.
TYLER: 
MATT: Damnit!
MATT: Oh, man...
PENNY: Grove Hill PD. License and registration, please.
MATT: Officer, look... I'm a cop, too, if you let me just show you my badge.
PENNY: Mr. Donovan. The good news is you actually have a valid license, which means at some point, you did learn how to drive. The bad news is, that can only mean you're swerving between lanes because you're drunk.
MATT: 
PENNY: 
MATT: 
TYLER: 
HENRY: Me again.
CAROLINE: Excuse me for one second.
CAROLINE: Hey...
CAROLINE: I'm sorry, I was using it for the playlist. Are... Are you okay?
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: Okay, okay. Stefan, just calm down. Focus. Okay? Wha... What is going on?
CAROLINE: 
HENRY: I can't leave until you find liberation. You're still denying your nature. You haven't let go of what's holding you back.
HENRY: A Phoenix Stone. It doesn't trap you. It frees you... to be reborn as your true self.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: Yeah, until you passed some kind of test. You never told me how you earned your freedom.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: You can't keep hiding like this, Stefan. You can't. Just please, let me help you.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: God. You can't go on like this.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: Do you really believe that?
HENRY: You took my words to heart, did you?
HENRY: You're right. You're not doing it with me anymore.
HENRY: I promised you liberation.
HENRY: This was necessary, Damon. She held you back from being the monster you really are!
BONNIE: In case it wasn't obvious, today was supposed to be a fresh start.
NORA: Oh, spare me the lecture.
BONNIE: What the hell is your problem? I was trying to be nice to you.
NORA: After I left your wretched party, I found this in my mail.
NORA: 
BONNIE: Postcard? You have a pen pal.
NORA: 
BONNIE: 
NORA: It's a warning... From the Huntress.
BONNIE: 
NORA: You certainly know her weapon.
BONNIE: ...A sword.
NORA: Yes. Custom-made for her. She used it to put Julian in the stone, along with thousands of other vampires. She's ruthless. Once you've been marked by her sword, she never stops hunting you. That's how Beau got his scar. She'll come to him now. She'll come for all of us.
BONNIE: Then how do we stop her?
NORA: There's no stopping her-- ever. And there's no "we" involved. Besides, she's not after you, so it's really not your concern.
BONNIE: 
NORA: Then what do you propose we do?
PENNY: All right, Officer Donovan, you're clear to go. But I can't let you drive yourself home.
MATT: I think I'll wait it out.
PENNY: Sure you don't want to call a friend? That girl who does our turn-down service just left.
MATT: 
PENNY: I heard about your graduation... the whole freak mining fire thing? I can't imagine what it'd be like to lose half my class. Sorry you had to go through that.
MATT: Thanks.
PENNY: It's weird town officials didn't get FEMA involved, or at least increase emergency response. It's almost like everyone's resigned to letting the fires burn out on their own.
MATT: Yeah. That's the way it seems.
PENNY: Except if everyone sits around doing nothing, there's not gonna be a town left.
PENNY: Anyway, good night.
PENNY: Oh, and, uh, one last thing. What the hell did we find in your truck?
ALARIC: Ugh, phew!
CAROLINE: Um, I think that I should wash these onesies with the... hypoallergenic detergent first. Where are the keys to the laundry room?
ALARIC: It's midnight, Caroline. I mean, we've got plenty of time to take care of all this stuff.
CAROLINE: Yeah, I know. I know. We should also really get a head start on those car seats, because I read somewhere that first-time parents are just always messing those up. And did you happen to notice if the monitor came with little batteries? You don't have any around here. And the last thing that you need are just these screaming, crying babies in the middle of the night, and you can't even hear them...
ALARIC: Hey, what's going on with you? You okay?
CAROLINE: When were you gonna tell me that you're leaving?
ALARIC: ...When I officially got the job.
CAROLINE: And what's wrong with the job that you have now?
ALARIC: There's nothing wrong with the job. It's the place.
CAROLINE: 
ALARIC: Caroline, I am not raising my kids anywhere near Mystic Falls or Whitmore College or...
CAROLINE: Vampires.
ALARIC: 
CAROLINE: Yeah. No, it was--
ALARIC: Caroline, I was under the impression, you know, that once the babies were born... That you weren't gonna be involved.
CAROLINE: Uh, no. I won't, because they're not mine. They're yours and Jo's. Anyway, I actually think it's really smart. You know, safety first. You and your babies should get as far away from here as you can.
CAROLINE: 
CAROLINE: What are you doing here? I thought you were in Mystic Falls.
MATT: 
CAROLINE: 
MATT: 
CAROLINE: Thank you.
MATT: You can go now.
CAROLINE: 
MATT: You already did what we needed.
CAROLINE: We? You're helping her?
MATT: You're the easiest way to get to Stefan. Don't take it personally.
CAROLINE: "Don't take it personally?" I have a family, Matt.
