</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, a waitress comes into the main room]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> WAITRESS: Sorry, we're closed, and...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She finally gets a good look at Caroline and her three-year-old twins and scoffs in disgust]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> WAITRESS: I don't think so.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: We're not staying. We just got here, and... then I realized, I didn't actually know where the person I'm looking for lived. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The waitress is only half listening as she sets up candles on the tables, so Caroline gets to the point]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Klaus Mikaelson?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The waitress looks at her, both exasperated and slightly sympathetic]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> WAITRESS: Honey, hate to say this, but you've wasted a trip.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Look... I know that he comes here, okay? My name's Caroline Forbes. He'll know me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> WAITRESS: I don't care who you are. Klaus Mikaelson is <i>gone</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Gone? Gone where?

<dl><dd> WAITRESS: I mean, no one has seen or heard from that man in...

<p><i>[Stefan has just pulled into a GEORGIA GAS STATION in a stolen Jeep while he talks to Valerie, who is at the LOCKWOOD MANSION, on the phone. The scene has cut in mid-conversation]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[on the phone]</i> South Georgia, I think. I just ditched my car and passed Grantville off the I-85.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[At the LOCKWOOD MANSION, Valerie is leaning against the desk in Mayor Lockwood's study, where she's carefully studying a map and is leading Stefan where he needs to go on speaker phone]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Okay, you're about to come upon Highway 27. Take it north. Eventually, you'll connect with the I-20 and want to take that west.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: And where is this leading me, exactly?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: A safe house that's been imbued with a magical disruption spell. Even the strongest magic can't penetrate its walls, which means Rayna Cruz's sword can't track you there. Did you find 27 yet?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: No, I just pulled over at a Quik-Stop in the middle of nowhere.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie, horrified, takes the phone off of speaker and picks it up to hold it to her ear]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[frustrated]</i> Tell me you're joking.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: My cell phone's almost dead. I need a charger.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Stefan, that's a mistake. Get back in your car. Stefan, you can't stop moving <i>ever</i>. Stefan, are you there? 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan, at the GAS STATION, apparently not hearing Valerie's warnings, tries to get her attention]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hello? 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He looks down at his phone before once again trying to get through to Valerie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hello?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan gives up and walks into the GAS STATION to quickly buy a charger, sighing in frustration as he walks through the door]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Meanwhile, Rayna, driving a motorcycle with her sword strapped to her back in a large scabbard, is speeding toward Stefan's location on the highway]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Back at the GAS STATION, Stefan has just stepped up to the cashier's counter to get his charger]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hi, I need to buy a charger for my phone?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The cashier, a young man, turns to look at the chargers hanging on the wall behind him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CASHIER: Okay, we've got the brick charger... the adapter for your car... This one's solar powered, pretty neat...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan, clearly in a hurry, just nods and picks up one of the boxes without really looking at it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: That's fine. How much?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CASHIER: That'll be $22.50.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan is in the middle of reaching for his wallet when he looks up at the surveillance camera footage on the flat screen TV behind the counter, and when he sees Rayna parking her motorcycle and taking off her helmet behind the shop, he starts to panic and simply runs out of the store without paying. The cashier looks appalled by this behavior]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CASHIER: HEY!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Rayna walks in through the back door while Stefan walks out through the front, and when she sees him, she throws her sword, which hits the door and gets its blade wedged in the glass. Stefan, both horrified and relieved that the blade didn't hit him, moves the ice machine in front of the door at vampire speed before getting into his new Jeep and speeding away, his tires squealing as he does so]</i>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="THE_ARMORY_HEADQUARTERS"> THE ARMORY HEADQUARTERS </span></h2>
<p><i>[Bonnie and Damon have just arrived at the headquarters of The Armory in Damon's Camaro. The building looks like a moderately-sized castle, and Bonnie is in the middle of checking her phone when she and Damon get out of the car and look around. She seems concerned by what she's just learned]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Valerie said she just lost cell reception with Stefan.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon's voice is bitter and worried when he replies]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: As if ruining his life wasn't enough for me to worry about, now we get to wonder when you and Valerie exchanged numbers.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: You told Stefan you would find a way to get him off the hook with Rayna, and I told Caroline I'd make sure you didn't screw it up. So, we both have a lot riding on this.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon and Bonnie walk up to the door, which Enzo opens to greet them on the massive front porch]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Good. You made it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo turns and jerks his head toward the door to indicate that they should follow him inside. Once they walk through the door, they enter a series of large rooms full of old, antique furniture and glass cases full of what appear to be ancient artifacts. Bonnie and Damon look around with both curiosity and suspicion]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Where the hell are we?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: This is The Armory, home to a society of supernatural artifact collectors. We keep them under lock and key so they don't fall into the wrong hands. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon picks up a metal mask resting on one of the stands and scoffs]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: The Armory... Never heard of it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon looks over at Bonnie, who seems just as clueless]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[rolls her eyes]</i> No.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[amused]</i> Yeah, that's kind of the point. They've taken great care to keep themselves out of history as we know it. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon's voice takes on a mocking tone as he and Bonnie continue to look around at the huge room they're in]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: And, for three easy payments of $19.99, we, too, can be members.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon gives Enzo an annoyed look as he walks over to face him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: How about we just cut to the part where they can save my brother? Where's the cavalry, man?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: They're out on their own supernatural treasure hunt. But, lucky you, they've recruited <i>me</i> to nab Rayna Cruz. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon scoffs, and Bonnie gives him a look that says that she's not trusting his explanations]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Ever since that <i>annoying</i> Phoenix Stone turned up in Mystic Falls, she's been top priority. They actually consider her one of the... supernatural wonders of the world. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[suspiciously]</i> And why do <i>you</i> care what they want?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: They have something <i>I</i> want.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
<i>[The scene cuts to a FLASHBACK to after Enzo was knocked out and captured by Matt in <a href="/wiki/Cold_as_Ice" title="Cold as Ice">Cold as Ice</a>. A beautiful woman with dark hair walks into a room with a glowing green digital lock, where Enzo was strapped down to a gurney. Enzo narrates what happened in voiceover for Bonnie and Damon]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALEX: Good morning. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[voiceover] When The Armory kidnapped me four months ago, it wasn't to torture me. A woman named Alex made me an offer.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo, still bound to the gurney, looks at Alex warily as she picks up a scalpel from the table and stares at him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Who the hell are you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: Someone who needs your help. And, in return, can provide you with information you desperately want.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: If it's all the same, I'd rather just be cut loose and be on my way.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: Be my guest. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alex uses the scalpel to cut the ropes binding Enzo's wrists to his waist. Once he's freed, he quickly rips the rest of the ropes off while Alex walks toward the door]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALEX: I just... figured you'd want to know who your family was, orphan and all.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: How do you know about my family?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: Because... as obnoxious as it sounds, we like to think we know everything.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Without another word, Alex waves her hand in front of the glowing green lock on the door, which causes it to open and allow her to leave the room. Enzo frowns, clearly torn between leaving and learning the information about his family that Alex claims to have]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Back in the PRESENT DAY, Enzo is wrapping up his story for Damon and Bonnie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Needless to say, I've been working for The Armory ever since. Look, all we need to do is get Stefan here, and Rayna will have no choice but to follow. A rat to the cheese. We spring the trap, and The Armory keeps her under lock and key forever after. Everyone gets on with their lives.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When Damon and Bonnie don't say anything, Enzo sighs]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: What do you say?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, I'll have to discuss this with my counsel.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo nods, having expected this response, and turns away to let him consult with Bonnie. The two give each other a silent look for a long moment before Bonnie turns back to Enzo]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Okay, we're in.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WHITMORE_COLLEGE_MEDICAL_CENTER"> WHITMORE COLLEGE MEDICAL CENTER </span></h2>
<p><i>[Alaric has just walked into Caroline's hospital room with two diaper bags slung over his shoulder just as a woman's voice is heard over the PA system]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> PA SYSTEM: <i>Dr. Norris, dial 118...</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline smiles at Alaric as he walks toward her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Mmm, must be time for another check-up!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She chuckles quietly, but Alaric looks serious, which concerns her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Actually, there's something I need to talk to you about...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[worried]</i> What's going on?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: I'm moving to Dallas. I'm leaving today.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline gapes at him in shock]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: What?? No, Ric, you still need a house, and a nanny, and the right school district...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[urgently]</i> I don't care. After I saw their little faces yesterday, everything changed.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Is this about that psycho huntress? Because you can rest assured that she is <i>very</i> far away from here, pursuing my equally far from here boyfriend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[sighs]</i> No, it's not about her, okay? It's about Jo... And the promise I made to her to leave town after we got married. And we know how that turned out, okay? So, I'm not making that mistake twice. And <i>certainly</i> not with my kids.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Do you know how hard it is to travel with one newborn, let alone two? Two car seats, two feeding schedules, crying in surround-sound, not to mention the driving part.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: I know. And stopping every ninety minutes. I get it. Which is why I've hired a nurse to come with me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: A nurse? Who? Frankie with the heart murmur? Or Jarica, the perpetual boyfriend-texter?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: ...Jarica.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[scoffs]</i> Come on!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Do you have a better idea?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Me! <i>I'm</i> the better idea.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Uhh, but you just... got through major surgery. You just had a C-section.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: And I'm all healed up. That is the <i>one</i> and <i>only</i> perk of a vampire pregnancy. I can either sit here, alone, freaking out that my boyfriend is somewhere in this country trying to outrun a huntress that will stop at nothing to kill him, or I can be useful. It's up to you.

<p><i>[Stefan has just arrived to New Orleans, where he puts a large bandage over the still-unhealed X-shaped wound from Rayna's sword before walking into ST. JAMES INFIRMARY and heading straight for the bar, sighing as he sits down. After a moment, a shot is slid down the table toward him, revealing Klaus has appeared next to him at the bar and looks both amused and slightly suspicious, though he smirks devilishly at him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> KLAUS: Welcome to New Orleans, old friend. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan stares at him in shock. Their conversation continues after the break]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> KLAUS: As I live and breathe. Stefan Salvatore in the Crescent City. This ought to be very good, or <i>entertainingly</i> bad.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I'm just in town for a little R &amp; R. Hate to disappoint. So... How are Elijah, and, uh, whoever else you've brought back from the dead? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KLAUS: Oh, you know the Mikaelsons. Never a dull moment. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan's phone buzzes, but he turns it off]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> KLAUS: So, of all the gin joints, you pick ours... Four walls invulnerable to the magic of those pesky locator spells. Bit of a coincidence, isn't it?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Damon's looking for me, and I don't want to be found. I figure you, of all people, can relate to family drama.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KLAUS: Sylvia, this is an old friend. Please keep his cup brimming.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> SYLVIA: Mmm. Cute old friend. Where have you been hiding him?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KLAUS: Quaint little place called Mystic Falls. Home of the mining fires that prompted a town-wide evacuation. It was very noble of you to stand up for the human faction as you did, in such uncharacteristically sweeping, dramatic fashion.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I did have some help.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KLAUS: How <i>is</i> Caroline?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Sylvia, I think we're gonna need another round.

</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: What do you mean you don't know where Rayna is? She's wherever Stefan is.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: No one knows where he is, either. He's not taking anyone's calls, and I can't triangulate his cell phone without at least <i>knowing</i>--

<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[cuts him off]</i> What? Sorry, I'm in a literal bell jar of baby noises. I think they need to eat. Are you hungry?

<dl><dd> MATT: Let me call you back.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt hangs up, and Valerie hands him a map, which he opens on his desk]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: This is the highway system between Grantville and New Orleans. Stefan's on his way there now, and Rayna is no doubt breathing down his neck. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: Tell me you at least appreciate the irony. I need your help because there's no Sheriff's department left. The reason there's no Sheriff's department is because <i>you</i> killed all the sheriffs.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Then yes, I <i>do</i> appreciate the irony. Just as I hope you appreciate that I helped Caroline deliver her babies and that I am here because I am desperate to keep Stefan alive.

<dl><dd> DAMON: You don't want to do that. I have a way to take down Rayna, but it requires him to come to me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Well, that might take a while. He's in New Orleans.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> Doubtful. We only go to New Orleans for crappy booze and Klaus blood. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: There's a bar there. The St. James Infirmary. It's considered a safe house for supernatural travelers. Oscar came upon it when he was looking for the Phoenix Stone. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sighs]</i> Fine. Just tell him to pack it up, huff it back to Virginia to a pile of bricks called The Armory.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie's eyes widen in alarm]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Did you just say "The Armory?"
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yes, I did. As a matter of fact, I've said that word more times today than I have in my entire life.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[urgently]</i> Get out of there, Damon. <i>Now</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Why?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: The Armory is a black hole of lies. They once tricked us into using Beau as bait in exactly the same fashion use Stefan. And they were more than happy to let Rayna bury her sword in his heart as long as they could put her in one of their cages. I <i>promise</i> you, they will do the same to Stefan.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sighs]</i> Well, I don't have another option at the moment, Valerie.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[frustrated]</i> Yeah? Well, whose fault is that? Look, the best way you can help Stefan is to keep your mouth shut and stop making things worse.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon hangs up with a scowl, though he seems to be taking her words to heart]</i>

</p><p><i>[Inside, Enzo is standing near a small table with several decanters full of various types of liquor while Bonnie talks to him. She, too, seems to be skeptical about The Armory]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: So, this faceless, so-called "Armory" claims to know where you come from?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: I find Rayna Cruz, they fill in the blanks.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: And, if you have to lie, or hurt your friends, or screw anyone over in the process, so be it, right?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[angrily]</i> I was sent to the workhouse at the age of four, with a concept of family so limited I actually convinced myself that an Italian line cook was my father. By fourteen, I was out on the streets. By twenty-seven, I was dead. That is it. That is the <i>sum total</i> of my life as a human. I know how to comfort myself, live off scraps, and catch disease. The rest? You know, love, relationships, family... These are things I know <i>nothing</i> about. This is what the Armory can provide me. So, will I do whatever it takes for answers? In a heartbeat.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Damon walks in and joins them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Flag on the play. Like an idiot, Stefan didn't renew the minutes on his cell phone. We'll call you when we connect. Come on Bon, I want to beat traffic.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: You know where he is?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yeah, I do, Enzo. I also know that you allowed me to believe Elena was dead so I'd help you kill Rayna, who's already escaped your custody once. Then, you tricked me into saving your ass, which resulted in Rayna getting this stupid sword, and now I have Stefan's 1863 Siphon-crush telling me that you all are shady people. So, Bon-Bon here and I are gonna go cook up a Plan B. But, thanks anyway.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Damon is shot in the chest with a vervain dart, and when he collapses to the floor, Bonnie realizes that Enzo has a dart gun in his hands and looks at him in horror]</i>

<dl><dd> DAMON: Oh... Ohhhh...

<p><i>[He rolls over and struggles to get to his feet, barely able to stand, and when he looks around the room, he finds Tyler laying unconscious in the gurney next to him, hooked up to a beeping heart monitor. Damon looks stunned]</i>

<dl><dd> DAMON: Lockwood?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, Enzo's voice is heard behind him as he enters the room through the door with the green digital lock]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Found him where you left him, in a pool of his own blood. Poor bloke's been in a coma ever since.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Why the hell is he here?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: He's an associate of ours, actually. We take care of our own.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: ...That's why you have Elena.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Cookie for you. No, it turns out Tyler made contact with the Armory during his hunter sojourns. So, when Matt Donovan needed help with the vampire problem in Mystic Falls, he called Tyler, who then called the Armory, thinking they'd put me away for good. Little did he know... they wanted me to work for them instead.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: So, here we all are-- in a cell. That's how you take care of people?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Oh, don't worry about Tyler. We're simply keeping him alive until his werewolf transformation stirs him awake and heals him up. Shouldn't be long now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[confused]</i> I'm sorry... <i>what</i>?!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo walks toward the door to unlock it before walking out and continuing his conversation with Damon through the glass window]</i>

<dl><dd> ENZO: Oh, did I forget to mention that tonight's a full moon? Well, look-- you're welcome to watch the show with me, on this side of the glass. Just give me Stefan's location.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Thanks. But you know I'm a sucker for the front row.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[shrugs]</i> Suit yourself.

</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Damon put Tyler in a coma. Bit of a hallucination mix-up that resulted in Damon introducing Tyler's skull to the pavement several times. If the Armory hadn't found him, he'd be a vegetable... or dead.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[incredulously]</i> Ice? You knock me out, then offer me ice? What's <i>wrong</i> with you? Where's Damon?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: I locked him in a room with Tyler, on a full moon. Yes, you heard that right-- your bestie, your sidekick, your humanity project. The man who spins your moral compass in a tizzy. If he doesn't give over Stefan's location by the wolfing hour, he's a dead man. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie furiously attempts to attack Enzo with a bone-breaking spell]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[chants] Phasmatos ossox!</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Ohh... What did you do to me? Why won't my magic work?

<dl><dd> VALERIE: Stefan, thank God! Have you made it to New Orleans?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Let's just say I wore out my welcome. I'm back on the road, and, in a shocking turn of events, Damon needs my help.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[anxiously]</i> What are you talking about? Worry about yourself. You need to go back. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Matt walks in with urgent news]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Dispatch just put an APB on a speeding motorcyclist traveling east on Highway 90. Woman, meets Rayna's description, driving like a maniac. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[to Stefan]</i> Do you hear that? Avoid 90.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Yeah, a little late for that...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[alarmed]</i> Where are you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Traveling east on 90. I'll call you later.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan hangs up and keeps a look out with his rear-view mirror. Valerie, hanging up her own phone, gives Matt a panicked look]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[On I-90, Stefan continues to drive before eventually taking a right turn. When he flips open his burner phone, he finds that he has no cell phone service and sighs as he throws it back onto the passenger seat. He's driving what looks like a back road near the Bayou when suddenly, his tires explode with a loud bang, forcing Stefan to come to a screeching halt. He skids off the road and nearly misses hitting a trailer home near Hayley's former shack before stopping and getting out of his car to look around]</i>
</p><p><i>[He sees one of Rayna's wooden arrows impaling his left front tire and looks around to see where she is. Just then, she appears in front of him, shooting him in the leg with another bolt from her crossbow before reloading it and shooting another one into his right shoulder. He falls back against his Jeep, and Rayna tosses aside her crossbow in favor of pulling her Phoenix Sword out of the scabbard strapped to her back as she walks toward him]</i>
</p><p><i>[He falls to one knee, allowing Rayna to kick him flat on his back on the ground as she pins him down with her leg and drives the blade of her sword toward his heart, but he takes the blade in his hands and uses all of his strength to keep her from plunging it into his chest. His hands start to gush blood from the effort, and Rayna uses all the strength she can muster to fight against him until finally, Klaus appears behind him and backhands Rayna so hard in the chest with a crowbar that she flies several dozen yards backward into the nearby woods, her sword flying far away from her to the right. Klaus reaches down with his hand, which Stefan takes so he can pull him to his feet. He gives Klaus a shocked expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What are you doing here?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KLAUS: The right thing... I hope. She's dead for now. We have to go.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: We need to grab her before she comes back to life.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KLAUS: Stefan, you are trespassing on dangers ground. Trust me-- 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Klaus gestures toward the woods behind them, where the eyes of a dozen growling werewolves are staring back at them near where Rayna landed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> KLAUS: This is werewolf territory. Let's go.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Klaus vamp-speeds away, and Stefan reluctantly chases after him as well]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="THE_ARMORY_HEADQUARTERS_4"> THE ARMORY HEADQUARTERS </span></h2>
<p><i>[Tyler, still in the middle of his transformation, reaches up to lean against the gurney, and Damon points his makeshift weapon at him and gives him a wary look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Easy, boy. I do <i>not</i> want to kill you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: Why? 'Cause Elena will dump your ass?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Tyler's bones continue to snap and break]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[shrugs]</i> And it would be a waste of a perfectly good IV stand.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: <i>[gasps in pain]</i> If it's not me, it's going to be somebody else, Damon. There's no way in hell you're lasting sixty years without royally screwing up.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Tyler screams as his bones keep breaking, and Damon tries to calm him down]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Bonnie should be here any second--
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: That's what I'm talking about. You open that door, and I'll kill her, too. There's always going to be something else. Your friends-- <i>my friends</i>-- they'll keep risking their lives trying to save you until they're all dead. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, Bonnie arrives with Enzo's severed hand in her own]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Looks like you could use a hand.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She's about to hold the hand in front of the scanner when Damon frantically stops her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Bonnie, wait! Don't!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I <i>need</i> to get you out of here.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Bonnie, listen-- if you open that door, Tyler will kill you, too.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[scoffs]</i> I'm not going to let you die in there.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: This is my mess. Go. Go!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Tyler's eyes glow gold again, and his fangs have come out as he roars at Damon and Bonnie. Bonnie ignores Damon's instructions and opens the door just as Tyler lunges for them, so Damon turns and keeps himself in front of Bonnie as Tyler tackles him, pushing them both out into the hallway. Bonnie picks up the IV stand and holds it above Tyler's head as he tries to bite Damon as Damon holds him back as best he can]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Tyler! Tyler, stop!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: <i>[growls]</i> Bonnie, get the hell out of here!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When Bonnie tries to hit him, Tyler spins and grabs the IV stand before hitting Bonnie so hard with it that her skull smashes against the window of the cell. She hits it with such force that her head leaves a bloody smear on the glass as she collapses onto the floor, and Damon roars in fury]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: NOO!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He glares at Tyler, who is so shocked by what he's done that his werewolf eyes and fangs have shifted back]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[furiously]</i> Get out of here, or I will <i>kill</i> you!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Tyler rushes away without another word, and Damon rushes toward Bonnie to feed her his blood]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[panicked]</i> Okay. You're okay. Here you go.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He bites his wrist and puts it to her mouth, but she's barely conscious enough to drink it, and Damon becomes even more horrified when it doesn't seem to be working]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You're not healing. Why aren't you healing?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He pulls his wrist away, and Bonnie remains motionless, so he tries to feed her more blood as he pleads with her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Bonnie, hey! Bon! 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When this doesn't work, Damon hesitates for a moment before picking Bonnie up bridal-style and carrying her away]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="THE_ARMORY_HEADQUARTERS_5"> THE ARMORY HEADQUARTERS </span></h2>
<p><i>[Enzo awakens in the room that Damon and Tyler just broke out of, as the smear of blood from Bonnie's head remains on the glass. When he looks down, he sees that his hand has been reattached and is wrapped in tape where they sewed it back on. After a moment, Alex walks in to speak with him with a smile]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALEX: Found that laying around and thought you might need it. Guess that's the last time we let you watch the house. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[annoyed]</i> Actually, it's the last-last time for anything. I'm through working for free. Catch the Huntress yourself.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: You said you wanted to know where you came from. We just needed you to prove it. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: For four months? Four months of learning your mission statements, helping you track this woman with postcards and lies, scouring the globe? Four months that brought me <i>nothing</i>! No answers. No family.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo sighs in frustration]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Consider our deal terminated.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: Your family is <i>here</i>, Lorenzo.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alex takes a deep breath before she continues]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALEX: Your father founded the Armory. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[in disbelief]</i> My father?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: This estate is where he lived and died. What he left behind is your birthright.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[scoffs]</i> What he left behind was me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: Believe me, I know the feeling. Until Tyler Lockwood called us, I didn't know I had any family left either. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: What are you talking about?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: My name is Alexandria St. John. I'm your family, Lorenzo.

<p><i>[Caroline has just walked into the kitchen of the new house Alaric bought, which is lit only by some candles spread across the counter, where some fast food is waiting for them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: The girls are asleep. Furniture is <i>en route</i>, electricity will be on by tomorrow morning, and I am <i>starving</i>. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She picks up a burger on the counter and bites into it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Mmmm. Mmm, did you get a chance to look over the list of nannies?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: I did. Um, I set up an interview with the one that you rated at, uh, 89.75%.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Tracy? Good, she was my first choice, too. And, I can compel her to lower her fee, if you want...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: No, I-I don't think that will be necessary. I mean, really, between scoring this house and actually having the babies, you've gone above and beyond.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[awkwardly]</i> Well, then I guess my work here is done...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She laughs nervously and hesitates before continuing]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: I think I'll stay the night, if that's okay with you. Just to make sure that the electrician doesn't burn down the house tomorrow morning.

<p><i>[Bonnie has been admitted to the hospital, where she's unconscious and hooked up to an oxygen tank and a heart monitor. Damon is at her bedside, holding her hand and trying his best to wake her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[whispers]</i> Bon. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When Bonnie remains unconscious, Damon sighs]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Fine. Be that way. Ignore me. By the way, once whatever crap Enzo gave you is out of your system and magic works on you again, I'm going to give you my blood and heal you, okay? But, in the meantime, there's something I want you to know. You are a <i>terrible</i> friend. You know that? Do you have any idea what I'd have to go through if you'd have died today? Huh? Years of guilt. Crippling, self-loathing guilt. Not to mention the resentment I'd feel if I was forced to break in a new drinking buddy...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon pauses before he continues]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You're not supposed to die for me, Bon. Neither is my brother. But, no matter what I say, or how hard I try and drill it into your skulls, you're not going to stop trying. Which is why I have to take myself out of the equation. It all ends tomorrow. You'll never have to worry about me again.

<dl><dd> KLAUS: Do you love her? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Caroline? Why? Do you still have feelings for her?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KLAUS: I have far too many complicated women in my life already. Caroline is the reason the tip of Rayna's blade ended up in your flesh, isn't she? You were protecting her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[sighs]</i> No. I was protecting Damon.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KLAUS: Then let her go. Let her go, or spend an eternity of sacrificing everything good you have with her for your brother. Believe me, I've spent an eternity watching Elijah do the same for me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[frowns]</i> You missed the exit.
