<p><i>[Rayna has just awakened naked in the woods of the Bayou, surrounded by smoldering dead leaves around her that were set ablaze when her old body burst into flames and regenerated. She rolls out a crick in her neck and looks around to find a bunch of clothes hanging on a clothesline next to a tent, which she steals and puts on. She finds her sword laying nearby on the ground and picks it up with a determined expression as she makes her way out of the woods]</i>

<p><i>[A currently unidentifiable woman is walking down the street with her hood up when suddenly, a very muscular and intimidating vampire vamp-speeds behind her before starting to follow her at a human pace from a short distance away. The woman is listening to loud music through earbuds which are connected to the phone in her back pocket, and she appears to be oblivious to the man behind her. Finally, she stops and turns around to face him, revealing that it's Deputy Penny Ares, Matt's friend, dressed in civilian clothing]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PENNY: What do you want?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VAMPIRE: Just looking for a bite.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The man's fangs and vampire eyes come out, and Penny pretends to be afraid]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PENNY: Oh God. You're a vampire.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VAMPIRE: And you're lunch.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Before the vampire can attack her, however, he's staked from behind by Matt, who has one of Alaric's stake-shooting guns in his hands. Penny removes her earbuds and gives him a look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PENNY: Shouldn't he be turning all gray?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt cocks and reloads his gun, which is still aimed at the vampire, who is now on his knees on the ground and is gasping and gagging as though the stake hit him in the lungs rather than the heart]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PENNY: All the other ones turned gray. Unless, of course, you missed.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[offended]</i> How many vampires have I killed in the last few days?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> PENNY: <i>[shrugs]</i> A lot. But who knows how many you would have killed if you hadn't missed a third of the time?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: He's got a thick jacket on. I can't exactly see where his heart is.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> PENNY: Outerwear? That's your excuse?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Penny pulls out her gun and shoots him in the chest, right in the heart, killing him instantly before looking at Matt with a cocky grin]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: You gonna stand there and brag all day, or are you gonna help me load him into the car? We gotta get him out of here before the--
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, Krystal, Damon's one-night-stand from <a href="/wiki/This_Woman%27s_Work" title="This Woman's Work">This Woman's Work</a>, appears behind them with at least another half-dozen of her fellow vampires standing around her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> KRYSTAL: Julian's other vampires get suspicious? Too late.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt reaches for his stake-shooting gun, and Krystal sneers at him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> KRYSTAL: Touch it and die. Actually, why don't you die anyway?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Before any of the vampires can react, they're all shot down, one after another after another, by Rayna, who has her own wooden stake-shooting shotgun that she uses to kill all of the vampires. When Krystal turns and gapes at her in shock, Rayna shoots her too. Matt and Penny look stunned by the sight of her as she steps over their bodies to walk toward them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PENNY: You saved our lives.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Yes, I did. Which means you owe me one. You ever heard of a vampire named Stefan Salvatore?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt looks around for a moment, clearly torn about how to answer that question]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ON_THE_ROAD_.2F_HERB_STOREHOUSE"> ON THE ROAD / HERB STOREHOUSE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Stefan is dabbing what remains of Freya's herbal poultice to block Rayna's powers from being able to track him. When Valerie watches him with concern, Stefan gives her a look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You mind just paying attention to the road a little bit more?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Well, I could, but then I might miss the world's largest ball of yarn coming up on the left... And <i>there</i> it goes. Not quite sure what I was expecting.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Well, that was the last of Freya's herbs, which means its only a matter of time before they wear off and Rayna can track me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Good thing we're on our way to get more.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[sarcastically]</i> Are we? Because it sure feels like we're on our way to the world's largest waste of time.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: We have to take back roads to avoid being spotted.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[gives her a look]</i> Mmhmm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: You've only been running a few days, Stefan. Think of it like it's an adventure!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[scoffs]</i> I don't want an adventure. I just want to get these herbs and have a nice, quiet, home-cooked meal with my girlfriend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Then do what? Pay bills? Talk about your day? Ugh.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Well, you don't actually <i>enjoy</i> this, do you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Mmm. There's a certain constant in the lack of constants. And, once you accept it, it's invigorating.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan stares at her for a long moment before turning into a driveway]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: We're here.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[They pull into a clearing next to what looks like an outdoor greenhouse of some kind]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: What is this place?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[They get out of the car and walk toward the greenhouse]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Well, according to Freya, all the herbs witches use are stored here. Just in case something happens to them.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>All</i> of them?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Yeah.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[They make it to the greenhouse, which is an open-air garden full of hundreds of different herbs and plants]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Well, I hope you know what this particular herb looks like.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: And why is that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Because witches are <i>very</i> fond of their herbs.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks overwhelmed by all the varieties of herbs around them]</i>

<p><i>[Bonnie's phone rings, and she picks it up off the table to check it. However, when she sees its Enzo, she mutes the ringer and sets it back down, just as Damon walks into the room as he pours the contents of a flask into a cup of coffee]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Oh, good! You're up. How's Bonica-magica?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie turns so she's sitting with her legs dangling over the edge of the bed and makes a face at him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Not great, but... good enough to make sure you never call me that again.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[chuckles]</i> Oooh...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Someone's cheery.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, I'm a man with a plan!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Which is...?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[evasively]</i> A secret.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Does it have to do with killing Rayna the Huntress?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[smirks]</i> I'll never tell! ...But, yes.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Good. How can I help?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sighs]</i> You can't. This is the Damon-only show.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: It's Damon versus Cray-na, because that one gets you right back in Hell. You don't even know how to <i>kill</i> her.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon scoffs just as Bonnie's phone rings, which gives her an idea]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: But, you know who might?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[frowns]</i> Don't even <i>think</i> about it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Enzo's been calling me non-stop-- probably to apologize for yesterday. I bet if I go back to the Armory, I can find out more info.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon snatches the phone out of her hands, hangs up on Enzo, and sets it back down on the table, causing Bonnie to scoff and give him a dirty look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: What the hell?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Look around, Bonnie. I'm not here for the filmy hospital pudding. You almost <i>died</i> in that place, and I'll <i>never</i> let that happen again.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon gives Bonnie a serious look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Promise me you will stay out of this, Bon. No one needs to get hurt for me anymore. I can handle Rayna.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie seems surprised and confused by this reaction as she watches Damon turn and walk away]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="MYSTIC_GRILL"> MYSTIC GRILL </span></h2>
<p><i>[Rayna is holding the tip of her sword to the heart of one of Julian's vampires who is tied to a chair at the Grill, while Matt aims his stake-gun at the vampire as back-up for Rayna while Penny watches]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Here's where we stand-- I've killed five of your friends because they couldn't tell me where Stefan Salvatore was. I sure hope you can.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Rayna turns back to Matt and Penny]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: You two, watch and learn. The key is to treat them like you would a wild animal. Respecting the danger, but recognizing that they're beneath you, and that they serve a purpose. For example, this one will provide information.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She turns back to the vampire, who looks resigned to his fate]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Tell me <i>everything</i> you know about Stefan Salvatore, or I'll send you to Hell for eternity.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Damon appears behind them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Barking up the wrong vampire, there, sister. Stefan's antisocial. Not many friends. Actually, no friends at all. But, I hear he has a <i>very</i> handsome and charming brother. You might want to talk to him.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Yeah, a <i>stupid</i> brother. Seems foolish of you to come back here.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I know, right? To be honest... I'm not that brave. However, I did have a <i>shockingly</i> effective ally tell me that you were here.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt takes his gun off of the vampire and shoots Rayna in the gut with it, incapacitating her long enough to yank her heart out, killing her and yanking her sword out of her hands before she falls to the floor. Penny looks at Matt in horror as she rushes over to check on her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PENNY: What the hell did you do?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[uncomfortably]</i> It's okay. Damon's a...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Aw, you almost said "friend." How sweet!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[sighs]</i> His <i>brother</i> is a friend, and that's the only reason I'm helping him.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> And the world yawned.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He gestures toward the tied-up vampire]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Get rid of this thing.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[annoyed]</i> Anything else?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yeah-- you know where I can get a buzz-saw?
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="MYSTIC_FALLS_WOODS"> MYSTIC FALLS WOODS </span></h2>
<p><i>[Damon is sitting in a lawn chair next to the well near the old Lockwood property, wearing a bloody apron over his clothes as he sips bourbon from his flask. Next to him are a pile of weapons, presumably from the throne in the boarding house. The camera pans down into the now-empty well, where Rayna's body has been dismembered and put into individual garbage bags, which all suddenly burst into flames as she regenerates and resurrects herself. When Damon sees the smoke billowing from inside the well, he rolls his eyes and groans in annoyance as he takes another sip from his flask]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Ugh. Here we go.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Rayna has just regenerated, and she is standing naked in the well, which is just a few rolls her neck as her joints crack loudly. The well is only a few feet taller than she is, but she's still too short to get out without assistance. She takes a deep breath as Damon, annoyed, grabs a bunch of clothing from the ground and throws them down to her without even getting out of his chair. Rayna frowns in concern]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: They're my girlfriend's. And, given the fact that you two look exactly alike, you should be able to fit into them.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: <i>[sarcastically]</i> What's next? "It puts the lotion in the basket?"
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: It wouldn't have to if it just <i>stayed dead</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon sighs wearily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Bit of a pickle here, Ray. I got big plans.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Rayna scoffs as she puts on her clothes, and Damon continues to sit in his chair to give her privacy]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: You buy a time share?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Kind of, actually. But, I can't go on vacation until I do something about you. See, I can't relax and sip Mai Tais while you're out hunting my brother. And, every time I kill you, you just Phoenix back to life.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon sighs again]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: It's a dill.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Well, why don't you just let me kill your brother, then you can do whatever you want?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Tempting. Truly. But, I kind of owe him.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon finally stands and walks over to the well, still holding his flask and wearing his bloody apron]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Family, am I right? That's why you and I have to put our heads together and come up with a Plan B.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: <i>[incredulously]</i> You want me to go against my very <i>nature</i> because he's your family?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[mockingly]</i> Pretty much.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Funny thing is... Family's the very reason this is my nature. My father envisioned a world without vampires. I will not <i>rest</i> until I see his vision through.

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="HERB_STOREHOUSE"> HERB STOREHOUSE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Valerie and Stefan are walking around the herb growhouse as they look at all of the plants. Valerie looks a little skeptical of their plan]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: So, what do you propose we do? Rub each one on your wound and hope for the best?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I don't know. You're a witch-- why have <i>you</i> never heard of this?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[As they walk, a figure in what looks like a light brown cloak rushes behind them in a blur]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[shrugs]</i> It is strange. Botanically, I am <i>very</i> well-versed.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[As they walk through the rows of various herbs and flowers, Valerie starts to identify them for Stefan]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: There's wolfsbane. Vervain. Senna. Witch hazel. And this fun little guy...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She points to a plant at the same time Stefan does]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Mmm, that one I know.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie pulls a leaf off of the plant and looks at Stefan in surprise]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: The witchy hallucinogen. The one borderline-recreational herb.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie looks at Stefan, clearly impressed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Stefan, I misjudged you! You actually <i>do</i> have fun.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[gives her a look]</i> I did it <i>once</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[smirks]</i> What was her name?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> Really? There <i>has</i> to be a her?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: With someone like you, there's <i>always</i> a bad influence.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan, slightly amused, turns to keep walking through the aisles]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Well, her name was Rebekah. Let's just say she was a lot to handle.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[They turn down another aisle, and the mysterious cloaked person watching them speeds behind them once again]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[chuckles]</i> 'Course she was. And that's why she's not in the picture. See, you prefer small-town girls who want to settle down. Who are easy to handle.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan makes a face at her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I don't think <i>anyone's</i> ever called Caroline Forbes "easy to handle." And, as thrilling as this therapy session is...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan comes up to a row of herbs and frowns when he sees a section that is empty, save for a few dead leaves and roots]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I think I found it. Or, where it used to be.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[sighs]</i> Lovely. A dead end.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, a mist starts to come out of the sprinklers over the plants, and Stefan looks at Valerie in concern]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What is it?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, a middle-aged woman in a light brown shirt whose face is covered in scabbed-over burns appears in front of them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> SCABBED WOMAN: Night, night.

<dl><dd> ENZO: You actually came. I'm shocked.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie rolls her eyes at him before glancing at his arm]</i>

<dl><dd> BONNIE: So, did it grow back, or...?

<dl><dd> ENZO: No, actually.

<dl><dd> ENZO: I had to reattach it. But thank you for your concern.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Well, at least you're thinking of me. I take it you received my messages?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I did. And, I'm not stupid enough to think that your apologies were anything other than a tactic to get you here. But, here I am.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie circles around Enzo menacingly as he rolls his eyes in exasperation]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Fair warning-- if you try to disable my magic again, you'll <i>wish</i> I only cut off your hand.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[laughs wryly]</i> I see Damon's obscenity is rubbing off on you. It's quite pathetic, really. You know, you following him around like some high-school groupie.

<dl><dd> ALEX: I'm sorry for Enzo's behavior yesterday.

<p><i>[Rayna frowns, just as Damon vamp-speeds toward her, but Rayna kicks the ground, causing Damon's shovel to pop upward into her hand so she can swing it at Damon. He manages to dodge the hit, but he ducks so hard that he falls backward onto the ground. Rayna stands over him and sneers]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Don't say I never offered you anything.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She goes to use the end of the shovel to cut Damon's head off, but he rolls away at vampire speed before getting back on his feet]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, if I could kill you, this would be a much fairer fight.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Your brother's dead, no matter what. All you've done by saving my life is gotten yourself killed.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She breaks the shovel handle over her knee, and Damon frowns]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Don't worry. I don't miss.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, out of breath from the exertion of preventing Rayna from killing him, pants loudly, but before she can throw the stake, she's suddenly shot in the neck with a tranquilizer dart. Her eyes open in alarm, but she doesn't even have time to process what just happened before she's shot in the back with another dozen darts by at least as many Armory soldiers, who have just surrounded her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LEAD ARMORY SOLDIER: Fire!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Rayna turns toward the men and women behind her, just as she's shot in the chest with another dozen darts. She growls and glares at them as she turns back toward Damon, looking woozy]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[impressed]</i> Apparently, neither do they.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Despite her best efforts, Rayna succumbs to the effects of the tranquilizers and falls to her knees before collapsing face-first onto the ground as the Armory soldiers swarm around her]</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Ah. Looking for a bottle to celebrate? I gotta say, I'm impressed. Got your text. I didn't think you'd be able to kill her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[hesitantly]</i> Actually, my <i>exact</i> message read: "She's taken care of."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[confused]</i> Yeah, she's taken care of.

<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[awkwardly]</i> Yeah...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon makes a face, and Stefan frowns as he walks toward him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What? So, you didn't kill her?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I did. A number of times. As it turns out, she only has eight lives. The last one's the problem. Turns out that if she dies for good, everyone with that scar on your chest does, as well.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[stunned]</i> So, we <i>can't</i> kill her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No. But, the good news is, the Armory has her, and they're not gonna let her escape.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Except for that time they did.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sighs]</i> Look, I know it's not ideal, okay? It's what we got.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon takes his drink and starts to walk out of the room when Stefan suddenly calls out to him, sounding defeated]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Caroline's staying in Dallas with Ric and the kids.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Sorry to hear that, brother. But, I saw that coming.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[scoffs]</i> You don't get it, do you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[frustrated]</i> What?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: As long as I have this scar, Rayna will hunt me. This isn't about just you and me anymore-- there's kids involved. I'm not gonna put them in danger, which means that I can't be with my girlfriend as long as Rayna is alive. And you just told me she can never died, so we have to figure out another way to get rid of her, or we need to get rid of this scar.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[shrugs]</i> That's a good plan... for you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon picks up two fancy envelopes, each sealed with a wax stamp, and shoves them against Stefan's chest. Stefan frowns in confusion]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What is this?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sighs]</i> We both know the last few months have been impossible for me. I've been walking a tightrope. Falling off <i>constantly</i>. I'm not a good brother when I'm not with Elena, and when I'm not a good brother, people get hurt.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks at Damon, both horrified and furious at Damon for what he knows is coming]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: So, you're just gonna run away?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Nope. I'm gonna stay in one place. Desiccated, right next to her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[angrily]</i> Yeah. I saved your life-- time and time again. I <i>chose</i> you. I sacrificed <i>everyone</i> and <i>everything</i> for you. You're just gonna turn your back on me now?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sadly]</i> We're vampires, Stefan. It's temporary. I'll see you again.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon turns to leave again, and Stefan loses his temper]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Listen to me. If there's even a <i>fraction</i> of you that cares about me-- your brother, your <i>family</i>-- you will <i>not</i> walk out that door.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon looks pained to have to do this, but doesn't turn back]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Save a good bottle of that bourbon for me, brother. We're gonna need it to sort all this out in about sixty years.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon walks out the front door and closes it behind him, leaving a terribly hurt and angry Stefan behind]</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Really not the best time, Matt.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: This won't take long.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I don't want to have to kick you out of here, but I will.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[sighs]</i> Yeah, I know you will. And there's nothing I can do to stop you-- because you're a vampire, and I'm a human. I've been thinking a lot about that lately. About my place in this town. My <i>home</i>. Whenever vampires are here, humans will always be at their mercy. Whatever laws we pass, you can break. Whatever lives we build, you can destroy. We don't stand a chance against you. That stops today.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks at Matt, both exasperated and offended by Matt's attitude, and stands so he can walk toward him. Matt gulps nervously, mildly afraid that Stefan might hurt him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Excuse me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: Vampires need to leave Mystic Falls... for good. All of you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[scoffs]</i> Look, I appreciate whatever moral crisis you're going through right now, but this is my home. I'm not going anywhere.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt sighs and pulls a flash-drive out of his pocket]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: This is footage from the Grill today... of Damon doing some <i>very</i> not-human things to Rayna. I've got footage of you, too. Hundreds of hours from the town surveillance system. Now... I don't want to show it to anyone or expose you...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[angrily]</i> You threatening me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: Yeah, I am. And I hate that. I hate that I have to threaten my friend because he's a vampire. I hate that I'm friends with vampires at all. This isn't about me. Or you. This is about our home, which has been destroyed time and time again. This is the <i>only</i> way to break that cycle. You have until the end of the day. Damon, too.

</p><p><i>[In DALLAS, TEXAS, Stefan is sitting in the driver's seat of his stolen Jeep, looking overwhelmed and upset. He looks over at Alaric's house, where inside, Alaric has just come into the kitchen to find one of the letters Damon wrote next to a new bottle of bourbon. He opens the letter to read it, and Damon narrates the letter in voiceover]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] Hey, buddy. So, I know this is a crappy way to do this, but... hey, I'm a crappy person, so I guess it fits.</i>

<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] By the time you read this, I'll be desiccated in a coffin next to Elena. And I won't wake up until she does, so I guess this might be my official goodbye. I'm not gonna get lame or mushy, but... You deserve the truth.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Outside Alaric's house in DALLAS, Stefan sits in his Jeep and looks depressed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] I'm telling Stefan that the world is a better place without an Elena-less Damon. That it was best for everyone that I was gone. I'm sure he'll see through that, because, to be completely honest, I don't give a damn about the world.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan takes a deep breath and gets out of his Jeep as he walks toward the house]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] The truth is, I'm not in a good spot. Hell, I'm miserable. And I have been ever since she left me.</i>

Alaric, looking sad, walks over and takes one of the babies so he can hold her, and when Caroline giggles happily, Alaric can't resist but smile as well despite his sadness about Damon. From the window, Stefan watches them and realizes that Caroline is happy here]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] But now, I do. And now that I know that feeling... to live without it? There's no point. </i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan, now totally devastated, turns and flattens his back against the wall next to the window so they can't see them.

He types his reply-- "Let's keep moving."]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] So, that's it. Nice knowing you.</i>

<dl><dd> BONNIE: You weren't even gonna say <i>goodbye</i>?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon turns to face her, looking shocked that she's there]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Enzo told me you asked him for Elena's coffin. He told me what you were planning. I didn't believe him. I thought... "If Damon desiccates until Elena wakes up, I'll never see him again."

</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: "He'd never do that."

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> Of course, Bonnie. We don't actively try and kill each other anymore.

<dl><dd> BONNIE: Are we friends?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon doesn't know what to say and struggles to find the words]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I know why you wanted to do this in a letter-- so you could desiccate in peace, imagining whatever reaction you wanted. Me reading it and thinking, "Huh. I'm really gonna miss him." Well, too bad, because that's <i>not</i> my reaction-- this is. I am <i>not</i> okay with this decision. I'm <i>not</i> okay with you choosing yourself. And I'm <i>not</i> okay with never seeing you-- my <i>best friend</i>-- ever again.

</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: This hurts me. This <i>hurts</i>... this <i>hurts</i> me...

<p><i>[Bonnie shakes her head and backs away from him when he starts to walk toward her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: No. No. You don't get to say goodbye.

<p><i>[Bonnie angrily turns and walks away without another word, and Damon sighs, his arms still spread from his attempt to embrace her. As he watches her leave, his own eyes fill with tears as well. After a moment, he looks over at his coffin before walking toward the door to the storage locker and takes one last look at the illuminated Brooklyn Bridge before he closes the door. He then gets into his coffin, giving Elena's own coffin one last look before he nods to himself, lays down, and closes the lid. Inside, Damon visibly begins to desiccate, his skin turning gray as his blood vessels enlarge across his face and hands]</i>
