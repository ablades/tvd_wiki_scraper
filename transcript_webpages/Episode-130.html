<dl><dd> Stefan: Adorable. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(He tosses the angel over his shoulder, where it shatters on the floor)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>(suspiciously)</i> Okay, so I'll bite. So, you hunt me down in a bar-- where I am perfectly content feeding on the wait staff-- so you can whine to me about how your mom is a bitch--
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>(cuts her off)</i> What kind of mother doesn't love her own children?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Caroline seductively approaches him)</i>

<dl><dd> Stefan: ...Convince her that my humanity is still off. I'll tell her that my run-in with our mother had no effect on me, and I want to keep the party going. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: <i>(amused)</i> Ah, look at that! Saint Stefan has a plan. Let me guess-- whoever's holding the kitten gets to talk about their feelings?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Torture her until she breaks. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: <i>(impressed)</i> Sold! 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: So, do I need to remind you two that the last time Caroline thought that we were trying to flip her switch, she went on a killing spree? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Well, she's not gonna find out this time.

<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>(on the phone)</i> Hey. Can I get some towels set up to the room, please? Thank you. <i>(He hangs up and turns to Caroline)</i> I'm hungry, so I figure we can eat whoever brings them up.

<dl><dd> Elena: Fine, say she believes you-- How do you know she's gonna even want to see you again?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: <i>(smirks)</i> Oh, she'll want to see him.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>(embarrassed)</i> Damon... Shut up!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: <i>(gleefully)</i> I mean, it's a bit of a tricky bet for you, isn't it, brother? She's gonna expect a lot. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: <i>(confused)</i> Okay, what am I missing here?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>(quickly)</i> Nothing. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: <i>(gasps in realization)</i> Hang on a second. Did you and Caroline--
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Damon is so amused that he's dancing by swinging his arm around and rocking his hips)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Do it? <i>(He pops the "p" on his next statement)</i> Yep! 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: <i>(shocked)</i> Oh... This was after she flipped...? <i>(She notices Stefan's look of total humiliation and stops herself) --Never mind...</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: It's not exactly how I wanted things to go down, but I can't change it now, so can we just drop it? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Okay. Sore subject. Understood. So, what do we do once you earn her trust?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: We drain her of her blood, make her weak, and then bombard her with everything she used to care about-- memories of who she was, her friendships, her mom. <i>(He turns to Elena)</i> Did you bring it? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Yes. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She pulls out an envelope from her bag and hands it over to Stefan)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: What is that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Caroline got rid of everything from her former life. Her mom had sent this letter, intending for it to arrive after she died, which it did, but Caroline had already flipped her switch.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: It could work. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Sure. Unless she wants sexy-Stefan-time instead of an assault on Memory Lane.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>(determined)</i> I'm not gonna let that happen. 
</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> Caroline: Now what are you doing?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Just making us some drinks.

<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>(hums happily)</i> Such a gentleman.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Mmmm...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>**Music Continues**</i>
</p><p><i>(Caroline kisses the side of his face affectionately until she hears the knock at the door)</i> 
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Dinner...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She turns and walks to the door and opens it, though she's completely stunned to see Damon standing in front of her, holding two folded towels in his hands and smiling patronizingly)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Towels!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(He holds up the two folded towels in one hand, and in the other, he holds up a vervain dart-gun, which he uses to shoot Caroline several times in the torso. Caroline gasps in surprise and falls unconscious to the floor. Once she's passed out, Damon walks into the room and approaches Stefan, who looks guilty, before tossing the towels onto the floor)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Sure you want to do this?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>(sighs)</i> Let's just get it over with.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Damon shrugs before shooting Stefan with the vervain dart-gun as well. Stefan gasps in discomfort before passing out on the floor)</i>

<p><i>(The sun shines into the room through an open window with bars attached to the inside. Caroline awakens on a bed, only to realize that her wrists had been slit while she was unconscious, causing her to bleed out all over the bed. When she looks down at Stefan, she finds him sprawled on the floor, half-leaning on against the bed, and with his own blood soaking the carpet around him)</i>

<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>(sighs weakly)</i> Stefan? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Yeah?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: What happened?

<p><i>(Bonnie walks down the busy campus hallway as she flips through a book. Suddenly, Damon appears, and she looks up at the sound of his voice. Once he approaches her, he hands her a coffee)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Hello.

<p><i>(Bonnie takes the coffee from him)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Hey. This is a surprise.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Well, you know, I was just in the hood. I thought I might stop by and bring my friend a little morning pick-me-up. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(They continue talking as they walk down the hallway) </i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Thanks. What is this? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Uh, it's a mocha-latte-frappi-somethin'. <i>(Bonnie gives him an amused look, and he shrugs awkwardly)</i> I dont know-- I guessed.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Clearly. So Elena told me that you guys found Caroline, which is great. Funny enough, she didn't mention anything about a cure for vampirism? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: <i>(worried)</i> Please don't tell me you said anything. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I didn't! Apparently, neither have you. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Well, yeah. Look. I've been busy, you know? My mom's in town. I had to vampire-proof a B &amp; B. Do you have any idea how many people I had to compel to make that happen? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Quite a few, I am assuming... which makes me wonder how you had time to bring your bud a coffee. Hmm? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: You ever hear of April Lyrids? <i>(She stares at him, clearly onfused)</i> Yeah, me neither. Anyway, it's a stupid comet that my mom thinks she's gonna use to pull her friends out of the 1903 prison world. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: <i>(concerned)</i> Okay, but we're not letting her people out. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: <i>(grimaces uncomfortably)</i> Well, I may have reinforced that possibility... when I gave the Ascendant to her for safe-keepings. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: <i>(angry and stunned)</i> You <i>what</i>?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Damon looks around nervously before pulling her into an empty classroom so they can speak privately)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Come here.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(He closes the door behind them) </i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Damon, <i>you</i> were the one that said her friends are vampires who can do <i>magic</i>. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: <i>(knows he messed up)</i> I think the PC term is "witchpire."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: The <i>term</i> is "freaks we've never dealt with before." 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: But it doesn't matter, because she still needs you to do the spell to open up the door to 1903, Bonnie!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: <i>(clearly furious)</i> Oh. So, that means she's gonna come looking for <i>me</i>!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: So we stall her! Look, Lily's like a bill collector. You dodge her calls long enough, she'll leave you alone. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: No, eventually they shut your power off! <i>(She angrily turns away from him and heads to the door before turning around for one last parting word) You better fix this before she becomes my problem. And don't ever show up here pretending to care about me again! </i>

<p><i>(Alaric and Jo, who are on watch duty, are playing a game of cards in the hallway just outside of the room where Stefan and Caroline are locked up)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Jo: Oh. Did I tell you I got us into that cute bakery right off campus? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: <i>(confused)</i> I have no idea what you're talking about. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Jo: To taste wedding cake for our wedding.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: <i>(awkwardly)</i> Oh.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Jo: I don't need to remind you... right around the corner?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Is this where I pretend to care about how our wedding cake tastes?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Jo: I just pulled a crummy all-nighter at a B &amp; B we're supposed to be scouting for the wedding. You can care about cake. Did I mention that the cute bakery is right next door to an even cuter tequila bar? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Mmm... Tequila... My Favorite. <i>(He lays down the cards in his hands)</i> Gin. Again. How many is that? 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Jo smiles and kisses him, and the two engage in a passionate kiss, before she sits on his lap, straddling him as they begin to make out. After a moment, Elena walks in, looking both surprised and uncomfortable) </i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Elena: Oh! Um, ahem. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She clears her throat and the two break apart looking at Elena, then at each other, everyone feeling extremely awkward)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Elena! Hey. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Jo: We were just keeping a really close eye on your friends...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: <i>(clears his throat)</i> Yeah. Real close.

<dl><dd> Elena: <i>(amused)</i> Yeah. I can see that. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Yeah.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Good news! Your shift's over. I'm here to relieve you. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Jo: In that case-- <i>(She stands to her feet)</i>-- I'm just gonna head to the honeymoon suite. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She leaves and walks down the hall. Alaric quickly hops to his feet and addresses Elena) </i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Ahem. Uh, supplies are right here. Uh, cards are right there just in case you get bored. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: <i>(smiles)</i> Supplies. Cards. Got it. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Yeah. Great. So, we'll see you in a few hours. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(He walks past her and follows Jo down the hall to their room)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Elena: Ric? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: <i>(turns back toward her)</i> Yeah?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: It's really nice to see you happy. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Oh, thanks. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(From the other room, they can hear Caroline grunting and groaning miserably)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: I think they're awake, so...Have fun with that. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(The sound of rattling metal is heard from the other room, and Alaric, wanting to get out of there, leaves her to her watch duty. Elena mentally prepares herself for dealing with Caroline)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Elena: Phew. Okay.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(In Stefan and Caroline's room/prison cell, Caroline uses all the strength that she has rattling the bars on the windows, but it is no use. She groans and growls in frustration as she shakes the bars to no avail)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Grr!! Ohh! They vampire-proofed a B &amp; B. How did they even know we were here?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She pants heavily, clearly out of breath from trying so hard to break free. She turns back to Stefan, who is laying back on the couch)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Why are you so calm? Help me. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Because I already tried. You're wasting your energy. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>(whines)</i> Ugh! Every move I make feels like <i>sandpaper</i> rubbing against my veins.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: They're drying us out. First they drain our blood, then they starve us. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>(annoyed)</i> I know how desiccation works, Stefan! 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She picks up a mini-bottle of vodka from the table and opens it) </i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Ah-ah. I wouldn't do that if I were you. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: I can literally <i>feel</i> my cells shrinking. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: You do realize that vodka to a desiccating vampire is like salt water to a human?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>(snaps)</i> What's with the lecture? Just shut up and let me enjoy this. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She drinks the entire mini-bottle in one gulp and sighs in relief. After a moment, Elena appears on the other side of the door) </i>
</p><p>Elena: Knock, Knock. 
</p><p><i>(Stefan and Caroline turn their attention to her at the sound of her voice. Caroline does not look pleased, and Stefan does a good job of playing the part of an angry, humanity-less vampire)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Elena. Let me guess-- Humanity Police was your idea. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Elena opens the window on the door to the room and speaks to them through the bars)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Elena: We really want you back, Caroline. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Caroline lays on her side on the bed with her head propped up with one hand)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Remember that time Jeremy died and you turned off your humanity and tried to kill the prom queen, AKA your best friend Bonnie? I forget. Stefan, was that before or after she killed some waitress for no reason?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>(smirks)</i> I think it was <i>after</i>. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>(Laughs)</i> Heh. You see. Stefan and I are just finding it a little ironic that you think you're qualified to tell us how to deal with the death of a loved one. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: I'm not here to preach to you, Caroline. I just came to show you this. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She holds the envelope up and slips it through the bars. Caroline looks up at her, and Stefan gets up off the couch to take the letter and examine it curiously)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Elena: This letter from your mom arrived at our dorm just a few days after her funeral. Apparently there was something she wanted to tell you. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Caroline sits up on the bed as Stefan walks over to her to hand her the letter) </i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan:<i> (Walks over to Caroline)</i> Does this look real to you?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Caroline stands up and examines it)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Her impeccably perfect handwriting? Yep. I remember when she taught me how to write my name in cursive. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(In that moment it almost seems like she's feeling some emotion as she stares at her mother's handwriting on the envelope, but when she looks back up at Stefan, her eyes say it all)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: So, what, am I supposed to read this and snap back to sad, pathetic, motherless Caroline? Burn it!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>(unable to maintain his poker face)</i> What?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Did I say, "Stand there and look stupid?" No. I said, "Burn it!" 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Elena is horrified)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Well, maybe I should read it first. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Why do you care?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I mean, what happens if eventually you get your humanity back and you hate me for destroying the last think your mom wanted to say to you? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Did those words seriously just come out of your mouth? God! 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She grabs a match book off the top of the old fireplace and lights the match, holding it up to Stefan)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Burn it! Now!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Elena, looking panicked, tries to whisper to Stefan)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Elena: Stefan, don't! No! 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Stefan, having no choice in the matter if he wants Caroline to continue to believe he has no humanity, reluctantly lights the envelope with the lit match. Elena desperately grips the bars on the door)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Elena: <i>(shouts)</i> No! 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>(stays in character)</i> Sorry, Elena, 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(He walks over to the table and drops the flaming letter in the ashtray)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: But, if you want us back, you're gonna have to try a lot harder than that.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(The letter burns, and Elena looks devastated, but Caroline looks gleeful at having beaten them at their game)</i>

<dl><dd> Lily: My God. Lorenzo <i>(She touches his face affectionately but he pulls away quickly, both angry and uncomfortable at the touch)</i> It's you. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: <i>(confused)</i> So you two know each other?

<dl><dd> Lily: The phrase, "small world" comes to mind.

<dl><dd> Elena: Really? What part of extreme floral patterns screams Elena Gilbert to you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Well, excuse me, missy. I guess we've never played the "Let's-Pretend-We're-Human" fantasy game together. All right. Let's play. You're human. Five years from now, where are you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Easy. With you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Boring. I'll need a zip code. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: <i>(confused) Okay. Uh, in a loft in Tribeca above the bar that you work at.</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: <i>(gives her a look) You made me </i>Matt Donovan<i> in your fantasy?</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Okay. You... You own the bar, and when you're not working there, you're... You're on the couch, pouring me wine and massaging my feet after a long day at the O.R. I'm in the surgical residency program. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Of course you are. Kids?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Yeah, of course, eventually, but we should, um, probably have two, you know, so they can keep each other company when we're, you know, distracted by other things. <i>(They kiss)</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Hmm...You got it all figured out, don't you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: How about you? Your turn. Five years from now, where are you?

</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Sounds like the rats are restless. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(In the room currently serving as a prison cell, Caroline and Stefan are both weak and on the floor. Caroline is restless and she groans loudly)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Ugh. Like, actual torture. Elena and Damon talking about their future together. Ech! Just... I want to die. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: They'll make a mistake eventually. And, when they do, we will pounce and drain the first person we can get our teeth on. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Oh, my God. What I would do for just a sip of human blood. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She puts her hand on his leg and sighs)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: You know when you're feeding on someone's neck-- <i>(She runs her hand up his leg and leans toward him)</i>-- and their artery's still pulsing? I really love that. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She leans in to kiss him, but Stefan doesn't seem to be into it)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I thought your veins felt like sandpaper. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: They do. So take my mind off it. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(They kiss. Suddenly Caroline pulls away and gives Stefan a look, but before she can say anything, Damon appears to taunt them by opening the window on the door)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Bored yet? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Go away, Damon.
</dd></dl>
<p>Damon: Brought you some real light reading from the "True Crime" section. 
</p><p><i>(He tosses some pictures clipped to crime files into the room. The files are all of people who Caroline has killed since turning off her humanity)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Curious... Which one of you <i>idiots</i> attacked a stadium security guard and stuffed him in a laundry cart?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: That would have been me. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Stefan and Caroline get to their feet)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: <i>(shrugs)</i> Nice technique. Although, it's probably good that your mom's gone because that would have been a hell of a cover up. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Stefan walks to the door and picks up the files)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Why are you only picking on me? Stefan's in here, too. Annoy him. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Because Stefan didn't snap a bar-back's clavicle in half. You know, it's really quite sad actually. I can see Liz right now-- <i>(Caroline rolls her eyes)</i>-- Calling the parents, breaking the news, wondering where she went wrong as a mother... 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(He throws the rest of the files into the room)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: She got cancer, Damon. That is where she went wrong. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Oh! Blame her. Healthy attitude, Caroline. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: You know what? You're right. I should really just be more like you and Elena, just play make-believe about the future that I can't have, because <i>that's</i> healthy. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She starts talking in a mocking voice, just as Elena approaches the door to join Damon)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Maybe I'll pretend I can actually give birth to babies and have a normal family, and I can get a job without having to move and start over every five years. I can operate on my patients without wanting to feed on them. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Damon is clearly not pleased by the fact that Caroline is making Elena feel so badly)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: You're a real bitch when you're hungry. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: I'm curious, Damon. How does it feel to know that you can't give someone the life that she really wants?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: <i>(angrilyy)</i> Shut up, Caroline! 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>(satisfied)</i> I'm just stating the facts, Elena. You didn't want this life. You can play fantasy-land all you want, but in this life, the one where you're a vampire, you'll always be settling, and it's just <i>so</i> sad. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: I can't listen to this.

<dl><dd> Lily: It's not their fault, but they remind me of a very dark time in my life. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Not one for the maternal instincts, I see. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Lily: On the contrary. They were directed elsewhere. You see, I  was trapped in that prison world with six others. Caring for them as we starved, surviving on two drops of blood a week just to preserve our rations. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Sounds like a chore.

<dl><dd> Caroline: Mom, it's me. It's Caroline. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: I'm afraid you're mistaken. My daughter's kind, compassionate. She looks after those in need. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>(shakes her head desperately)</i> You're not real. You can't be real. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: I raised my daughter to be a good person. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Stop! <i>(Caroline turns around)</i> I know what you're doing. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: And she knows how hurt I would be to see her this way. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Shut up! Stop! You can't be here. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: You are not my daughter!

<p><i>(Caroline gasps awake in bed to find that Stefan is sitting above her)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: It's working. The pain you're feeling, let it in. 
</dd></dl>
<p>Caroline: <i>(furiously)</i> Starve me, bleed me out, put visions in my head? <i>(She gets up)</i> That was your plan all along? 
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>(sternly)</i> You need to come back now, Caroline. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Just get away from me. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I want to show you something. Just take my hand. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(He reaches his hand out so Caroline can grab it)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Ugh! <i>(She pulls a piece of the shutter off the window and points it at Stefan)</i> I said get away from me. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I can help you if you let me. Just please, take my hand. Please, Caroline. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She sighs, lowering the stake and reaching out as though she's going to take his hand. He nods reassuringly, and she smiles before she quickly jams the broken shutter in his stomach. He groans and sputters in pain)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: I don't want your help, Stefan. I just want you to die. Your heart's racing again, Stefan. Let me fix that. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She stabs him again, and Stefan yelps)</i>   
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Agh! Caroline, please stop. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(He grabs hold of Caroline's hand, which is wrapped around the makeshift stake, and uses his vampire telepathy to show her a memory. When she starts to see the memory, she stops what she's doing)</i>  
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stefan.27s_Memory.2FPresent_Day"> Stefan's Memory/Present Day </span></h2>
<p><i>(Stefan is inside the Forbes' living room at some point between the events of <a href="/wiki/The_Day_I_Tried_To_Live/Transcript" title="The Day I Tried To Live/Transcript">The Day I Tried To Live</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stay/Transcript" title="Stay/Transcript">Stay</a>. He looks down at an envelope sitting on the table-- the same envelope that Caroline had him burn earlier in the episode. Liz Forbes comes down the stairs with a sewing kit in hand)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Liz: Okay. Needle and thread, as requested. Do I want to know why you suddenly decided to take up sewing? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>(laughs)</i> Well, Caroline and I spent the entire day digging in the woods to find a <a href="/wiki/Ms._Cuddles" title="Ms. Cuddles">teddy bear</a>, and now she wants to repair it. She's very task-oriented. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: <i>(chuckles)</i> Yes, I'm aware. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She hands him the box, and the memory fades out. In the present, Caroline looks confused and horrified)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>(gasps in shock)</i> What the hell is this?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>(gasps in pain)</i> It...It's a memory, a real one. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(The memory drifts back in, and in the memory, Stefan takes the sewing kit from Liz.</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Thank you. You, uh, should have seen the look on Caroline's face when that bear fell apart. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: You're a good friend to her, Stefan. I hope someday you'll be more than that. <i>(She pauses when she sees Stefan's shocked face, and she smiles)</i> I'm dying. I'm allowed to be blunt. It's a time-saver. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Well, I don't think the timing is right for me and Caroline right now, with everything going on. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: <i>(laughs)</i> Oh, blame me, why don't you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: No, I just mean if I'm gonna start something with Caroline, I want it to be perfect... No loss, no pain, no grief. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: You might be waiting a while. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I'm a patient guy. <i>(He turns to the envelope on the table)</i> Hey. Do you want me to mail that out for you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: Oh. No, thanks. I'm still working on it.  <i>(She picks it up)</i> I'll mail it out tomorrow. I have an idea of what I want to say. It's just... I guess I want it to be perfect, too. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: You're a good mom.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: I hope so. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(The memory fades away, and they both return to the present, where Stefan is starting to desiccate from the small part of the stake that is rubbing against his heart. Caroline quickly realizes what is happening and pulls the stake out, allowing the darkened veins to fade away. Stefan gasps in relief, and Caroline steps away from him, looking emotional)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: I want to see the rest. <i>(Stefan gasps as he recovers from his staking, and Caroline impatiently and forcefully grabs his arm to see the rest)</i> Let me see her! 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(The memory fades back in. Stefan is on the porch of the Forbes house, and he smiles as he walks away. Liz smiles back at him and closes the door, just as Caroline rushes up the porch steps to see her mother)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Wait, wait. Mom! Mom! It's me! It's Caroline. <i>(She emotionally knocks on the door)</i> Just come outside. I want to talk to you. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Her mom walks away, unable to see or hear her, and since Stefan had left, there was no more of the memory for Caroline to see)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>(desperately)</i> I want to read your letter! Please. Mommy! <i>(She continues frantically Knocking on the door)</i> Mom, please. Come back. <i>(She cries and turns around to find Stefan)</i> Make her come back! 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(In the present day, Caroline is pleading with Stefan, who looks at her sadly)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: ...I can't.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>(starts to cry)</i> No. Just show me the vision again, okay? I... I want to see my mom, Stefan. I... I need to know what she said in that letter. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I already gave you the letter. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Caroline realizes what she did and frantically rushes over to the ashtray, only to find that the letter has been completely burned)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: No. No. No! <i>(She starts to sob)</i> What do you think she wanted to tell me? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Whatever it was, it's gone. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: No. I did this. This is all my fault. <i>(She drops onto her knees on the floor)</i> No. I tried to kill you, and then I made you turn it off, and then we... Oh, my God. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(She becomes overwhelmed with emotion, and Stefan looks at her sadly and tries to console her)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: It's okay, Caroline. It's okay.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: I'm so sorry, Stefan. I ruined everything. I ruined everything.

</p>
<dl><dd> Lily: Tell me you have the Ascendant. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: I can't, because I don't.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Lily: Then you understand what's going to happen next. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Oh, it will just be like old times. I screw up, and you punish me for it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Lily drops the box with the cure into the fire, and Damon, surprised, walks toward her with wide eyes)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Lily: Some things never change.  Spare me your indignation. We both know I did you a favor. That sense of relief you feel right now, that's the realization that Elena will never leave you. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Elena enters the kitchen and removes her jacket, only to see the table covered with red rose petals and lit white candles. A jewelry box is mounted in the center of the table. She pauses, drops her keys on the table and gasps)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Lily: You made her choice for her. There's no harm in that. As long as you're happy, she never needs to know. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Elena picks up the box with a shaky hand and opens it, truly surprised to see what is inside. She gasps with surprise and excitement when she sees the cure is in the box. Meanwhile, in the living room, Lily turns back to the fire and uses the poker to open the box, revealing that the cure isn't inside it)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Lily: Although, wait a minute... Making Elena yours forever, that's exactly what you want. That wouldn't be a punishment at all. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Elena rushes into the room with the box in her hand)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Elena: Damon! Damon, is this...  
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(Lily turns toward her and answers for him)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Lily: The cure to vampirism. I left it out for you to find since Damon was never going to offer it to you. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: <i>(hurt and confused)</i> Is that true? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Elena, I can explain.

<dl><dd> Lily: You came. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: In 1903, I was sick. My own family had abandoned me, and you took me under your wing and rescued me from death. As it turns out, loyalty is important to me, too. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Lily: <i>(whispers)</i> They make cars so quiet now. One hardly hears them coming. <i>(Enzo listens to her speak, but is clearly confused as to where her story is going)</i> I was out for a walk to clear my head.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(A memory drifts in-- Lily is walking across the same road she stands on now, when headlights approach her. The car comes to a quick halt before it can hit her, its tires screeching to a stop as the driver honks its horn. Lily turns toward the car and gives a hand gesture to apologize)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Lily: <i>(voiceover)</i> I apologized, of course, but I'd given the driver quite a shock by walking in front of his car. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>(In flashback, she approaches the driver's side window to apologize to the man)</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Lily: His heart was beating like a drum. I could see the pulse in his neck, and in that moment, I forgot all my troubles. I felt no pain, no despair, no loneliness.

<dl><dd> Elena: Why not?

<dl><dd> Elena: Damon, it was just a stupid game.

<dl><dd> Damon: All I see in five years from now is you. You see your entire future, and I want you to have that. I want you to live in a big city and be a surgeon and have a family. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: <i>(confused)</i> Then why would you keep it a secret from me for so many days and then try to have it destroyed?
