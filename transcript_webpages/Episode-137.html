<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="FLASH-FORWARD--_ALARIC.27S_HOUSE.2C_2016">FLASH-FORWARD-- ALARIC'S HOUSE, 2016</span></h2>
<p><i>[Three years from now, in an unknown town, Alaric is sitting at the dining room table of a house, where he is using a soldering iron to attach wires to some kind of machinery. His face is covered in sweat, and initially, it looks as though Alaric is wiring a bomb or some other explosive. However, once he's finished, the camera pans backward, revealing that Alaric is actually trying to fix a baby doll. He pushes the button to test it, but when it doesn't work, he groans in annoyance]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Oh, damn it!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, two very young girls appear next to the table. They look to be fraternal twins, one of whom has brown hair and one has dark blonde hair, and are probably only three or four years old. They are presumably Alaric's children]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BOTH GIRLS: Is it fixed yet?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[smiles]</i> Not yet. Sweetheart, it's past your bedtime!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BOTH GIRLS: <i>[disappointedly]</i> No!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Yes, it is! Do you want to brush your teeth?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The girls giggle loudly and run away]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BOTH GIRLS: No!!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric chuckles and calls after them as they continue to run into the other room as they giggle hysterically]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Yeah? Well, too bad!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric then mutters under his breath as he turns off the lamp on the table]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Surgery will have to resume tomorrow.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric raises his voice to call out to the girls]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: All right. Josie, help your sister find her PJs, okay?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The girls continue to giggle and run around. However, after a long moment, they become silent, and when Alaric notices the lack of noise, he begins to get concerned]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[confused]</i> Girls?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When he gets no response, he begins to seriously worry and stands to his feet. He then walks over to a nearby cupboard, where he opens one of the doors and pulls out one of his stake-shooting guns, which has four additional stakes attached to the side. He then slowly walks out into the foyer and cocks his gun before seeing something ahead of him and gaping in shock. The camera turns and reveals that Damon is standing in the threshold of the open front door while Alaric's daughters stand between then and stare at him in confusion]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Damon.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[smirks]</i> Well, aren't you adorable?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon glances down at the twins]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Heh. You girls, too.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric frowns and quickly rushes to put himself in between the twins and Damon]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Stand behind daddy.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Why so gloomy? Looks like you got everything you wanted.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[nervously]</i> The fact that you're here means somebody died.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No, not yet. But, if you don't do exactly as I say, that could change real fast.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric gulps anxiously and stares at Damon as he leans against the door frame]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: So, you gonna invite me in?

<p><i>[In the present, Alaric is in the morgue, where he is crouched down in front of the drawer that holds Jo's body while he turns the Phoenix Stone between his fingers. Just then, the ME's assistant walks into the room and groans in annoyance when he sees him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ASSISTANT: Jeez, you're here... At five AM.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[quietly]</i> I'm gonna need the place to myself tonight.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ASSISTANT: <i>[scoffs]</i> Oh, come on, man! Don't make me an accomplice to whatever weird stuff you're doing with your wife's dead body.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: You have <i>no</i> idea how weird it's gonna get.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric reaches into his pocket and pulls out two $100 bills before holding them up]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Is this enough to buy some privacy?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The assistant sighs and takes the money]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ASSISTANT: I'm gonna throw in a free reality check-- preserved bodies <i>still</i> have an expiration date, and this is her last day.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The assistant sighs and turns toward the door, calling out one last statement before he leaves]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ASSISTANT: She doesn't have to stay home, but she can't stay here.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
<i>[Meanwhile, Damon is walking through the wing of the hospital that is currently under construction as he talks to Lily on the phone. Lily is on the road to Whitmore with Elena's coffin in the backseat of her car]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Mother, tell me you have Elena.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: Let me speak to Oscar.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No can do. I'm about to wake him up from his little vervain nap.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[annoyed]</i> You <i>do</i> realize that when you get her back, you're not actually getting her back, right? She's still in a box.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> Do you think I need to be reminded of that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: And yet, you're leveraging a member of my family just to get her body closer to you. How selfish can you be?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Spare the lecture, Mommy.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[seriously]</i> Damon, if you have harmed Oscar in any way...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Say goodbye to Elena. It's not my first hostage swap!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon hangs up the phone and walks into the room where he was keeping Oscar hooked up to various IV drips of vervain]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Oscar...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Once Damon gets into the room, he stops dead in his tracks when he realizes that Oscar is no longer where he left him. Instead, all that remains is a puddle of blood in the middle of the table]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[alarmed]</i> Uh-oh. Oscar?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon slowly walks around the room and looks around]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I can smell the blood on you, buddy.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The door of the nearby closet pops open a crack, which confuses Damon]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Huh?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When he opens the door further, Oscar's body tumbles out of it, and Damon just barely catches him before he falls. When he looks at his face and sees that his skin is gray and desiccated, his eyes widen in alarm and horror]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You've gotta be <i>kidding</i> me!
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WHITMORE_COLLEGE"> WHITMORE COLLEGE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Bonnie is packing up a couple grimoires and books on magic into her large purse while Caroline appears to be sleeping soundly in her bed. However, when Bonnie attempts to quietly leave without disturbing her, Caroline dramatically clears her throat]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Ahem.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I didn't want to wake you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Well, I would lose more sleep if you just snuck out without saying hi!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline scoots over in bed and gestures toward the bed so Bonnie can sit with her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Hi!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie hugs her and covers them both up with the comforter]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Mmm... I missed this.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[jokingly]</i> Am I gonna catch fire?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: No! I just can't touch vampires. Valerie basically turned my skin into vervain.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I'll work on unraveling the spell when I--
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Stop! We have so much to catch up on. Let's just go shopping for Halloween costumes and we can worry about magic later.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Kind of worrying about magic already. Alaric think we can reunite Jo's spirit with her body by using some sketchy Native American resurrection stone. My job is to crush his dreams in the most <i>gentle</i> way possible.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Wow! Okay... You don't even think it'll work?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I don't think it <i>should</i>. The Other Side is gone, there's no more Gemini prison world, which means Jo's spirit... is probably at peace.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[sighs]</i> Our lives are weird.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Tell me about it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie and Caroline snuggle up to each other and smile]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ALARIC.27S_APARTMENT"> ALARIC'S APARTMENT </span></h2>
<p><i>[Damon has just brought Oscar's body back to Alaric's apartment, where an unhappy Stefan is berating him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: How the <i>hell</i> did you let this happen?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[offended]</i> Don't even <i>think</i> about blaming this on me! I'm not the one that unscrewed his heart.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: No, you're just the one who chased him down, kidnapped him... and are still <i>technically</i> holding him hostage.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: To get Elena back!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[gives him a look]</i> And how's that working out for you? Because from where I'm standing, she's in more danger than ever because you won't let her rest!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> You spend one day with Mommy Dearest, and now you're on her side?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I don't have to be on her side to see what's happening here. You can't be with Elena, so you're making all your bad decisions about <i>Elena</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon sighs and points at Oscar]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: We need to get rid of this body.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[shakes his head]</i> No, no, no. <i>You</i> need to get rid of this body!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon looks at Stefan exasperatedly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Ugh!

<p><i>[Enzo comes down to the kitchen to find Valerie cooking]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Breakkie! What are we having?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Mushroom omelettes.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo reaches into a nearby dish and grabs a mushroom, only for Valerie to swat at his hand, though she looks just uncomfortable enough to make it clear she's hiding something]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Hey! They're for Oscar, not you. He's coming home today.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo looks at her suspiciously]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: I'm impressed. Especially considering how late you got home last night.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie looks at him, concerned that he knows the truth, but before she can reply to him, Lily walks into the kitchen, looking very unhappy. Valerie frowns nervously when she sees Lily has come home alone]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Where's Oscar?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: I don't know. Damon never showed up. I suppose I've taken the notion of trust for granted lately.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily sighs before glancing over at Enzo]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Lorenzo, would you mind terribly if I had a moment alone with Valerie?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo shoots a curious look at Valerie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Is something wrong?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[smiles weakly]</i> Just some family business.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo leaves without another word, and once he's gone, Lily confronts Valerie, though not about what she's expecting]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: I spent yesterday with Stefan. Learned all about your little <i>tryst</i> in 1863.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie looks shocked, but does her best to cover it up]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[nervously]</i> We were children. It was... It was puppy love! It meant <i>nothing</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[in disbelief]</i> Hmm. Right. That explains why you held onto his journal all these years.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[hesitates]</i> You were fragile at the time. I didn't want to upset you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: You told him you were coming back for him, and he believed you. Why put him through that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[even more nervously]</i> I was a foolish human back then. I'm sorry.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily gives Valerie a cold look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: I will only say this once. If you have <i>anything</i> to tell me-- anything at all-- now is the time.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[pauses]</i> I have nothing to hide.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily examines her closely for a moment, and Valerie, uncomfortable, changes the subject]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I should go look for Oscar.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: That won't be necessary.

<p><i>[Nora and Mary Louise are walking through WHITMORE'S CAMPUS on their way to find Oscar. Nora looks relieved to be out and about as she sips on her smoothie and talks to her girlfriend]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>God</i>, it feels good to come out of that deserted town and be around living, breathing humans we can eat! Mystic Falls is the prison world all over again.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise rolls her eyes, but still smiles at her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: We're on a mission, Nora. Not a vacation.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
<i>[Inside ALARIC'S APARTMENT, Damon and Stefan are carrying Oscar toward the door in order to dispose of his body]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: All right...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just as they're about to leave, they hear a knock on the door and immediately freeze where they're standing. It's Nora and Mary Louise]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Damon? I know you're in here. Open up!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When the boys don't respond, Mary Louise scowls and knocks on the door again, more furious this time]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Damon, open the--
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Before she can finish, Damon opens the door with a fake smile on his face]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hello.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise just glares at him before walking in without a word, and Nora gives him a cool smile as she walks in after her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Oh. Hello.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary looks around the living room in distaste as Damon and Stefan join her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: University housing. How lovely.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[snidely]</i> How <i>sad</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[laughs]</i> Not as sad as being exiled here by your own mother. Lily must have had the wrong address for the hostage exchange. Where's Oscar?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[nervously]</i> You just missed him.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[skeptically]</i> You reek of blood.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sheepishly]</i> Well, I've been... I've been binge-ing.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: And I've been <i>judging</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yeah.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora gives them both a look as she picks up a very old looking ceramic vase from the nearby shelf]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Not gonna find him in there.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora drops the vase onto the floor, causing it to shatter, and Damon winces when he realizes how mad Alaric is going to be]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[groans]</i> Ughhh. Look, I get it. Okay? You got me--
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora walks across the room and purposely knocks over a jade glass statue, which shatters on the coffee table. The sight of it makes Damon get desperate to stop them, and Stefan hastily grabs a framed photo of Alaric and Jo out of Nora's hands before she can break it as well]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Oscar turned the tables, and he knocked me out, and he took off. I lost my <i>one</i> and only bargaining chip.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[in disbelief]</i> Then why isn't Oscar answering his phone?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan watches as Nora sees the door to the bathroom is ajar and walks over to look inside]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[anxiously]</i> I mean, the guy doesn't want to be found!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When Nora pushes the bathroom door open, she's surprised to see that no one is inside]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[annoyed]</i> Why don't I believe you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[sighs dramatically]</i> Well, this is pointless. Come, Nora.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise gives Nora a significant look, and she reluctantly follows her girlfriend to leave. As she walks out the door, she drops her nearly-finished smoothie onto the ground and gives Damon a smug look as the remaining contents splatters all over the floor]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[winces]</i> I'll throw that away for you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Once Nora and Mary Louise walk out the door, Damon sighs and gives Stefan an annoyed look. The girls walk out of the apartment complex and head back onto campus, not noticing that Oscar's body has been hung out the window by a sheet that has been wrapped around his chest. Once Damon and Stefan are sure Mary Louise and Nora won't see them, they start to work on retrieving him. However, a student dressed as a zombie glances up at them and looks confused, though he seems to believe Oscar is simply a Halloween decoration. Damon and Stefan both smile fakely and wave at him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hey!
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
<i>[Once the kid leaves, the brothers work on bringing Oscar back inside. The scene cuts back into Alaric's apartment, where Stefan and Damon are carrying Oscar's body towards the door]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Screw it. Let's just get this guy to the furnace.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[They toss Oscar's body onto the couch. Just then, a pretty college girl walks into the apartment and stares at them blankly. Stefan and Damon visibly begin to panic at the sight of her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[awkwardly]</i> Uh, wrong... door... darling.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The girl rolls her eyes and holds out a cream-colored envelope, which Stefan hesitantly takes from her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hmmm. 'Kay.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan opens the envelope and reads it aloud, looking confused as he does so]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: "A message from Miss Nora Hildegard, dictated but not read. For every hour that Oscar isn't returned, a Whitmore student will die... Starting now."
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Before they can react, the girl stabs herself in the neck with a letter opener and gags as she collapses onto the floor. Stefan looks alarmed, but Damon just looks horrified]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan turns to look at Damon with wide eyes as the girl bleeds out on the floor in front of them]</i>

<dl><dd> ENZO: Really? You hear about the noises in the old boarding house? The mysterious figure haunting the clock tower? Tell your ghostbusters to charge up their proton packs-- they've hit the proverbial jackpot!

<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[amused]</i> Don't waste the ammunition, mate. Waste of taxpayer money! And I am one of your <i>last</i> taxpayers.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> What do you want, Enzo?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[sighs]</i> Oh, God. Just a good night's rest... Which is proving difficult lately, with all the late-night sneaking in and out of the Salvatore house. Vamp-hearing's bad enough, but once the Heretics start creeping, that's when I <i>really</i> lose sleep.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[smiles]</i> There's an abandoned music shop down the way. I'll let you steal a tiny fiddle!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[chuckles]</i> Or, you could grant me access to the town surveillance system. I have a Heretic to track.

<dl><dd> CAROLINE: I take it your charm didn't work on getting Valerie to undo the spell?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[sheepishly]</i> Uh, I haven't spoken to her yet...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[disappointedly]</i> Oh. So you're avoiding?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: No. There's nothing to avoid.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[sighs]</i> Well, Stefan, she was your first love, and then she just left you hanging. You're not the least bit curious why?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[shrugs]</i> She hasn't contacted me in the four months she's been back, so I'm assuming she's as over it as I am.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Yeah, but that is quite an assumption, considering that she's the reason why I literally can't touch you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[sighs]</i> Unfortunately, she's the Heretic that I am the <i>least</i> concerned about right now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[rolls her eyes]</i> Oh, God! Who now?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Let's just say that it involves two bored mean-girls on a campus full of easy targets. But, I have come up with a genius plan to keep them occupied while Damon sorts out his Oscar problem.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> STEFAN: Mmhmm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[skeptically]</i> Full of potential victims...?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: And distractions! All in one place. Easy to babysit. I think the hardest part will be feigning enthusiasm.

<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[offended]</i> What's <i>that</i> supposed to mean?

<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Nothing! No, you two will fit in <i>just</i> fine. Seriously, you guys have <i>nothing</i> to feel self-conscious about.

</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise, looking slightly nervous, turns toward Caroline, who hands her the purse]</i>

<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: I haven't been to a party since New Year's 1902. Be honest-- will I make a proper modern devil?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[fake smiles]</i> Shouldn't be too much of a stretch...

</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline sighs and turns to face her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Look, I gave you an outfit. Now, it's your turn. Siphon off this <i>annoying</i> anti-vampire spell.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[feigns sympathy]</i> Aw, are you prohibited from showing physical affection for your significant other? Try being <i>gay</i> in 1900.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: What do you care about some silly spell? You don't even like Valerie.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[In an unexpected twist, Mary Louise actually looks nervous as she responds to Caroline]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: You're right. I don't. I've had to endure <i>two lifetimes</i> with that conniving shrew, and I've learned that when it comes to Val? You don't get on her bad side.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: That's not the Valerie that I knew.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[shrugs]</i> Well, I used to be a sickly, abused little urchin cast out by my coven, and then I met Mary Louise. Love changes people. I mean, maybe Valerie's obsession with you is the reason why she's a walking funeral dirge.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[self-consciously]</i> I'm comfortable like this, Nora. Don't!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora ignores her and rips the neckline of Mary Louise's dress so that it has a slit that bares her cleavage. However, this just makes Mary Louise even more insecure, and she becomes upset]</i>
</p>

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[scoffs]</i> Well, that's nonsense. No one who ever met Julian would dare say a bad thing about him. He was a saint.

<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: How old do you think I am?? I could think of nothing more futile than prattling on about one's emotions. As if I can prevent Nora from drifting away if I only find the right words...

<dl><dd> STEFAN: Or as if confronting my first love will somehow make her disappear.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise looks at Stefan in confusion, so he elaborates]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Caroline thinks that Valerie's mere <i>existence</i> is somehow sabotaging our relationship. But, if she could just get into my head, she would see that the only thing standing between me and my girlfriend is that damn spell... Which you can remove.

Nora's face and neck begin to sizzle loudly from the contact with Caroline's vervain-laced skin, and she desperately wriggles in an attempt to get loose, though the vervain is weakening her too much to fight back with her full strength.

However, just as everyone else begins to clap as well, they are quickly proven to be mistaken when Oscar, covered in blood (presumably from feeding on the tour guide) breaks the emergency door in the back and loudly growls at them, fully vamped-out and baring his fangs, scaring everyone to the point of screaming in fear]</i>

<p><i>[Damon has just set the victims of Oscar's Halloween tour bus massacre on fire to hide the evidence before returning to talk to Lily</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: I've asked Beau to remove the cloaking spell from Elena's coffin. You will find her in the ruins of the old Salvatore mansion.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> Clever... ish.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[smugly]</i> I do think so.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon pauses before he speaks up]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'm moving back to Mystic Falls.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily looks momentarily surprised by this request, but she does her best to appear casual about it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[surprised]</i> I will certainly ask the family to take it under consideration.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[annoyed]</i> It wasn't a request. These people didn't deserve to be killed by one of your free-range children; Stefan's up to his hero-hair in Heretic drama; and I worry that Matt Donovan's funeral is gonna cut into my social schedule.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[skeptically]</i> And <i>what</i>? You're gonna help keep order? Damon, you could hardly keep a covered box safe. You <i>do</i> realize that this innate desire to keep Elena physically present in your life, this boyish refusal to let her go, will only put her in more danger? After everything you've been through, what a shame it would be to lose her because you're too terrified to find out who you actually are without her.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon scowls at his mother, not at all thrilled about what she's just said. After a moment, Lily turns to leave, but gives Damon one last parting statement before she goes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: If you dare to return to Mystic Falls, it's no skin off my nose.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Before she can leave, Damon calls out to her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I want one more thing.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="CLOSING_MONTAGE"> CLOSING MONTAGE </span></h2>
<p><i>[At the SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE, Damon is seen walking down into the wine cellar in the basement, where he takes an old bottle of wine out of a drawer. Back at the OLD SALVATORE ESTATE, Damon is seen sitting on one of the broken-down walls in the ruins, where he is writing in a journal, narrating the entry in voiceover as he does so]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voice-over] Dear Elena... Yes, you heard that correctly-- Hell has frozen over. I'm writing it all down. Granted, I'm a half-bottle in, thanks to my 1950 Chateau Cheval Blanc, a bottle I waited 65 years to open. I used to spend nights sitting in my wine cellar, convincing myself I could actually hear it age-- tannins growing, fermenting. But, appreciating its beauty didn't make the time go by any faster. The bottle just laid there on its shelf, torturing me while I waited for Katherine and time stood still.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon picks up his wine glass and spins the contents in his hand for a moment before sniffing it and taking a large sip. Beside him is Elena's coffin, which has been pulled out of its hiding place]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] Eventually, I convinced myself that no sip of that wine could ever taste as good as I dreamt it would, so I hid the bottle and walked away. And </i>that<i> is the story of why I drink bourbon.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon leans forward and smiles weakly as he rubs the top of Elena's coffin with his hand]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] I don't know who I am without you. But I </i>do<i> know that as long as I'm without you, time will stand still.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, an SUV pulls up in front of Damon, and Tyler gets out to greet him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] So, who is Damon Salvatore without Elena Gilbert? A selfish friend?</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[At WHITMORE MEDICAL CENTER, Bonnie and Alaric are standing by the autopsy table where Jo's body has been laid out. The book of Alaric's is on the table, and Bonnie is holding one of Jo's hands in her own while she casts the spell, staring at the Phoenix Stone resting on Jo's chest]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] A jealous brother?</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[At WHITMORE COLLEGE, Caroline and Stefan are laying naked in bed, covered only in a sheet. They're spooning, and Caroline is fast asleep, though Stefan is still awake and smiling happily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] A horrible son?</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[At the SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE, Oscar is still unconscious in bed while Lily, looking concerned, walks in to set a glass of ice water on the bedside table. Lily then leans over and brushes a lock of hair off of his forehead with her fingers]</i>
</p><p><i>[At the SALVATORE ESTATE, Damon helps Tyler load Elena's coffin into his SUV before Tyler gets into his car to drive away, leaving a saddened Damon behind]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] Or maybe, with a little luck, I'll do right by you. Because you may be one thousand miles away, or one hundred years away, but you're still with me, and my heart is right there in that coffin with you... </i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[At WHITMORE MEDICAL CENTER, Bonnie is finishing up the spell, and the bubbles within the Phoenix Stone moves as the magic takes hold]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[voiceover] ...Until you come back to me.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, Jo's eyes flick open, causing Alaric and Bonnie to gasp in shock and relief. Jo, confused, slowly looks around at them, her face still pale and colorless]</i>
