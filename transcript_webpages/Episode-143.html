<p><i>[Damon's soul is currently in his own personal hell in the Phoenix Stone, which has just brought him back to a memory of fighting in the Civil War for the Confederate Army. A landmine has just gone off in the woods where they're fighting, causing several soldiers to be forcefully thrown backward. Damon is laying flat on the forest floor with a large bloody wound on his abdomen from being hit with mortar shells. He groans in pain as he pulls himself onto his feet and looks around in horror as he watches Confederate and Union soldiers alike falling in the battle. Suddenly, a familiar female voice is heard behind him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Have a nice nap?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon turns around and is shocked to see Lily, dressed in a blue gown typical of the era and looking at him curiously]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[stunned]</i> Mother?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Before Damon can react further, another landmine explodes, and Damon ducks to avoid the shrapnel. Suddenly, Henry, one of the vampires from the tomb that Katherine turned in 1864, calls out to him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> HENRY: Salvatore, help me!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, still dazed, turns to find Henry pinned under the wheel of a large cannon]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Henry!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon quickly turns back to Lily, only to find that she has completely vanished. It's clear that he's overwhelmed by what he just saw, but Henry's cries eventually snap him out of it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> HENRY: Please! You must help me.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon finally stumbles over to where Henry has been pinned down and starts pushing the cannon off of his friend]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> HENRY: <i>[groans in pain]</i> Aah!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Once the cannon has been moved, Damon bends over to help Henry to his feet]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Come, Henry. We are getting you out of here.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon puts Henry's arm around his shoulder and helps him walk away from the battle as landmines continue to go off around them and soldiers shoot at each other with their muskets]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[The next morning, a bugle call is played loudly, which awakens Damon from his sleep. He groans in pain and looks at his patched up wounds before realizing he's laying on a cot at the field hospital. On the cot next to him sits Henry, who is dirty and has a bloody wound on his head but otherwise looks fine]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> HENRY: <i>[smiles]</i> Hi there, hero. You've been out a long time.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, an older soldier walks into the tent with a large bag of mail]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MAIL SOLDIER: Mail call!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The soldier hands Damon an envelope, and he stares at it for a long moment]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> HENRY: News from home?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: My brother.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon frowns in concern as he opens the letter, and Stefan's voice narrates the message in voiceover]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[voiceover] "Dear Damon. They tell us to only send good news, but I cannot. The days grow darker in Mystic Falls, and my heart darker still. Valerie left and never came back. Father drinks himself to sleep nightly. As the anniversary of mother's death approaches, I find myself unable to sleep, paralyzed by a waking dread that I cannot shake and dare not name. I wish you were here, brother, to teach me how to survive these endless nights."</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, looking even more concerned now, folds the letter in his hands and considers Stefan's words for a moment]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[The scene cuts to the Colonel's tent, where Damon has just walked in to speak with him. He's wearing a clean uniform, and looks nervous to be there]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Colonel, sir?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The Colonel looks up from his desk and stares at Damon]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> COLONEL: Lieutenant Salvatore.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon takes a deep breath to steady himself]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I would like to request two weeks leave to go home, sir.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The Colonel laughs in amusement]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> COLONEL: You and every man out here, Salvatore. No. Request denied.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I fear my brother is in a very bad way, sir. I would not ask if I did not believe he <i>truly</i> needs me. I do not wish to shirk my duties. If there is something you need done, I shall do it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> COLONEL: Anything?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[hopefully]</i> Anything. Yes, sir.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> COLONEL: All right, then. I've got a mission. Honestly, it's more of a chore.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: For a chance to see my brother, I will gladly accept it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> COLONEL: There's a farmhouse twelve miles to the east. Rumor is there are Union sympathizers there hiding Confederate deserters. Now, if these rumors are true, I need those deserters arrested and brought back to me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Consider it done. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, looking relieved, leaves the tent]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[The scene cuts to the woods, where Damon and Henry are walking away from the camp. Damon has a compass in his hand, and he uses it to point him east toward the farmhouse. Henry is talking to Damon excitedly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> HENRY: Two weeks at home? Can you imagine? How grand. I cannot wait to see my girl Olive. She's a real peach. You have a sweetheart, Damon?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sighs]</i> No, but I have to see my brother.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Henry, remembering the task at hand, begins to look uneasy]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> HENRY: Damon, are you certain about this?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: About what, Henry?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> HENRY: About the mission. These men, these deserters we are supposed to capture, they are just regular fellows who do not believe in the cause. Like me. Like <i>you</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: It is true. I could give a damn about this war, Henry. To be honest, I only enlisted to please my father.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> HENRY: Well, then how can you be fine with rounding up men just like you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: It is not my fault they deserted, Henry. They made their beds. But now, they're our ticket home. Come.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Henry and Damon finally make it to the farmhouse, where they knock on the front door. It is answered by a stern-looking woman in a plain white dress, and Damon smiles weakly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hello, ma'am. Could you spare some dinner for two hungry soldiers?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> WOMAN: No. Sorry.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The woman is about to shut the door when Damon stops her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I do not need to remind you that quartering is your wartime duty, not to mention the law.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The woman sighs and reluctantly opens the door wider so they can enter]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Thank you, ma'am.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The three walk into the kitchen, where an older woman, a middle-aged woman, and a young girl are chopping up food. Damon greets them awkwardly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hello. We are your surprise dinner guests.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Henry, looking uncomfortable, leans forward to whisper in Damon's ear]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> HENRY: Should I check the upstairs?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[whispers]</i> Yes, please.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Henry leaves to do as he's told, and Damon smiles nervously at his hosts]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Henry here's going to freshen up. Clean hands, clean mind.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He turns and looks at the nearby fireplace, glancing around for contraband]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'm sure you're not one of those families hiding munitions from the war effort, but orders being what they are, it is my duty to check.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon opens up a nearby cupboard and finds jars of preserved oranges]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'm glad to see someone takes the warning about the devil and idle hands seriously.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> WOMAN: We have a lot of fruit.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I see that, ma'am.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The woman looks back at the young girl, and when Damon goes to check the record player, the girl opens a hidden door in the pantry, and the two deserters rush out with their guns aimed at Damon. Damon quickly pulls out his own pistol and aims it at them, though he looks nervous by the prospect of having to use it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DESERTER #1: No, no, no, no! Kindly lay your gun down.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon holds up his left hand while he uses his right to slowly put his gun onto the floor in front of him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I do not want any trouble.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DESERTER #1: If you turn around and go right now, you will find none. All we want is is to go home.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon anxiously turns so his back is to the deserters while Henry lurks in the entrance hall with his gun as he prepares to enter. When he realizes Henry is out there, he turns back around to face the men]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: See, that is the problem. I want to go home too.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon quickly ducks as Henry shoots the younger deserter in the chest, causing the women to yelp in fright. When the middle-aged woman runs to help, Damon, who has picked up his gun, shoots her as well]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> WOMAN: Unh!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[As the woman falls to the floor, her daughter cries out in shock]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> YOUNG GIRL: Ma!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She runs over to their guns, but Damon, who looks horrified, shoots her as well, along with the grandmother when she runs toward him with her kitchen knife]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> GRANDMA: Agh! Unh!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The first deserter shoots at Damon, but he ducks before it can hit him and shoots him in the chest]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DESERTER #1: Unh!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The first deserter falls to the ground, and Damon and Henry, both shell-shocked by what just happened, look at each other in horror]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> HENRY: Oh, God!, Oh, God. Damon... What have we done?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, who is covered in blood, is startled by the sound of a creaking floorboard from behind the pantry]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Wait here.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He walks toward the pantry with his gun raised as he passes through the hidden door into the storage room]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Please, enough blood has been shed. Lay down your weapon. Please.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When he finally turns the corner, he sees that the person waiting in the room is Lily, dressed in the same clothes from the beginning of the flashback]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[stunned]</i> Mother?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: Hello, Damon.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon stares at her in disbelief]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You cannot be here. You died of consumption. We buried you in Mystic Falls.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: Oh, my sweet, sweet son. I'm dead, all right. You saw to that.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon becomes even more flustered by confusion]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You died. I was there. This doesn't make any sense.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He pauses as his eyes widen, as though he's remembering something]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: But it's starting to come back to you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: This isn't real.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: Your spirit is trapped inside the Phoenix Stone. This really happened, didn't it?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: In 1863. I got a letter from Stefan. He seemed hopeless. I just wanted to go home to him. Even though I had my doubts, I started to round up deserters. It all went so wrong so fast.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: Did you ever take responsibility for the incident?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: What do you mean?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: You and Henry covered it up and never spoke of it again.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: How do you know that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: Maybe it's time to give yourself up.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She reaches out to caress his face, but Damon swats her hand away and becomes defensive]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Why? For what? They were deserters. They ambushed us. I didn't come here looking to kill anybody.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: You had your reservations, but you still marched forward.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon starts to remember what is really going on, and he becomes frustrated and annoyed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[angrily]</i> So hell is being raked over the coals for something I haven't thought about in 150 years? Sorry. You're gonna have to do a lot better than that.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: The longer you keep your trauma at arm's length, the harder this is going to be for you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[smirks sarcastically]</i> Hmm. I see. And this PTSD puppet show wouldn't happen to be, by chance, a ploy to get me to be remorseful for your pointless death? Because it ain't working, Mama.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: This isn't about remorse, Damon.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon hears the click of a revolver and looks down to find that Lily has taken it out of his hands and aimed it at his stomach while he wasn't paying attention]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: It's about <i>punishment</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily pulls the trigger and shoots him]</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Damon? Hey. Please tell me you know who you are.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon looks around wildly and picks up the Phoenix Stone so he can look at it, but doesn't get up, which worries Bonnie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Damon, say something.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[weakly]</i> I know who I am, Bon-Bon.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Good. Means I actually got the spell right for once.

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Ohh.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: How do you feel?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Like I just spent a day in the life of young Damon Salvatore.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie looks at him with concern]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: A day? Damon, you've been dead for three months.

<p><i>[After the break, the scene returns to Damon and Bonnie at the Salvatore Boarding House, where he's sitting on the pool table while Bonnie pours him a glass of bourbon. She then walks over to him and looks at him with concern]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: You sure you're okay? No desire to lash out or break anything?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Nope.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon frowns when he notices that blood is starting to pour from her nose]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: But, you don't look so good...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon points to his own nose and looks at her with concern. When Bonnie realizes she got a witchy nosebleed, she rushes to grab a tissue and dab it away as Damon downs his entire drink in one gulp]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I'm fine. Just, weak. It took three Heretics to successfully find Julian's spirit in that stone, and I did it solo.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon realizes that they're all alone in the house and becomes concerned]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Wow. It's not that I was expecting a parade, but where's my parade?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Caroline's at Whitmore, Alaric's at a lecture, and Matt's on patrol. I'm sorry. It's been three months. I... it's not like...

</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: You're gonna need another.

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Where is he, Bonnie?

</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: When Julian stabbed you, Nora stabbed Stefan, and I... I haven't been able to bring him back yet.

<dl><dd> DAMON: You're telling me my brother's still stuck in here and you brought me out first?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[makes a face]</i> That didn't sound even like a <i>glimmer</i> of a thank you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Where is he, Bonnie?

<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[sighs]</i> He's in his bedroom.

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: We <i>have</i> to get him out.

<dl><dd> BONNIE: He was just in here.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, he's not now, Bonnie, which begs the question-- how do you not see an unconscious vampire walk out the front door?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie sighs and frowns when she sees a note pinned to the candle on the nearby table with a dart from the dartboard]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Because he didn't walk out the front door.

<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[shrugs]</i> Was that a yes or a no?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[incredulously]</i> What is it like inside your head? I'm genuinely curious because it must be wonderfully liberating to <i>only</i> see what you want to see.

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You know what I'm curious about?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[mockingly]</i> Hmm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Why the Phoenix Stone made my mother a character in my hellscape when it had so many other options of torture to choose from.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[rolls her eyes]</i> And <i>this</i> is why I begged Bonnie to get Stefan out first.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, why didn't she?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Because logic prevailed.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: What the hell's that supposed to mean?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Nothing.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, frustrated, walks over to Caroline and stares at her intensely]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Blondie, you do not get to make this moment the only time you ever decided to shut up. Tell me. What am I missing?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Look.... Uh, I don't know what you've just been through, or what it's like in that thing. But the longer that you are trapped, the more your humanity gets stripped away.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> Well, here I am all full of emotions. The question is, why isn't my brother?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[exasperatedly]</i> Because we figured if you were gone too long you would come back devoid of humanity, hell-bent on killing Bonnie to revive Elena. God!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Bonnie appears in the doorway, looking weak and woozy as blood pours from both nostrils]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[worriedly]</i> Bonnie?

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, you're just gonna have to settle for the ornery brother.

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: What's that putrid smell?

<dl><dd> DAMON: Are we really doing this?

<dl><dd> JULIAN: Yes, we're really doing this. You know, I've never had the opportunity to share war stories with another Stone survivor. Come on. How'd you fare? Tell me everything.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Gladly. As soon as Stefan's home and his soul sucked out of that rock, we can all sit and pop open a bottle of chardonnay, chat, and eat bonbons 'til the sun comes up.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Heh heh. Hmm. Perhaps I should start. See, upon waking up in that wretched world, I saw your mother... And then I killed her. Every day for over a century, I watched her die. Every day for over a century, I had my heart torn out of my chest. Oh, it was complete and utter misery.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I had a slightly different experience. Overall, I give hell one star for horror and two <i>very</i> disappointed thumbs down for clever use of parable.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: <i>[curiously]</i> So, it didn't work on you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[shrugs]</i> It was called hell. Let's just say I had expectations.

<dl><dd> JULIAN: I think you simply resisted.

<p><i>[Henry becomes even more concerned as Damon rises to his feet and holds the letter up]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: MAIL!
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Damon reawakens once again on the cot to Henry smiling at him, though he doesn't sit up. This starts a new montage of Civil War flashbacks]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> HENRY: Hi there, hero. You've been out a long time.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[The scene cuts to Damon in the Colonel's tent, where he has just requested his two weeks of leave]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> COLONEL: And, if you bring the deserters back to me, then you shall have your leave, Salvatore.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[curiously]</i> Does the offer still stand if I bring them back dead?
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[The scene cuts to inside the farmhouse, where Damon walks into the kitchen and shoots at the pantry's shelf two times. After a moment, the door falls open, revealing that Damon's shot hit both of them in the back of the head. When he sees their bodies, he smiles in satisfaction until he hears a gun cocking behind him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Damnit.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He turns to find the grandmother with a shotgun aimed at him, and she sneers as she pulls the trigger]</i>

<p><i>[Damon reawakens on the cot in the field hospital after the flashbacks have reset themselves yet again. Henry smiles at him as he sits up]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> HENRY: Hi there, hero. You've been out a long time.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The mail soldier arrives and walks toward them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MAIL SOLDIER: Mail call!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[annoyed]</i> Screw this.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon grabs his bag, his uniform jacket, and his compass, and starts walking away from the tent as Henry chases after him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> HENRY: Damon, where are you going?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You know what the shortest distance between Point A and Point B is, Henry?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> HENRY: <i>[confused]</i> What?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: A straight line. To get out of this hell, I've got to see my brother, so I'm going straight to him. I'm deserting to Mystic Falls.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> HENRY: <i>[surprised]</i> Really? Can I come with you?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon walks forward a few steps as he reaches into his pocket, not looking Henry in the eyes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You know how you always say I'm a hero, Henry?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon pulls a grenade out of his pocket and pulls the pin before throwing it toward him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'm no hero.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Henry backs away from the live grenade as a man from the camp shouts out a warning while Damon walks away from them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> SOLDIER: Grenade!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The grenade explodes behind him]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Damon continues walking through the woods, whistling the Star-Spangled Banner (the United States' national anthem) as he checks his compass to make sure he's going the right way. However, when he comes upon the same farmhouse where the deserters were hiding in the other versions of the flashback, he looks stunned]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No way...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, the front door opens, and Lily walks out onto the porch in the same blue gown as before. Damon looks even more surprised to see her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Come in. We've been expecting you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon reluctantly comes inside and is surprised to find that neither the Union-sympathizing women nor the Confederate deserters from earlier are nowhere in sight]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, this is different. Where the hell is everybody?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily looks out the window with a grim expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Keep your voice down. I can see them coming in the distance.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[confused]</i> Who?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: Confederates are hunting deserters. They <i>will</i> kill you. You need to hide in the cellar.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[annoyed]</i> Okay, this whole urgency-thing isn't necessary because this isn't actually happening.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[frustrated]</i> Damon, you are not hearing me. They are here. Get down to the cellar if you want to live.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon reluctantly does as he's told, and is surprised to find Stefan, in mid-19th century era clothing, waiting for him. He's sitting on what looks like a piece of furniture covered up by a cream-colored sheet]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Brother.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, well. If it isn't the light at the end of the tunnel.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[smiles fakely]</i> Pretty dark tunnel, this little slaughterhouse. I can see why you never told me about it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I was trying to protect your fragile emotions, Stefan. You're the reason I took the mission to begin with.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan chuckles patronizingly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You always have a reason, don't you, Damon? Brother, drinking buddy...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan bends over and removes the sheet, revealing that Elena's coffin is what was hidden underneath]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>Her</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> Elena? You're gonna have to do a <i>lot</i> better than that. Proving that I do bad things for the people I love?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: This isn't about what you do in her name, Damon. It's about what you do in her absence!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, they hear a knock on the door upstairs, and Stefan puts a finger to his lips]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Shhh. Quiet. They're here.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[annoyed]</i> What the hell is going on?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You don't get it, do you? You tell yourself that you're protecting Mystic Falls for Elena. You convince yourself that you're keeping her safe by any means necessary. You justify punishing Lily for Elena's sake. Did you ever once think, "What would Elena do?"
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[angrily]</i> I never got a chance to ask her, thanks to Lily.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[smiles]</i> Ah, so you <i>had</i> to ask! Is Elena's influence on you so weak that you can't tell right from wrong without her holding your hand?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Upstairs, a Confederate soldier's voice is heard talking to Lily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> SOLDIER: <i>Where are you hiding him?</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks at Damon with a smug expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Oooh. <i>[He clicks his tongue]</i> It's gonna be a long century, brother. You know, I wonder if she'll even recognize you when she wakes up...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Upstairs, Lily's voice is heard talking to the Confederate soldier while the brothers talk]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> LILY: <i>There's no one here, I promise you. There's no one here!</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> SOLDIER: <i>Let us inside, ma'am.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[frustrated]</i> What?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: The man who spit on our mother's grave. The man who lies to himself even now about what happened here today?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: What are you talking about?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan glares at Damon as the Confederate soldier and Lily fight upstairs]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> LILY: <i>What are you doing? Get your hands off of me! No, no, no! Stop! Stop! No!</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, a gunshot is heard, and Lily screams before she falls to the ground]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> LILY: <i>Ahhh!</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan grabs Damon by the lapels and pushes him against the wall]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: She's gone!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[horrified]</i> What are you doing to me?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily's blood starts to pour between the floorboards of the kitchen and land on Damon's face, slowly coating him with blood]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: The mission went sideways. Innocents died, and you walked away with blood on your hands. What did you want?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[angrily]</i> I wanted my brother.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>What did you want?</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[louder]</i> My brother.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[aggressively]</i> What did you want?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[furiously]</i> I wanted my brother!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[louder]</i> Stop lying to yourself! Who did you want in that moment? Before you buried all your secrets? Before you learned how to hide from your pain?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, overwhelmed with emotion, struggles to speak]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I... I wanted... <i>My mother</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan finally lets go of Damon and smirks]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Oh. Well, it's too late.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan throws Damon against the wall]</i>

<p><i>[Suddenly, Damon awakens on the battlefield at the Confederate front lines, where night has fallen. Dozens of bodies are strewn throughout the forest, and several small fires are burning as a result of landmines blowing up. Damon looks around at all the soldiers moaning in pain and sees that the front of his uniform is also soaked in blood from his own wounds as well. Suddenly, Lily, who is bleeding from her head and who is pinned under the wheel of a cannon like Henry was at the beginning of the episode, starts to cry out for him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Damon! Damon, can you move? Please. Please, you must help me.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon rolls onto his side to look closer at Lily, who is struggling to get out from under the cannon]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[groans]</i> Why? This isn't real.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[As Damon stands to his feet, bullets start to whiz past him, one of which hits him in the thigh]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Ugh!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[tearfully]</i> Pain is real. Feeling is real.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon gets hit in the arm with another bullet, and though he groans in pain, he also starts to laugh weakly, which disturbs Lily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: You love this, don't you? I'm gonna die knowing my own son hates me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yes, he does.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: Why?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Because you tried to take Elena away from me.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, the cannon wheel collapses, and the cannon pins Lily's legs even harder underneath it, causing her to cry out in pain]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Ow! Ahh! AHHH!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon jumps in fright from the cannon falling and starts to look worried about her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Ohh! Ahhh! Why won't you help me? Please! Oh! Ahhh!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When Damon just stands there, she looks at him in horror]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Why? Ahh!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon stumbles over to her and kneels next to her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Because you took the one thing that made me happy. Because you weren't strong enough to leave your husband. Because you got sick and left us. Because you never came back!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily seems somewhat relieved to hear Damon telling the truth, but continues to groan in pain under the cannon]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: UGH! Argh!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I hate you because you could've come back so many times, but you never did. I lost you the first time when Father sent you away with consumption, and then we brought you back from this prison world, and then I lost you again to your other family. And now, I'm losing you to death. <i>Three times</i>, I lost you. Three times, I had the chance to tell you everything I want to tell you, and three times I ruined it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily looks even more relieved and proud to hear this]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Oh, my... my sweet boy...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She and Damon both sniffle as they begin to cry]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: There's still time. Tell me. Tell me what you want to say. Tell me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sobs]</i> Mama, I'm so sorry. Give me the chance to make it right. Give me a chance to let you love me, okay?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, the life leaves Lily's eyes, and Damon realizes that she's dead]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No. No. No.

<p><i>[Bonnie is holding Damon's hand as she quietly casts the spell in the upstairs living room, when suddenly, he gasps awake, the Phoenix Stone still on his chest. Stefan, Matt, and Caroline, who were silently sitting around on the chairs and couches, look shocked to see Damon awake, but Damon is only thinking about what just happened with Lily and doesn't realize that this isn't a part of his hellscape, but actually real life]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No. No. No.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan stands to his feet and rushes over to his brother, who has just sit up and is panicking about what just happened]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No, we weren't done! I gotta get her back. I gotta get her back!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, still not realizing he's alive again, stands to his feet as Stefan stands in front of him and tries to calm him down, though it's clear that he's worried]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hey, its me. It's me! You're safe. It's okay. It's okay.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[frantically]</i> No. No! One more time. One more time!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon turns around to look at Bonnie, who is seriously weakened as a result of the spell and who is being held up by Caroline]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Send me back. I know what to do now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Damon, it's not real--
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[cuts him off]</i> I know it's not real. None of this is real!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, thinking that this is just part of the Phoenix Stone's hell, starts to attack under the mistaken belief that doing so will reset the "test" so he can start over from the beginning. He grabs Stefan by the arm and breaks it before reaching up and snapping his neck. Matt, seriously concerned, stands to his feet as Caroline rushes over to help Stefan]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Damon, don't--
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon smashes a chair and uses the broken chair leg as a stake, which he stabs into Caroline's chest, causing her to gasp in pain. She falls backward into Bonnie's arms as Matt rushes toward them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: DAMON!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon backhands Matt so hard that his neck is snapped as well, and he falls to the ground]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[horrified]</i> Oh, no--
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon grabs a fireplace poker and vamp-speeds over to Bonnie, pinning her to the wall by using the poker to press against her throat, choking her. Bonnie desperately gasps for breath and tries to reason with him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Oh! UGH! Damon-- Ahhh!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[frantically]</i> I have to get back to her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[chokes]</i> Ugh!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Finally, it appears that Bonnie either dies or loses consciousness, and she falls to the ground. Damon drops the poker onto the ground, but becomes even more frantic when he isn't sent back like he expected]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Why am I still here? It wasn't real... This isn't real...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon looks around in horror at Bonnie, Matt, Caroline, and Stefan's bodies all strewn around the room from where he attacked them and begins to panic]</i>
