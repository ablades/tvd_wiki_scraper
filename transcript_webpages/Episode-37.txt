 Gilbert Lake House 

[Elena is sitting on the sofa, reading one of Johnathan Gilbert's journals.]

 Gilbert Residence 1864 

Johnathan: (voiceover) With the dying embers of the fire at Fell's Church, the scourge of the vampires had passed. And though war raged all around us, our town was safe from the demons of the night...Or so we thought.

[At the Gilbert house of the past. Jon Gilbert, Honoria, and Thomas Fell are enjoying dinner and some wine. A man walks across the yard, outside, and up towards the house.]

 Gilbert Lake House 

[Elena flips to the next page of the journal and reads it with interest.]

 Gilbert Residence 1864 

Johnathan: (voiceover) For the monsters we drove to their fiery deaths had begat new monsters.

[Outside of the house, the Fells and Jon hear a creaking board being unsettled by footsteps. They look over at the window.]

Honoria: Did you hear that?

[Thomas walks over to the window and peers out. There is no one in sight. Thomas picks up a knife from the table.]

Thomas: Stay here.

Honoria: No, Thomas.

Thomas: It's all right, dear, the vampires are all dead.

Johnathan: Yes, Honoria...they burned in the church. We're safe now.

[Thomas walks out of the house, leaving the front door open behind him. Honoria still looks worried.]

Honoria: Please, Johnathan. I'm worried.

Johnathan: Very well. I shall go too.

[Johnathan gets up from the table and walks outside. Thomas is in the yard, searching around, with the knife pointed out in defense. Johnathan walks towards him.]

Johnathan: I can prove there are no vampires.

[Thomas looks at him. Johnathan pulls out the vampire compass and holds it out. Nothing happens.]

Johnathan: See?

[For a moment, Thomas looks relieved. But, the arrow of the compass starts spinning around and around at an incredible speed. Johnathan looks down at it and tries to follow the direction the arrow is pointing. When he turns back around, Thomas has disappeared.]

Johnathan: Thomas? Thomas?!

[Johnathan walks down from the porch and looks around. His eyes are wide with fear. Suddenly, behind Johnathan, Thomas' body falls from the sky. Johnathan turns around and looks down at the body. Honoria has come out onto the porch and runs towards Thomas.]

Honoria: Thomas!

Johnathan: No, stay inside! Get back in the house!

[The vampire rushes onto the porch and grabs Honoria. He bites into her throat and drains her of her blood. She falls down on the floor, dead. Johnathan watches as the vampire slowly turns to look at him.]

Johnathan: (voiceover) I knew I was about to die. You can not run from a vampire. I saw the vampire who killed me. I recognized him. It was Stefan Salvatore.

[Stefan walks over to Johnathan, blood running down his chin, bites him and kills him.]

 Gilbert Lake House 

[Elena looks up from the journal with a shocked expression. She looks out the window at Stefan who is on the dock.]
[Outside, Stefan is on the dock, skipping stones across the lake. His phone rings and he answers it. Damon is on the other end.]

Stefan: What's going on?

Damon: Well, I showered. I shaved. Had breakfast. Very relaxed.

Stefan: That makes one of us.

Damon: I did hear one piece of good news though. Tyler Lockwood ran away from home last night.

Stefan: How do you know?

Damon: Well, I heard it from Sheriff Forbes, who heard it from a very distraught Carol Lockwood, thus, ending our werewolf chapter, bringing us to...

Stefan: ...killing Elijah.

Damon: Exactly.

Stefan: Well, it's not going to be easy. He's crafty.

Damon: Well, I've got a crafty little dagger.

Stefan: He's an Original. We don't know what all that encompasses.

Damon: Oh, trust me, Stefan. I'm gonna dot all my t's. I don't want any surprises.

Stefan: Wow, Damon, tell me you're actually gonna be careful for once?

Damon: Yes, Stefan, I've become you. How tragic for both of us. Got to run. I've a murder to plan. Busy day.

[Damon hangs up. Stefan lowers his phone and looks at Elena through the window. He walks back up to the house.]

 Old Fell Property 

[Jenna is taking Elijah on a tour of some of the historical sights of Mystic Falls.]

Jenna: The old Fell property actually starts just beyond that fence.

Elijah: Ah, the Fells. One of the Founding Families.

Jenna: Why do you say it like that?

Elijah: My research showed me that this area was actually settled almost two full centuries earlier. It was a migration of townsfolk from the northeast, um, it was Salem, to be precise.

Jenna: Massachusetts? As in the witch trials?

Elijah: Which means the ever-lauded founding families...didn't actually found anything.

Jenna: Well, I bet it was the men who made a big deal about being founders back in 1860. Men are very territorial.

Elijah: Yes, they are.

[Alaric walks up to the pair of them.]

Jenna: Elijah, this is my friend, Alaric Saltzman.

Alaric: Yeah, I got your message about walking Elijah here through the old property lines. I thought I would tag along. You know being a history buff and all. Where to next?

Elijah: I'm pretty curious about the freed slave property owners. Some say, you know, the descendents of the slaves are the true keepers of American history.

Jenna: Well, I only brought the surveys. I got that list in the car. Just give me a sec.

[Jenna walks back to her car, leaving the two men alone together.]

Elijah: Alaric Saltzman. So you're one of those people on Elena's list of loved ones to protect.

Alaric: So is Jenna.

Elijah: You don't have to be jealous. I don't really pursue younger women. It's a joke, Ric, lighten up.

[Elijah pats him on the shoulder and walks away.]

Alaric: Right.

 Mystic Grill 

[Bonnie is sitting alone at a table. Jeremy walks in, sees her, and smiles. He walks over to her and sits down with her.]

Jeremy: Hey, whatcha doin'?

Bonnie: Thinking about last night.

Jeremy: Yeah, yeah. Me too.

Bonnie: It was a tough spell. I could feel it draining me. I need practice.

Jeremy: Yeah, well, uh, maybe, I don't know...Maybe you should come over tonight. We can practice. Get stronger.

Bonnie: Yeah, sure. Thanks.

[Luka walks into the Grill. Jeremy sees him.]

Jeremy: Ah, incoming.

[Luka walks over to their table.]

Luka: You want to tell me what the hell happened yesterday?

Bonnie: Sorry?

Luka: Don't play dumb. You both were here and...

Jeremy: And?

Luka: And that's all I remember. One minute I'm playing pool and the next I'm waking up in a bathroom stall.

Bonnie: Sorry, Luka, but everything seemed normal yesterday. I mean, I brought you a coffee and we played pool.

Luka: See, I think you're lying.

[Jeremy gets up and shoves Luka away from Bonnie.]

Jeremy: And I think you need to back off.

[Luka looks at them and leaves.]

 Gilbert Lake House 

[Elena is still reading Jon Gilbert's journal. She jumps when she hears Stefan open the door and enter the room. He takes his jacket off and looks at her.]

Elena: Are you still mad?

Stefan: Yeah, I'm still mad.

Elena: We have a difference of opinion, Stefan. We're not always gonna agree on everything.

Stefan: Elena, you've agreed to sacrifice yourself to Klaus. To say that we have a difference of opinion is the understatement of the century.

Elena: You would know.

[He looks down at the journal.]

Stefan: What does Johnathan Gilbert have to say?

Elena: A lot. It's insane the things he wrote in his journal.?

[She hands Stefan the journal and he opens it.]

Elena: That he kept from the founding families. Stuff that nobody knows. Stuff that...you never told me.

[She looks at Stefan. Stefan looks down at what she just read and closes the journal.]

Stefan: We were, uh...We were angry at the founding families for what they did to Katherine. We wanted revenge. I didn't know about Johnathan Gilbert's ring yet. I didn't know that he would (He sits down)...that he would survive.

Elena: He describes you as a monster.

Stefan: That's what I was. I want you to know the truth...But I want you to hear it from me. In the weeks after I became a vampire, I relished in it. I took it to the darkest place I could.

 Salvatore Boarding House 1864 

[Stefan is draining the blood from a woman. She dies and Stefan lies back on the couch, breathing heavily. His shirt and chin are stained with blood. Nearby, two women dance while another woman plays the piano. Stefan gets up.]

Stefan: Who wants to die next?

[The two women walk over to him.]

Woman: Me, I'm next.

Other woman: Me, you promised me.

[He caresses their chins and then looks at the woman playing piano. He walks over towards her and grabs her face in his hands.]

Stefan: What about you? You know if you don't pick up the tempo, you're going to lose your head. Snap. Snap.

[The woman picks up the tempo. Stefan rushes over to one of the women who was dancing and starts to drink from her. Damon walks into the room.]

Damon: Company, brother?

[Stefan stops drinking and looks at Damon.]

Stefan: I brought enough to share.

[Stefan throws the other girl towards Damon. Damon grabs her.]

Damon: Are you mad bringing them here when the entire town is hunting us?

[Stefan walks over to him.]

Stefan: Damon, if you're worried about the Founding Families, please don't be. They're all dead or about to be.

[Stefan looks back at the woman he was drinking from. She smiles at him and he proceeds to start drinking from her neck again. Damon grabs the other woman's face in his hands and compels her.]

Damon: Leave this place. Never think of it again.

[Damon walks over to Stefan and rips him off the other woman. He compels her as well. Stefan growls in fury.]

Damon: Same for you. Leave this place. Never think of it again.

Stefan: Damon, don't be like this. I'm just having some fun.

Damon: Staying alive is more fun, Stefan. We have to be more careful than this. More clever. Like Katherine was.

Stefan: Look where that got her.

Damon: I'm done here. With you. I'm leaving town.

[Damon walks past Stefan. Stefan rushes in front of Damon and grabs him by the shoulders.]

Stefan: You hate me. I know. I know. An eternity of misery and on and on. I know, but you don't have to leave town. Damon, I'll do better. I promise.

Damon: No, you will get us killed. I'd rather leave you to do that to yourself.

[Stefan is upset by Damon wanting to leave him. Damon pushes Stefan off of him and walks out of the house.]

 Gilbert Lake House 

Stefan: I wasn't myself then. I was full of guilt. What I did to my father, to my brother. I had to turn it off. It was the only way I could survive.

Elena: It sounds like you were Damon.

Stefan: I was worse.

 Mystic Grill 

[Alaric, Damon and Andie are at a table.]

Damon: Other than your lecture on the history of Mystic Falls, did you get anything out of Elijah?

Alaric: No, it was boring. Of course, Jenna thinks he's charming.

Damon: You sounded jealous. Sound a bit jealous?

Andie: Kinda do.

Alaric: Maybe we shouldn't talk about this here.

[Alaric glances over at Andie.]

Damon: Andie, she's been compelled not to divulge my secrets. Haven't you?

Andie: Uh-huh.

[Damon and Andie kiss.]

Andie: Mmm. My lips are sealed.

[Alaric stares at them in disgust.]

Alaric: This is too weird.

Damon: I just need the right opportunity.

[Damon sees Elijah and Jenna enter the Grill.]

Damon: Ah, there's Jenna with her new boyfriend. Hi.

[Elijah and Jenna walk up to their table.]

Jenna: Hey, guys.

Damon: So I hear you two had quite a meeting of historical minds today.

Jenna: Yeah, I guess you could say that.

Alaric: Well, as much as I'd like to continue this, I've got papers to grade.

[Alaric puts down some money and gets up from the table.]

Andie: No, you know what? We should continue this. Let's have a dinner party.

Damon: Ooh, my girl. Full of good ideas. I'll be happy to host. Say tonight. Maybe?

Andie: It's good for me. Jenna?

Alaric: I don't know if tonight works...

Jenna: Yeah, I'm free.

Elijah: It'd be a pleasure.

Damon: Great.

 Fell's Church Tomb 

[Katherine's body has desiccated. Damon waves a bottle of blood under her nose and pours some in her mouth. She starts to drink.]

Damon: Great. Drink up. Good girl.

[She takes the bottle out of his hands and continues to drink. Damon gets up.]

Damon: I've come bearing gifts. I didn't have time to properly shop, but I did get a couple of things. Hmm?

[He hangs some clothes on the iron grating for Katherine. Katherine looks normal again and crushes the empty blood bottle in her hands. Damon looks down at her.]

Damon: Wow, that blood did the trick. You're almost pretty again.

Katherine: What is it you want, Damon?

Damon: Guess who's back in town? Your old friend, John Gilbert.

Katherine: Really. Why?

Damon: Says he loves his daughter, wants to protect her from Elijah and big, bad Klaus.

Katherine: Touching.

[Katherine pulls herself up from the ground.]

Damon: Yeah, right. He told me this old wives tale about how to kill an Original.

Katherine: And you want to know if it's true. If it was, I wouldn't tell you.

[Katherine goes over to the clothes Damon has hung up and grabs a jacket off the hanger.]

Damon: Now, why not? I mean, you want Elijah and Klaus dead as much as I do.

Katherine: Klaus, yes. Elijah, no. He's compelled me to stay in here. If he dies, I'm stuck forever.

Damon: Sucks for you.

Katherine: Forget it, Damon. Killing Elijah would be a suicide mission. You can't do it.

Damon: Can so.

Katherine: Can't.

Damon: Even with a dagger and a little white oak ash?

[She turns and looks at him with an expression of surprise.]

Katherine: No. Damon, if you kill Elijah, then I'm stuck in here forever.

Damon: You're really scared.

Katherine: Just get me out of here first and then I'll help you. I'll...I'll help you kill Elijah or...or protect Elena. Whatever you want.

Damon: I get you out of here and your ass is sipping Klaus-free margaritas on some unknown island somewhere. No way.

Katherine: That's not true. I'll stay. Damon, please just don't do it.

Damon: Well, thank you, you've told me everything I need to know.

Katherine: I've told you nothing.

Damon: You have. You have indeed confirmed that it is possible to kill an Original, which I will do tonight. Guess who's coming to dinner?

 Gilbert Lake House 

[Elena is leaning against the back door, looking out at the lake. Stefan walks up to her and hands her a mug of tea.]

Stefan: For weeks I kept spiraling. I was completely driven by the desire for blood. Hunt, prey, kill. That was all I knew.

Elena: How come no one caught on to what you were doing?

Stefan: Mmm. There was a war going on. The thing about wartime. Endless, anonymous blood supply.

 Woods 1864 

[There is a camp set up for the sick and injured Civil War soldiers. Stefan is drinking the blood from a man who appears to be already dead. He looks up and sees a female hooded figure feeding a bowl of soup to another injured man. The hooded figure stands up and walks away into the woods. Stefan follows her. The hooded person stops and Stefan rushes away. She looks behind herself, but doesn't see anyone. Stefan starts rushing around her and eventually falls down on top of her, but she is too quick and catches Stefan, pinning him to the floor. The hooded figure is Lexi. Her face is vamped out as she looks down at Stefan.]

Lexi: What kind of an idiot are you?

 Gilbert Lake House 

Stefan: Alexia Branson, as she was known back then.

Elena: Lexi? Your best friend Lexi? That's how you met her? What was she even doing in Mystic Falls?

Stefan: She had heard it was a good place for vampires. You know, had no idea that they'd all been massacred. Needed a place to crash, so I brought her home with me.

 Salvatore Boarding House 1864 

[Lexi and Stefan enter the Salvatore house.]

Lexi: I'd say it isn't necessary to take me in, but you did try to eat me and well, with dawn coming, beggars can't be choosers.?

[Lexi looks in the parlor room and sees the dead bodies of women lying around.]

Lexi: Or should they be?

Stefan: I, um...I meant to dispose of those.

Lexi: My God, you're a ripper.

Stefan: A what?

Lexi: There are good parts of being a vampire and there are bad parts. You're the bad parts. Well...we're going to have to change that.

 Gilbert Lake House 

Elena: Are you okay?

Stefan: Talking about her brings up things that I'd rather forget.

Elena: Like Damon killing her?

 Salvatore Boarding House 

[Jenna and Andie are preparing the table for the dinner party.]

Andie: So what's going on with you and Alaric? I feel like there's some tension.

Jenna: I don't know. I really like him. It's more than like and I want it to work, but I can't help but feel that he's hiding something from me. And then I've got John whispering things in my ear about him.

Andie: Like what?

Jenna: Things I don't want to believe. Things I don't believe, not if they're coming from John's mouth.

Andie: Oh. Well, there you go, then. Trust is the key to any relationship. I mean, I am so grateful that Damon tells me everything.

[Damon and Alaric are in the library.]

Alaric: This is a bad idea.

Damon: There's no such thing as a bad idea. Just poorly executed awesome ones. Here.

[He hands Alaric a glass of scotch, but he refuses it.]

Alaric: No. I don't like the idea of Elijah being in the same house with Jenna.

Damon: Jenna's perfectly safe. Besides, it's just a fact-finding mission. It's totally harmless.

Alaric: Just a fact-finding mission?

Damon: Yeah.

Alaric: Listen, no sneak attacks. No surprise plans. Nothing that's gonna put Jenna in harm's way. Okay?

Damon: Scout's honor.

[Damon puts up his hand and grabs Alaric's shoulder. Alaric looks at him, still suspicious. Andie walks in.]

Andie: Hey, Jenna needs help with the wine.

[Damon looks at him, smiles, and pats his arm reassuringly. Alaric walks up the stairs.]

Andie: Thanks.

Alaric: Yeah.

[He leaves the room and closes the door. Damon waits until he is sure he is gone before he walks over to a small trunk and opens it. He pulls out the silver dagger and white oak ash from inside. Andie walks down to him.]

Andie: What's that?

Damon: Dessert.

[He dips the dagger in the ash.]

Damon: Elijah's stronger than me. Faster than me. It's all about the element of surprise.

Andie: Ah, it's too bad. I like him. He's very old-school. Classy.

Damon: Which is why you should encourage the gentlemen to take their after dinner drinks in here while you do coffee in the kitchen with the girls.

[Damon places the dagger with the glasses and the scotch, hiding it from view.]

Andie: Hmm. That is a little too sexist for me.

[Damon turns around and looks at her.]

Damon: Stop talking.

[Andie smiles at him.]
[Upstairs, the bell rings. Jenna answers the door. John is outside on the porch and walks into the house. Damon walks out of the library and into the front hall.]

Jenna: Who invited him?

Damon: John. Surprise. Leave.

John: When Jenna told me she was coming to a dinner party for Elijah, I decided I couldn't miss out on all the fun and games.

[Alaric walks in. Damon and John look at him.]

Alaric: There are not going to be any games tonight, John. It's just a friendly dinner party.

[John looks back at Damon.]

Damon: What he said.

 Gilbert Residence 

[Jeremy opens the front door for Bonnie.]

Jeremy: Hey.

Bonnie: Hey.

[He takes her bag.]

Bonnie: Thanks. That thing weighs a ton. I'm starving. You guys have any...food?

[She stops in front of the living room. There are candles lit and placed all over the room. She looks nervous.]

Bonnie: Oh, God. Heh! This is a date.

[Jeremy walks into the room and stands in front of her.]

Jeremy: No, no it's not like a "date" date. It's more of a hey, I kissed you, and I thought you liked it, um...hang thing.

Bonnie: Jeremy, I need to make sure Elena is cool with us before anything else happens.

[He turns away and places her stuff on the couch.]

Jeremy: I didn't realize my sister had approval over who I'm with.

Bonnie: She's my best friend. I tell her everything and this whole hang thing might freak her out.

Jeremy: All right, all right, so we'll, um...We'll hang out, eat some food, work on some spells. It's not a big deal. But you did...You did like it, right?

[She smiles.]

Bonnie: Yeah. I liked it.

 Salvatore Boarding House 

[Damon opens the door. Elijah is outside.]

Elijah: Good evening.

Damon: Thank you for coming. Please, come in.

Elijah: Just one moment. Can I just say that if you have less than honorable intentions about how this evening is going to proceed, I suggest you reconsider.

Damon: No, nothing, nothing dishonorable. Just getting to know you.

Elijah: Hmm. Well, that's good.

[Elijah enters the house.]

Elijah: Because, you know, although Elena and I have this deal, if you so much as make a move to cross me, I'll kill you and I'll kill everyone in this house. Are we clear?

Damon: Crystal.

[Elijah sees Jenna, smiles, and walks over to her.]

Elijah: Jenna. Wonderful to see you again. How are you??

Jenna: Nice to see you.

Elijah: You look incredible.

Jenna: Thank you.

[Damon shuts the front door.]
[Damon, Andie, Elijah, Jenna, John, and Alaric all sit around the table. Jenna pours some wine for Damon.]

Jenna: I hate to break it to you, Damon, but according to Elijah, your family is so not a founder of this town.

Damon: Hmm, do tell.

Elijah: Well, as I mentioned to Jenna earlier, a faction of settlers migrated from Salem after the witch trials in the 1690s. Over the next hundred years they developed this community where they could feel safe from persecution.

Jenna: Hmm. Because they were witches.

Andie: Yeah, but there's no tangible proof there were witches in Salem.

Damon: Andie's a journalist. Big on facts.

Elijah: Well, the lore says that there was this wave of anti-witch hysteria. It broke out in the neighboring settlement, so these witches were rounded up. They were tied to stakes in a field together and, uh, burned. Some say you could hear the screams from miles around us. They were consumed by the fire. Could you pass the...

Jenna: I wouldn't repeat this to the Historical Society.

John: It's starting to sound a little like a ghost story to me.

Damon: So, why do you want to know the location of these alleged massacres?

Elijah: You know...a healthy historian's curiosity, of course.

Damon: Of course.

[He glances at Damon and smiles, nervously.]

 Gilbert Lake House 

[Elena is again sitting on the couch reading another of Johnathan Gilbert's journals. Stefan walks in the house and over to her.]

Elena: Johnathan Gilbert got crazier and crazier. I guess that's what happens when you spend your life obsessed with vampires.

[She puts the journal down and picks up another. She begins to read and as she does her brow furrows.]

Elena: He researched the Originals.

Stefan: You're kidding.

[He walks over to the couch and sits down next to her.]

Elena: Later in life, look.

[She shows him the journal.]

Elena: Pages and pages of questions and scribbles.

[Elena flips through the pages and eventually stops on one. A picture of the silver dagger has been drawn on it.]

Elena: What's that?

[Her and Stefan look at each other for a moment. She looks back down and starts to read aloud.]

Elena: "The wood from one tree and one tree alone, an ancient white oak would bring death to an Original vampire. When the tree burned, all hope was thought lost." He was trying to figure out how to kill an Original.

[She looks back down at the journal and continues to read out loud again.]

Elena: "But the ash from the tree was saved and witches forged a dagger to which the ash could be bonded. This alchemic bond provides the necessary poison"

[Stefan gets up and stands in front of her.]

Stefan: Elena...

Elena: I wonder if this is true. I mean, do you think this dagger actually exists?

Stefan: I know it does...

[Elena looks up at him, shocked.]

Stefan: Because John gave it to Damon.

Elena: John gave Damon the weapon that's supposed to kill Elijah? This one?

[Elena points at the dagger on the page and Stefan nods. She starts to read aloud again.]

Elena: "It must be brandished by humans alone, for it will bring death to all demons who wield it."

[Stefan grabs the journal from Elena and looks at it. He quickly grabs out his phone and dials Damon.]

Stefan: John's trying to get Damon killed.

 Salvatore Boarding House 

Damon: Would anyone care for some cognac? I have a bottle that I've been saving for ages.

[Damon gets up from the table.]

Alaric: None for me thanks. Nine bottles of wine is my limit.

 Gilbert Lake House 

[Damon doesn't answer his phone.]

Stefan: Why is your phone off? Call me.

[Elena looks up at him.]

Elena: What's going on, Stefan?

Stefan: Damon is planning on killing Elijah. Tonight.

 Salvatore Boarding House 

[The others start to get up. Damon looks at Andie.]

Andie: The gentlemen should take their drinks in the study.

Elijah: I have to say the food was almost as wonderful as the company.

Andie: I like you.

[Jenna hands some plates to John.]

Jenna: Here you are, gentleman, make yourself useful. Hmm?

[John takes the plates and walks off. Alaric comes up behind Jenna.]

Alaric: Here, here. Put me to work.

Jenna: Um, I got it.

[Jenna picks up the plates and starts to walk out of the room. Alaric stops her.]

Alaric: Hey, Jenna, are you...are you okay?

Jenna: Yeah, fine, Ric.

[Jenna leaves the room. John looks at Alaric and walks towards him.]

John: I suspect this is my fault.

Alaric: What did you do now?

John: I merely mentioned that you haven't been completely honest with her about your dead wife.

Alaric: You son of a bitch!

[Alaric grabs John by his shirt collar. John grabs his wrists and pulls his hands off of him.]

John: I think I've been very clear with you, Ric. I want my ring back.

[John walks out of the room. Alaric's phone starts to ring. He answers it.]

Alaric: Hello. Slow down. Slow down. Stefan?

[Damon and Elijah are in the library. Damon is pouring drinks for the men.]

Damon: So, let me guess. In addition to the moonstone, the doppelgänger, the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, you need to find this witch burial ground.

Elijah: Because I feel as though we've grown so close, Damon, I'll tell you yes. Do you know where it is?

Damon: Maybe. Tell me why it's so important.

[Damon hands Elijah a glass of scotch. He takes it.]

Elijah: We're not that close.

[Elijah turns around and looks around at the books.]

Elijah: It's quite a collection you have here.

Damon: Hmm.

[As Elijah has his back turned, Damon slowly and carefully grabs the silver dagger from the tray of glasses.]

Elijah: It's a funny thing about books. Before they existed, people actually had memories.

[Alaric and Andie burst through the study doors. Damon quickly puts the dagger back down.]

Alaric: Gentlemen, we forgot about dessert.

Andie: Elijah.

[Andie holds her hand out for him.]

Elijah: Miss Star...

[Elijah hands his glass to Damon, who drains it, and takes Andie's hand. He twirls her around and they walk out of the room together. As soon as they leave, Damon smacks Alaric angrily. Alaric points down at the dagger. Damon doesn't understand what he means. Alaric walks over to a desk and writes something down on a piece of paper. He hands it to Damon who reads it. The paper says "The dagger will kill you if you use it." Damon angrily throws the paper at Alaric and they walk out of the room.]
[Back in the dining room, Jenna pours coffee into a cup for John. Elijah and Andie enter the room.]

Jenna: Sorry, guys, dessert is taking longer than I thought. I usually just unwrap food.

Andie: So...I know this is a social thing, but I...I would really love to ask you some more questions about the work that you're doing here.

Elijah: I'd love to answer.

Andie: Great, that's so great.

[Damon and Alaric enter the room. Damon sits down and glares across the table at John.]

Andie: Ric, would you do me a favor and grab the notebook out of my bag?

[Alaric walks over to her bag.]

Damon: Elijah, did John tell you he's Elena's uncle-slash-father?

Elijah: Yes, I'm well aware of that.

Damon: Of course, she hates him, so there's absolutely no need to keep him on the endangered species list.

[Damon looks back at him.]

Andie: No Ric, it's in the front pocket. On the...you know what? Excuse me, guys. Sorry.

[She gets up to help Ric find her notebook.]

John: What I'd like to know, Elijah, is how do you intend on killing Klaus?

Elijah: Gentlemen, there's a few things we should probably get clear right now. I allow you to live solely to keep an eye on Elena. I allow Elena to remain in her house living her life with her friends as she does as a courtesy. If you become a liability, I'll take her away from you and you'll never see her again.

[Andie comes back with her notebook and sits down.]

Andie: Okay. My first question is when you got here to Mystic...

[Alaric comes up behind Elijah and stabs the dagger through his heart through the back of his chair. Elijah screams and dies. Everyone at the table gets up in shock. Alaric pulls the dagger out and places it on the table. He looks at Damon.]

Alaric: Now, get rid of him before Jenna comes back with dessert.

Damon: All right.

 Gilbert Lake House 

[Elena is standing outside on the balcony. Stefan walks out and over to her.]

Stefan: Elena, we need to talk about this.

Elena: What good is talking if you and Damon are just gonna lie to me? If you don't like my decisions, that's fine. There's nothing I can do about that but if you ever go behind my back again, I'll...

Stefan: You're gonna what? Hmm? What are you gonna do, Elena?

Elena: It's my life.

Stefan: Yeah, exactly. It's your life and I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure that you live it.

Elena: Then what? This...this...this trip through the past. You being honest. Was there any truth to that or were you just distracting me?

Stefan: I was telling you about a time when I thought that everything was lost. When I had given up because that is exactly what you're doing right now.

Elena: That is not what...

Stefan: Yes, it is! Even if you don't want to admit it. You are giving up...and Lexi? She wouldn't let me give up. I'm not gonna let you.

 Woods 1864 

[Stefan and Lexi walk through the camp filled with injured and dead soldiers.]

Lexi: All of these men are dead or dying. What does that make you feel?

Stefan: Nothing. I feel nothing.

Lexi: Because you shut out the part of you that was human. The part that lets you feel.

Stefan: Is that not the point?

Lexi: Well, there is a better way. You simply have to want it.

Stefan: Is it better?

Lexi: Not at first. You can't choose what you feel. You have to let it all back in. The pain and the look in their eyes when you took their life. The cries of their loved ones.

Stefan: Why would I want to do that? Hmm?

Lexi: Because once you can hurt, you can love. Love, Stefan. That's the point. Everything is intensified when you're a vampire. When we hurt, we really hurt. But when we love...

[She smiles.]

 Gilbert Lake House 

Stefan: Lexi showed me that there was another way. And from that day forward, I started fighting for it. For my own survival.

[Stefan places his hand on Elena's cheek.]

Stefan: That's all I want you to do. I just want you to fight for it.

[He kisses her on the forehead and leans his forehead against hers for a second. He walks back into the house, leaving Elena standing outside.]

 Salvatore Boarding House 

[Alaric and Damon have moved Elijah's body down to the cellar.]

Alaric: You said there wasn't going to be any violence.

Damon: Says the guy that did all the killing.

[Damon starts to walk out, but Alaric grabs him.]

Alaric: Hey, I took the shot because I saw an opening, not because I planned to do this with Jenna in the house. Now, you can't lie to me like that.

[Damon tries to leave again, but Alaric grabs him.]

Alaric: Hey, I am your friend, damn it. And you don't have any friends. So, no more lying.

[Damon nods and leaves. Alaric looks down at Elijah's body, walks out, and closes the cell door behind him.]

 Gilbert Lake House 

[Elena is sitting on the couch, still reading Jon's journals. Stefan walks down the stairs and into the room.]

Stefan: Elijah's dead. Alaric did it.

[Stefan sits on the couch with Elena.]

Elena: Originals believed in truth and honor. It was forbidden for a vampire to kill another vampire. So, the dagger would take both lives. And as long as the dagger stays in place, the Original, for all intents and purposes, is dead.

[Stefan rushes to his phone and calls Damon.]

 Salvatore Boarding House 

[Damon rushes to the cellar and sees that Elijah has gone.]

 Martin Residence 

[Elijah opens the door. He has blood on his shirt.]

Jonas: What happened?

Elijah: I need you to find Elena. Now.

 Gilbert Residence 

[Bonnie is doing a spell. There are candles placed between her and Jeremy. She closes her eyes and candles go out. She opens her eyes and hands. The flames are now in her palms. She closes her hands and the candles are relit.]

Jeremy: Now that is cool. How does it work?

Bonnie: It's called channeling. Siphoning power from something...another witch...the Moon, an element.

Jeremy: So, technically, you could channel me.

Bonnie: What?

Jeremy: Well, I'm an element, sort of. I mean, isn't...isn't the human body mostly water?

Bonnie: You're right. Let's...see what happens.

[Bonnie and Jeremy move closer together. Bonnie places her hand on Jeremy's chest. They smile at each other. Suddenly, the door bursts open and Jonas walks in. Bonnie and Jeremy stand up.]

Jeremy: What the hell are you doing here?

[Jonas throws Jeremy against the wall with a wave of his hand.]

Bonnie: Jeremy!

[Jonas walks towards Bonnie.]

Jonas: What did my son tell you? What did he tell you?

Bonnie: He told me about your daughter. I know Klaus has her and I want to help you get her back. But I want us to work together. Please.

[He grabs her face.]

Jonas: This is for your own good.

[Jonas closes his eyes and start to chant a spell.]

Jonas:[Chants] Phasmatos Tribum, Exum Sue, Redem Su Pas Quo.

Bonnie: No! No. No!

[Bonnie tries to release herself from his grip, but cannot. He finally lowers Bonnie to the floor and releases her from his grip. Bonnie starts to cry.]

Jonas: If any harm comes to my son because of what you did, you will answer to me.

[Jonas walks out of the house and with a wave of his hand the door slams shut behind him. Jeremy falls down from the wall, having been released by Jonas, and he rushes over to Bonnie. He gently holds her.]

Jeremy: You okay? It's okay. What happened?

[He caresses her face in his hands as she looks up at him.]

Bonnie: He took my powers.

[Jeremy pulls her close to him and holds her.]

 Gilbert Lake House 

[Elijah walks up to the house. He kneels down and grabs some rocks. Elena starts to walk towards the front door, but Stefan grabs her by the arm. Elijah has gotten up outside and tosses the rocks from hand to hand. Stefan hears him.]

Stefan: He's here.

[Elijah throws the rocks at the door, breaking it off its hinges. Elena looks at Stefan.]

Elena: You have to go. I need to talk to him alone.

Stefan: Elena...

Elena: Stefan, I'm okay. He can't come in the house.

[Elijah walks closer towards the house.]

Elijah: You know, I might not be able to enter this house...But I'm a very patient man. I'll wait you out.

[Elena slowly walks out from behind the wall. Stefan stays hidden there. She walks towards the front door but stays inside the house.]

Elena: They shouldn't have done what they did.

Elijah: The deal is off.

Elena: I'm renegotiating.

Elijah: You have nothing left to negotiate with.

[There is a moment's silence. Then, Elena pulls out a knife. Elijah looks amused.]

Elena: I'd like to see you lure Klaus into Mystic Falls after the doppelgänger bleeds to death.

Elijah: Stefan won't let you die.

Elena: No, he won't. He'll feed me his blood to heal me, and then I'll kill myself and become a vampire, just like Katherine did. So unless you want that to happen again, promise me the same as before...promise me...You won't harm anyone that I love. Even if they've harmed you.

Elijah: I'm sorry, Elena. I'm going to have to call your bluff.

[Elena breathes out and points the knife to her stomach. Elijah watches her, unsure of what she will do. Elena looks up at him and stabs herself in the stomach. She screams in pain and falls to the floor. There is blood gushing everywhere. Elijah rushes towards the door, but stops at the threshold because he has not been invited in. Elena drops the knife on the floor and clutches her stomach.]

Elijah: No! Yes. Yes, you can have your deal. Let me heal you.

Elena: Give me your word!

Elijah: I give you my word.

[Elena limps outside and into Elijah's arms. Suddenly, she stabs Elijah with the silver dagger and Elijah falls to the ground, dead. Elena falls to the ground as well, weak from the blood loss. Stefan rushes out of the house, bites his wrist, and feeds Elena his blood. He places his chin on the top of her head. Damon walks out and stands in the doorway. Stefan cradles Elena's face in his hands and they both look at Damon.]

Damon: Little tip. Don't pull the dagger out.

 Gilbert Residence 

[Alaric walks into the kitchen. Jenna is in there getting a bottle of water.]

Alaric: Where did John disappear to?

Jenna: Maybe the same place the rest of the dinner party ran off to.

Alaric: Look, Jenna, I'm, uh...I'm so sorry tonight was...

Jenna: What happened to Isobel?

Alaric: You know, John should have never brought that up.

Jenna: That's not an answer.

Alaric: He's just trying to stir up trouble.

Jenna: That's not an answer, either.

Alaric: I can't talk about this, Jenna.

Jenna: I keep thinking that maybe it's me. Maybe I'm reading into things. I should trust you. That's what a relationship is about, right? But then I think that maybe John is right and maybe you're not being honest with me. So...are you being honest?

[Alaric purses his lips together and doesn't respond. Tears start to fall from Jenna's eyes.]

Jenna: Right, okay. Well, that was an answer.

[She walks out of the kitchen. John enters behind Alaric.]

John: Well, that was awkward.

[Alaric looks angry. He turns around and looks at John.]

John: You know, I can clear all this stuff up about Isobel tomorrow, if you want. Or not.

[Alaric takes the ring off his finger and places it on the table.]

Alaric: You want it? Take it. It's yours. And after what you did to Damon...

[Alaric smirks.]

Alaric: You're gonna need it more than me.

[Alaric walks out of the room.]

 Salvatore Boarding House 

[Damon and Stefan carry Elijah's body down into the cellar. Elena is with them. Stefan wraps his arm around her. Damon kneels down and searches through Elijah's jacket.]

Damon: Uhh! What do we have here?

[He pulls out the moonstone.]

Damon: A little moonstone bar of soap. I'll hold on to this.

Elena: So, that's it. I mean, as long as we keep the dagger in there, then he stays dead.

Damon: Pretty much.

Elena: Okay, then...Good night.

[Elena starts to walk out, but turns around. Damon and Stefan look at her.]

Elena: You know, you guys want me to fight, fine, I'll fight. But if we're gonna do this, you can't keep anything from me anymore. From this moment on, we're doing it my way.

Damon: That seems fair.

[She looks at Stefan.]

Stefan: Okay.

Elena: Okay.

[She walks out of the basement. Stefan and Damon look at each other.]

Damon: Seems like she's had a change of attitude. How did you get through to her?

Stefan: I told her a little story about when I was making the wrong decisions and somebody showed me there was a better way.

Damon: Lexi?

Stefan: Yeah. You remember her?

[Stefan walks out of the room.]

 Salvatore Boarding House 1864 

[Damon walks down the stairs and heads for the front door. Lexi walks in and stops him.]

Lexi: Going somewhere?

Damon: You must be the vampire I hear my brother complaining about.

Lexi: That would be me. And you must be the brother who hates him.

[She walks closer towards him. He puts his suitcase down.]

Damon: We are at irreparable odds.

Lexi: You know the hate you're feeling towards Stefan? Towards everyone? You think you have it under control but you don't. It will get the best of you.

[He picks his suitcase back up.]

Damon: Help him. He needs it.

Lexi: I'll help him.

[He opens the front door and walks out.]

 Salvatore Boarding House 

[Damon enters his bedroom and hears the shower running.]

Damon: Andie? I thought you left.

[He walks into the bathroom. Katherine is in the shower, she walks out and stands in front of Damon, completely naked. Damon looks at her, surprised.]

Katherine: Hello, Damon. Hey, do you have a robe?

Damon: How did you get out?

Katherine: I knew that if I begged you not to kill Elijah, that's exactly what you'd do. Little known fact...Originals can compel vampires. But as soon as they die, the compulsion wears off.

Damon: And you knew.

Katherine: And I'm still here. I didn't run. I meant what I said, Damon. I'm going to help you.

[Katherine looks down at her naked body.]

Katherine: So...How about that robe?
