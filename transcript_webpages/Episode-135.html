<p><i>[Caroline, who is working as a producer for KQBC Channel 3 News in Dallas, is rushing around the stage while she gets everything organized for broadcast]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Okay, people. We go live in thirty, so I need that media package done fifteen minutes ago. Where are my graphics and b-roll?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline has a tablet in her hands and is checking a list, but stops momentarily when she sees a male employee passing her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Jamie, we're good on music, right?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JAMIE: Yeah.
</dd></dl>

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TONY: <i>[sheepishly]</i> ...That's why he didn't ask to talk to you. Um, he's being sneaky.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: But, your paycheck comes from <i>me</i>, and you know how much I hate surprises. <i>Spill</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TONY: He's curious what your schedule is right before the wedding.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[confused]</i> Why?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TONY: I think he wants to plan a trip to Mystic Falls.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[worriedly]</i> But he knows that we can't go back there.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Tony gives her a confused look, which causes Caroline to realize that she's said too much. She smiles fakely to cover up her concern]</i>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="PRESENT_DAY--_MYSTIC_FALLS_BORDER.2C_2013"> PRESENT DAY-- MYSTIC FALLS BORDER, 2013 </span></h2>
<p><i>[Two college students, Amanda and Ryan, are standing outside the closed-off border of Mystic Falls and are filming themselves on a handheld video camera. There's a sign on the plastic fence that has been set up that reads "NO TRESPASSING. VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMANDA: Are both cameras on?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RYAN: First one's on, and second one is rolling.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The two crawl under the fence and into Mystic Falls, where they end up right in the cemetery. The young woman giggles as the man turns the camera so it's facing him to discuss what they're doing]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RYAN: So, a few weeks ago, the town of Mystic Falls was completely evacuated. The story is that some natural gas leak made it all uninhabitable, but there's been so many rumors, whispers, and just strange things happening in the night, unexplainable things.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> AMANDA: <i>[sarcastically]</i> Okay, tone it down, Blair Witch.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The man turns the camera back onto the woman]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RYAN: Let's see. What'd you bring me, huh?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The woman starts pulling different devices out of her backpack]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMANDA: Full spectrum light, EMF reader, and a thermal camera, courtesy of Uncle Fred's graduation fund.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The man turns on the thermal camera and starts recording her. She shows up on the screen as a bright yellow/orange/red light]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RYAN: <i>[jokingly]</i> Look how hot you are.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> AMANDA: <i>[rolls her eyes]</i> You're hilarious.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She holds up the EMF reader and starts waving it around]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMANDA: Okay, so this thing's supposed to beep if there's some spirit or something supernatural present.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RYAN: <i>[skeptically]</i> You get this thing off an infomercial or something?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[They start walking toward a mausoleum, and once they get closer, it is revealed that they're almost at the Salvatore crypt, where Elena's body has been placed inside with a strong protection spell keeping anyone from being able to enter. As they get closer, the EMF reader starts to beep]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMANDA: Wait, it's working!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RYAN: Whoa! It's creepy, but kind of awesome.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The two approach the crypt, the EMF reader still beeping all the while, and Ryan attempts to open it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RYAN: It won't open. No lock. It's just <i>stuck</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[They walk around to the window, where they find a window and look inside]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RYAN: It looks like there's a coffin in there or something.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He turns the camera back on Amanda, who is trying to fix her EMF reader, which has gone silent]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RYAN: Amanda...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> AMANDA: It's not working.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Ryan holds up the thermal camera and points it at her, and is stunned to see two people standing behind her and staring at the back of her head, causing him to gasp]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RYAN: Amanda!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> AMANDA: What?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RYAN: <i>[panicked]</i> There's something behind you!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> AMANDA: <i>[suspiciously]</i> Are you really trying to scare me?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She turns around, but when they both look back, they don't see anything. Suddenly, Amanda is yanked upward and into a tree by an invisible force]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMANDA: AHHHH!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RYAN: Amanda? Amanda!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, Amanda is suspended in the air, as though someone is holding onto her ankle. A female voice is heard laughing before Amanda is dropped onto the ground, wheezing loudly. The thermal camera picks up the warmth of her blood, which is covering the side of one of the tombs. Ryan rushes over to Amanda, and when he sees the wound on her neck, he immediately starts to apply pressure to it with her hand]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RYAN: It's okay. I'll get help, okay? I'll be back. I--
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Before Ryan can finish, someone yanks him backward out of the line of sight of the camera. Screaming and slurping sounds are heard until someone else picks up the camera and holds it up to reveal that Mary Louise had attacked him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[laughs]</i> Much better than those blood bags!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Ryan, still alive, screams in fear as he tries to pull himself away from them, but Mary Louise just glares at him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: No screaming, please!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise has picked up the video camera and points it at Nora, who has the other video camera in her hands and is pointing it back at her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: How do you know how to work that device?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora flips the screen and points the camera at herself]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: I don't, but if these two could, I'm sure it's idiot-proof.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, a light is shined on the two girls just as the sound of a gun being cocked is heard. Mary Louise looks up in surprise when she sees Matt in his police uniform, pointing a rifle at them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Let him go.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Mystic Falls is ours now. So is any human who steps foot inside it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: I said, let him go!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Ryan, scared, sits up and scoots back away from them. Nora, amused, drops the camera and waves her hand to the side, which causes Matt's rifle to be telekinetically ripped from his hands and impaled in Ryan's chest, killing him. She then walks over to Matt, who yelps in fear and raises his hands defensively in front of his face]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: AHHH!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The next morning, Matt awakens on the ground in the cemetery as the sun shines down on him. He's confused and blurry-eyed at first until he starts to remember the events of the previous night. When he looks down at his hands, he finds that his right wrist has been cut and bandaged with a tied handkerchief. He sits up in horror and groans, knowing this can't mean anything good]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WHITMORE_COLLEGE"> WHITMORE COLLEGE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Alaric is standing in front of his Occult Studies class at Whitmore and beginning his lecture for the day. Every desk in the room has someone seated in it, including Bonnie, who seems both amused and depressed by Alaric's choice of lecture topics for the day]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: I want to talk about death. More specifically, I want to talk about what happens after.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He takes a lot around at the over-full classroom and chuckles]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Now, I'm not going to pretend like my good looks are the reason this class is so full.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The students all laugh]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: I've heard the same stories you have about Mystic Falls. Ghost sightings, poltergeists...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[A male student calls out to him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STUDENT: Zombies!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric and the students laugh]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Now, let's talk about it. What's behind all of these stories? Now, almost every culture has the lore of a creature or being that cheats death. Why do our brains insist on inventing the most unbelievable things?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie, seated in the middle of the room, seems slightly worried about Alaric as he continues his lecture]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: It's because the reality of death is actually the most unbelievable thing of all. Now, the most terrifying thing that you're going to encounter in Mystic Falls is a trespassing ticket, okay? So, everyone just <i>stay out</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[After class has been dismissed, Bonnie walks up to the front of the lecture hall to talk to Alaric]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: So, the Great Mystic Falls Evacuation Plan isn't going as well as everyone hoped...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[chuckles]</i> Heh. Well, they turned it into a ghost town. That part worked. Unfortunately for us, ghost towns are like amusement parks for college kids. The Heretics have killed <i>ten people</i> already. Two last night-- idiots looking for a ghost selfie.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie looks at him with concern]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Are you okay?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric sighs, and Bonnie hesitates awkwardly before continuing]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: ...Damon told me what you were doing in Europe.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[sheepishly]</i> Losing my money and my sanity to a series of con artists?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[smiles weakly]</i> Yeah.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Don't worry, I'm over it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[sympathetically]</i> It's okay if you're not, Ric. Heck, I'm a <i>little</i> offended you didn't come to me first!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[sarcastically]</i> What, you wouldn't think it's weird that I'm trying to contact my fiancée, who's been dead for <i>months</i>?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[shrugs]</i> Honestly, after everything we've experienced? It'd be weird if you <i>weren't</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She smiles at him and goes to leave, but Alaric, getting an idea, stops her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Hey, Bonnie? Have you ever heard of the Phoenix Stone?
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="MYSTIC_FALLS_SUBURBS"> MYSTIC FALLS SUBURBS </span></h2>
<p><i>[Stefan is driving down the abandoned streets of one of Mystic Falls' residential areas as he leaves Caroline a voicemail]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[on the phone]</i> Caroline... haven't heard from you. I'm starting to think that maybe you're just using me for random, hot make-out sessions... which I'm not <i>entirely</i> opposed to. But, uh, give me a call.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He hangs up the phone and puts it in his pocket, but when he looks back up at the road, he sees a man standing in the middle of the road and slams the brakes to avoid running him over. It's Beau, who is glaring at him. Stefan parks the car and gets out to see what he wants]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[confused]</i> Can I help you...?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Beau, as usual, remains silent, and after a moment, Stefan rolls his eyes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: It's okay. I speak mute. Just communicate what you want with a series of grunts...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Beau, unamused, casts a spell that creates a high-frequency noise that causes Stefan to fall to his knees and clutch his head in pain]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: AHHH!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[After a moment, Lily appears behind him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: You'll have to excuse Beau-- he's not in the mood for glib jokes. None of us are, actually.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily looks at Beau, who reluctantly releases Stefan from the effects of the spell. They both continue to glare at Stefan as he gets back on his feet]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: I thought we had a deal.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[annoyed]</i> Yeah, we do. Otherwise, I would be at home, not out patrolling the streets to keep humans out of your minions' fangs.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[bitterly]</i> We found Malcolm in the town square last night, his heart removed.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan's eyes widen in surprise, which leads Lily to realize he wasn't involved]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: You didn't know.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: No, I didn't, because we didn't <i>do</i> it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[sighs]</i> I'm not here to blame you, Stefan. I came so you'd understand why we did what you had to do.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[growls]</i> What did you do?
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SALVATORE_BOARDING_HOUSE"> SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Caroline has awakened in the boarding house cellar to find that she's in a wooden chair, where Enzo, wearing thick gloves, is binding her wrists and ankles to the arms and legs of the chair with vervain-soaked ropes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Sorry, love. It will only hurt for a second.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He grabs another soaked rope from the bucket and wraps it around her wrists, and Caroline groans in pain]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: What the hell is wrong with you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Someone killed Malcolm. Lily need to retaliate.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Strange. You don't look like Lily.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[sarcastically]</i> Yeah, well, it's all in the lighting, darling. Look, be happy I'm the one who grabbed you. I don't want to think what would happen if the others did. I am the closest thing you have as a friend in here.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Well fun tip, friends don't really like being tied up with vervain ropes!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Hush now, deep breath.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo finishes tying her up, and she hisses as it burns her skin]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: There you are.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo turns to leave, and Caroline, panting for breath, calls out after him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Enzo, please! This hurts really, really bad.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline's eyes are full of tears, and she bites her lips from pain. Despite his actions, it's clear he feels bad, and after a moment, he turns back toward her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Oh God, I hate whiners.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo kneels down and loosens the ropes that connect her wrists and keep them bound to the arms. Caroline's panting stops, and she starts to scowl at him, causing Enzo to realize she tricked him, though not quickly enough to stop her. Breaks out of her restraints and uses the vervain rope to choke Enzo before head-butting him so hard he falls onto the floor. Once he's down, she quickly flips backward, breaking the wooden chair into pieces. She quickly hops to her feet, grabbing one of the broken chair legs to use as a makeshift stake]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[mockingly]</i> Now... deep breath!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She stabs him in the thigh with the stake and vamp-speeds upstairs. However, before she can reach the door, she is blocked by Mary Louise]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Leaving so soon?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline grimaces and turns to vamp-speed in the opposite direction, only to be blocked by Nora]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: I'm wearing your jacket! Though, it's a little large on me...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Enzo appears in the doorway, looking annoyed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: It's all right, you two. I've got her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Do you? Because it certainly doesn't look like it. What's that expression? "Finders keepers?"
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise mouths an unintelligible spell and flicks her wrist, which magically causes Caroline to be knocked unconscious and fall onto the floor. Mary Louise and Nora smirk at each other in satisfaction while Enzo just looks frustrated]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="LOCKWOOD_MANSION"> LOCKWOOD MANSION </span></h2>
<p><i>[Damon and Stefan have just walked into the Lockwood Mansion together. Damon is carrying a bag full of his things, which he dumps onto the nearby couch in the living room]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[smirks] </i>Just so we're clear, I'm taking the master bedroom. Carol Lockwood and I had a little thing. I think she'd want me to have it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon stops and takes a look around the room before wrinkling his nose]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Let's open some windows, too. It reeks of dog in here. Which is impressive, considering Tyler's been with Jeremy for months.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan finally joins him in the living room and shoots him an angry glare]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You killed him, didn't you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Tyler? No. Jeremy? Once. But are we really bringing that up right now?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[unamused]</i> The Heretic, Malcolm. Lily came by earlier. She found him in the town square without a heart.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Oh, did she want that back? I mean, I think I packed it somewhere, alright?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[coldly]</i> You know, Lily and I had a deal.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> A <i>bad</i> deal.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: She took Caroline.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[stunned]</i> What?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: To retaliate for breaking our "bad deal," she took Caroline.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[horrified]</i> But you weren't the one that did it...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Yeah, I know I wasn't. <i>You</i> were. Which is why you are gonna go over there, and you're gonna fix it.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SALVATORE_BOARDING_HOUSE_2"> SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE </span></h2>

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hello, Mother.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[coldly]</i> May I help you?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon looks over her shoulder and notices an unfamiliar woman vacuuming the foyer]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Couple things-- A) Who the hell is that?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily turns around to glance at the woman before facing Damon again]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Who, Lucy? She's the kind woman I've hired to clean up this house that you let fall into disrepair.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily raises her voice to talk to Lucy, but doesn't take her eyes off of Damon]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Oh, Lucy, darling, could you come clean the welcome mat, please? This man was just leaving.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[exasperated]</i> B) No, I'm not.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[unamused]</i> Excuse me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I think there's been a bit of a mix-up. See, last night, I was in the town square, minding my own business, when I tripped and accidentally ripped Malcolm's heart out.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[rolls her eyes]</i> Deflecting. Of course. You never could admit when you were wrong.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She goes to close the door, but Damon stops her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Okay, wait-- I admit it. I killed him. I killed him in cold blood, just like that. Stef and Caroline had nothing to do with it, so if you'll just kindly let her go...
</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> BONNIE: It's pretty brilliant, really. They drain the vervain from your blood, compel you to sign the deed, compel you not to let Stefan and Damon in, and compel you to forget any of it ever happened. And bingo, the house is an impenetrable fortress, and vampires can't rescue Caroline.

Once he's done, he picks up two stones-- the Phoenix Stone and a regular rock-- and hesitantly drops the rock into the acid to test it. The acid immediately starts disintegrating the rock until it turns into foam, and Alaric seems both surprised and disappointed]</i>

<p><i>[Bonnie is keeping an eye on both the timer on her phone and on the technically-dead Matt on the porch of the house, and after a moment, she puts her hands on his chest in order to restart his heart. However, before she can begin to chant the incantation, she gasps deeply as she's overcome by visions very similar to the ones when she touched the Phoenix Stone earlier. She sees flashes of a man with a bloody mouth and face who is screaming in agony as he applies pressure to a wound. As he screams and writhes around, a cross-shaped wound is bleeding on his chest, much like the one Beau has on his neck and Stefan had on his chest in the flash-forward from the <a href="/wiki/Day_One_of_Twenty-Two_Thousand,_Give_or_Take/Transcript" title="Day One of Twenty-Two Thousand, Give or Take/Transcript">previous episode</a>.

<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[unamused]</i> You'll have to excuse me for not responding to that particular endearment. May I help you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Actually, you can. I don't know if you know this, but last night, Lily kidnapped Caroline-- not very cool. So, I know we've had our issues, but I also know that you're not like Lily's Crazy-tics, so I was thinking-- help me get her back?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: That would be foolish of me, considering <i>I'm</i> the one who kidnapped her.

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Wow. You know, I never thought I'd see the day when you'd choose to be Lily's errand-boy over us, but...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[coldly]</i> I chose you and your friends <i>many times.</i> Many times, you and your friends chose each other over me. Let's just say that Lily and I have similar views on loyalty.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[skeptically]</i> You know she abandoned her entire family once. Who's to say she won't do it again?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[annoyed]</i> She didn't abandon her <i>family</i>-- she abandoned her <i>relatives</i>. There's a difference.

<p><i>[Damon, frustrated, takes a step into the boarding house, which surprises Enzo]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yeah. One is a permanent blood tie, a name, a legacy.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Well, in her eyes, Malcolm was more a Salvatore than you ever were. Why else would she bury him in the family crypt next to Elena?

<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[smirks]</i> That crypt is sealed shut.

</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan processes all of this new information for a moment]</i>

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[confused]</i> How're you gonna do that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: There were four Heretics at the funeral. Dead Malcolm makes five. But, in 1903, there were six, which means there's one more. And I'm gonna find him, and I'm gonna negotiate a trade.

He looks back at the table before walking over to it and folding down the sheet over it, revealing the upper body of a young man who has just been sewn up following his autopsy. Alaric takes a deep breath and holds the stone over the man's chest, eventually setting it right over his heart and letting go of it. He stands back and waits a moment, and just when he's sure the stone doesn't actually work, the man's hands start to shake before he gasps, having been revived from his previously deceased state. He starts to gasp for breath, and Alaric, alarmed, yanks the stone off of him, which causes him to fall still again. He then looks around nervously to make sure no one saw him as he sighs]</i>
