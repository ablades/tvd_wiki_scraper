<p>[Atticus Shane is running through the woods. An unknown man with tribal paint on his face is pursuing him. Shane comes to a stop on a large pile of rocks and spots a cave entrance. Excited, he runs to the cave, then looks behind him to find that his pursuer is nowhere in sight. He enters the cave, turning on a flashlight. Looking around, he finds strange writings on the walls, then notices a large hole in the middle of the floor.]

<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: Two hundred miles off the Nova Scotia mainland. If you recall, the whole point was to hide the cure on the world's most obscure, desolate island.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">Damon</a></b>: Oh yeah? I thought the whole point was that no one found Silas, the oldest, deadliest freak in the world.

</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson" title="Rebekah Mikaelson">Rebekah</a></b>: Go ahead, try and kill me. But then you'd have to face your real problems. Like the fact that Stefan invited me here, himself. I guess he likes me again.
</dd></dl>
<p>[Rebekah walks off, Stefan offers to help Elena up, but she ignores him and walks away looking irritated. Elena shoves the white oak stake into her bag and Damon joins her.]

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Elena_Gilbert" title="Elena Gilbert">Elena</a></b>: You know, you're right. With any luck, I'll only have to tolerate her for a few more days, and then we'll find the cure and I'll never have to deal with her again.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">Damon</a></b>: Human Rebekah...I can't imagine her without fangs.

</dd></dl>
<p>[Bonnie smiles.]
</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Bonnie_Bennett" title="Bonnie Bennett">Bonnie</a></b>: These symbols must have been left for the hunters, so they can find the cure. And this must be the story of Qetsiyah and Silas. According to Shane, Silas asked Qetsiyah for help making a spell for immortality. She helped make him immortal, only to learn that he planned to use the same spell on another women, not her. When she found out, she freaked.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Gilbert" title="Jeremy Gilbert">Jeremy</a></b>: So, Qetsiyah killed the other woman?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Bonnie_Bennett" title="Bonnie Bennett">Bonnie</a></b>: Yeah. Silas was immortal. She couldn't kill him. So she trapped him in a cave, and buried him alive instead.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Gilbert" title="Jeremy Gilbert">Jeremy</a></b>: Does it say anything about the hunter's purpose in all this?
</dd></dl>
<p>[Shane comes up behind them.]
</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: I was wondering when you'd ask. Qetsiyah created a cure for immortality, and then she buried it with Silas, hoping that he'd take it and die, and end up on the other side with her for all eternity. But he wouldn't give her the satisfaction. So, many centuries later, her descendants created the hunters to find him, cure him and kill him. You know what? I'll explain on the hike. Come on. We gotta get going.
</dd></dl>
<p>[They all begin to hike through the woods.]

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson" title="Niklaus Mikaelson">Klaus</a></b>: Only until Bonnie's spell locking me in here wears off. Then I'll look different. Angrier, perhaps. Or I won't look like anything because I'll have gouged your eyeballs from their sockets.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Tyler_Lockwood" title="Tyler Lockwood">Tyler</a></b>: My friends will be back with the cure by then. So, I could shove it down your throat and make you mortal.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson" title="Niklaus Mikaelson">Klaus</a></b>: I'm an Original. What makes you think my entire vampire bloodline won't be cured along with me? I.e., you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Tyler_Lockwood" title="Tyler Lockwood">Tyler</a></b>: You know what I think? I think that's impossible. I think the moment you stop being a vampire, our whole blood connection to you is broken, and your sire-line ceases to exist. So, whatever happens to you, happens only to you, which means I can kill your ass and no one else has to die. Although I am still debating just how to do it.
</dd></dl>
<p>[Klaus vamps towards Tyler, but can't get him due to the barrier.]
</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson" title="Niklaus Mikaelson">Klaus</a></b>: I recommend drowning. There's nothing quite like the feeling of someone fighting for something as basic as human breath. And let me tell you, your mother was a fighter.

<p>[The group is still hiking. Shane gets out his phone but it beeps like it has no service.]
</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: Satellite phone lost its signal.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson" title="Rebekah Mikaelson">Rebekah</a></b>: I'm merely stating the facts. Jeremy has the spell on his body. Bonnie is the witch that unseals the cure. Shane is the human compass. You and I have the tombstone, which does god knows what. And Elena has no point.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">Damon</a></b>: What about me?

</p><p>[Hours later, it's night-time. The group is still hiking through the woods using flashlights. Shane is using a headlamp.]
</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: Centuries after Qetsiyah died, there were these miners who were excavating a well on the island. Suddenly went mad. They bled themselves dry. No apparent reason. So, the legend spread that these miners, in exchange for a drop of their blood, saw visions of their lost loved ones in the well they were digging. The word traveled and explorers sought out the well to see if the legend was true.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Bonnie_Bennett" title="Bonnie Bennett">Bonnie</a></b>: So, the well was magic?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: Well, you know, some people believe the voices of lost souls were just a wind vortex whipping through the caves, and visions were caused by inhaling the island's poisonous plant life.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Elena_Gilbert" title="Elena Gilbert">Elena</a></b>: And what do you believe?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: I believe in magic. My wife and my son died within months of each other. And so...I decided to try the well out for myself.
</dd></dl>
<p>[Cut to the flashback a year ago when Shane found the well. He uses a knife to cut his hand open and drip his blood down into the well.]
</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: [voiceover] I offered up my blood and I waited.
</dd></dl>
<p>[Shane continues to hold his bleeding hand over the well. Suddenly whispering voices echo around the cave, and Shane looks around.]
</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: Hello? Hello?

<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: Caitlin. Caitlin? Caitlin?
</dd></dl>
<p>[Shane begins to rappel down into the well with some climbing gear. He continues to hear indistinct whispers echoing around him. He starts to panic, loses his grip on his rope and falls down onto the well floor. He shouts in pain, grunting as he tries to catch his breath back. A woman is standing over him.]
</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Caitlin_Shane" title="Caitlin Shane">Caitlin</a></b>: Hello, Atty.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: Caitlin. [voiceover] I saw my wife. I saw her eyes, her smile. [back in present day] My blood let me see her again.

<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">Damon</a></b>: Yeah, got it. Don't eat the poisonous flowers. [He continues walking and the others follow.]

[He picks up a large rock] Our first lesson in survival. [He throws the rock and it triggers a net trap that swings up into the trees.] Stay together. Keep your eyes open.
</dd></dl>
<p>[Everyone continues walking again. Jeremy, the last in the group, stops.]
</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Gilbert" title="Jeremy Gilbert">Jeremy</a></b>: Ugh, I'm out of water.

</dd></dl>
<p>[Jeremy smiles sadly and takes a sip of his water while Elena turns and follows after the others. In the background a branch snaps and Jeremy turns to see a man with tribal paint on his face aiming an arrow at him.]
</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Elena_Gilbert" title="Elena Gilbert">Elena</a></b>: Jeremy!
</dd></dl>
<p>[She vamp-speeds over to push him out of the way and the arrow misses. The man reloads his bow but suddenly he grunts and falls to the ground, a hatchet in his back. Elena runs back over to look at their downed attacker.]
</p>

<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Gilbert" title="Jeremy Gilbert">Jeremy</a></b>: [rejoining her] Somebody just saved my life.

<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Stefan_Salvatore" title="Stefan Salvatore">Stefan</a></b>: What is this place?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: According to island lore, a group of college kids came here for spring break. A few weeks later, they were all found dead, completely drained of blood.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson" title="Rebekah Mikaelson">Rebekah</a></b>: Well, tragic for them, brilliant for us. Who sleeps where?
</dd></dl>
<p>[The rest start to settle around the site while Damon talks to Shane.]
</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">Damon</a></b>: Well, that's lovely. There's a mystery man with a hatchet lurking in the woods and we're just gonna camp?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: We're safer here than we are hiking in the dark.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">Damon</a></b>: Let's just keep going. You know? Get the cure. Get in, get out. Where is it?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: How stupid do you think I am?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">Damon</a></b>: Stupid enough to raise an immortal witch, so I'd say...incredibly.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Atticus_Shane" title="Atticus Shane">Prof. Shane</a></b>: You know, I'm shocked you even want the cure, considering you've got the most to lose once Elena's human.
</dd></dl>

</p>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Elena_Gilbert" title="Elena Gilbert">Elena</a></b>: Shane doesn't know what he's talking about.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">Damon</a></b>: Yeah, well we'll find out tomorrow.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Elena_Gilbert" title="Elena Gilbert">Elena</a></b>: Do you really think that I'm gonna take this cure, break the sire bond, and fall out of love with you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">Damon</a></b>: No. I'm saying we don't know. And if we find it tomorrow, we will.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Elena_Gilbert" title="Elena Gilbert">Elena</a></b>: This cure is gonna change so many things. Jeremy's not gonna want to kill me anymore. We're finally gonna get rid of Klaus. Bonnie's mom isn't gonna be a vampire. And anyone who wants to take this cure is gonna have that option. Caroline, Stefan, you. If you want it. [she smiles at him expectantly.]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">Damon</a></b>: No, I get it. Everything changes tomorrow. It'll be all unicorns and rainbows.

Torture gives you a sense of control, especially with your relevance slipping away. [Damon calmly breaks a metal rod in half] And look at you. Here you are, hours from Elena breaking her sire bond. You're starting to freak out a little bit. Listen, you want my advice? Leave. Go. Don't put yourself through this. [Damon whacks Shane with the halves of the metal rod] Agh! Fine. Okay. Let's say her feelings for you are real. How does that end? She's human. You're a vampire. [Damon strikes him across the face with the rod; Shane groans in pain.] It's doomed, Damon. See, you're not torturing me, man. You're torturing yourself by helping them find the cure.
</dd></dl>
