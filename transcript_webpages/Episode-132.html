<p>(Bonnie is breathing heavily and turns around in bed, she wakes up and sees a woman standing over her bed.)
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Elena?
</dd></dl>
<p>(She stands up and looks around her, as though somebody else is in the room. She walks towards the fireplace and grabs a poker, only to turn around and see Lilly.)
</p>
<dl><dd> LILLY: Hello again, Bonnie.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Lilly... I thought Stefan locked you in the cellar.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Lilly: He did, but prisons are easily escaped-- you of all people should know that.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: (worried) What do you want?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILLY: Must I constantly repeat myself? If you don't know what I want by now...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: You want your creepy witch-vampire family back. Well, at the risk of repeating myself, there's <i>no</i> way.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILLY: Isn't there? What's that term you witches are so fond of? "Loophole?"
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Hmm. Even if there is a loophole, I won't help you find it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILLY: Oh, you've made your position quite clear. Apparently I failed to do the same, because you seem to think that I'm here for your help. (She vamps out) I'm not.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: (raises her hand to do a spell) <i>Phesmatos incendia</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Nothing happens, and Bonnie looks concerned)
</p>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Lillian_Salvatore" title="Lillian Salvatore">LILLY</a>: (chuckles) Hmm. Those are lovely words, Bonnie. Here's another one... <i>die</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Lilly vamp-speeds to her but Bonnie stabs her in the stomach with the poker. Lilly gasps and Bonnie runs away. Bonnie runs out the door and looks back one more time, but when she turns back around, she runs straight into Kai.)
</p>
<dl><dd> KAI: Wow, you are <i>not</i> good at running.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>Motus</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Once again, nothing happens. Bonnie looks alarmed, but Kai just laughs in amusement)
</p>
<dl><dd> KAI: No magic? Oh, that's my fault, I was spooning you earlier. I think I might've sleep-siphoned you. Oh, but keep trying. It's adorable, like you're having a little seizure.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: (confused) --How are you...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KAI: (cuts her off) --Did you think you could keep screwing people over and there wouldn't be any consequences?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILLY: Now...
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie quickly turns around to find Lilly standing behind her. Lilly vamps-out)
</p>
<dl><dd> LILLY: Where were we?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Before she gets a chance to bite her, Bonnie is waken up by Elena, who is pulling the blanket off her)
</p>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Up, up, up. Come on, no time to sleep in. (She offers her hands to help Bonnie up) We have to get Jo.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Get <i>Jo</i>?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Yeah.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Is everything okay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: I hope so, considering she's walking down the aisle in t-minus ten hours. Come on (She claps her hands) Wedding bells await!
</dd></dl>
<p>(The wedding dress is shown and Jo looks worried.)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SALVATORE_BOARDING_HOUSE"> SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE </span></h2>
<p>(Jo, Elena, and Bonnie are preparing for the wedding in one of the studies in the boarding house. Jo is rushing around the room as she searches for something)
</p>
<dl><dd> JO: Crap, they're not here.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena looks up at her as she fills a glass with champagne)
</p>
<dl><dd> ELENA: What's wrong?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: (freaks out) My shoes! My gorgeous, ridiculously expensive, wear-them-once-and-then-never-again <i>shoes</i>. They are missing.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Do you want me to do a locator spell?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: (confused) On my shoes?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Mm-hmmm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: Is that possible?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I don't know, actually. Just hang on, I got to figure out how to work this stupid thing.
</dd></dl>
<p>(She is helplessly trying to get a garment steamer to turn on, and accidentally pulls the hose out. Jo looks alarmed and frustrated as she sighs)
</p>
<dl><dd> JO: (sarcastically) Oh, good, break it! Because my wrinkled dress will surely distract everyone from my bare feet.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena turns to calm Jo down)
</p>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Hey, hey. Come on. Don't waste all your panic now! You still have eight hours until the ceremony. (She offers her a glass) Non-alcoholic mimosa?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: (stressed) <i>One</i>, a non-alcoholic mimosa is just an orange juice. And <i>two</i>, I can't drink. Somebody should drink. You should drink.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (smiles) I will drink, eventually. But, I have <i>human</i> tolerance now, which is cheaper but a lot less fun. (Elena and Jo clink their glasses together) Cheers.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Jo's cell phone suddenly rings, and Elena lunges for it to answer it for her)
</p>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Oh. oh! (to Jo) Relax. (She answers the call) Jo's phone. Oh, huh. Okay.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: (panicked) That's not an "okay" okay. That's a "there's a problem" okay.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (on the phone) Yeah, we'll call you back. Bye. (She hangs up the phone and awkwardly hesitates for a moment before she turns to Jo) Danielle's got the flu.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: (smiles tightly) Huh. It sounded like you just said, "Danielle has the flu," which is impossible, because Danielle is my wedding coordinator.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (grimaces) ...Yeah.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: (frantically) Well, how sick is she? Can she still work?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: ...It depends on how much vomit you want to have at the wedding.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Jo walks away and starts to pace around the room, but she stops when she hears a voice.)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: To be honest, I think maybe this is a good thing! Because no matter how good Danielle was, I am pretty sure I'm better.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena smiles and rushes over to hug her)
</p>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Caroline, I missed you!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: I missed me, too.
</dd></dl>
<p>(They pull away)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Thank you for getting me back.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena nods happily)
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: (emotionally) Hi!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Hi!
</dd></dl>
<p>(She hugs Bonnie, both of them with tears in their eyes, but they pull away after a moment)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Okay, now, we've got a lot to do and not a lot time to do it. Elena, just have a drink, you're not going to pass out. (Elena goes to fix herself a drink) Bonnie, the switch is on the left-hand side on the back.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Oh!
</dd></dl>
<p>(She walks to the steamer so she can finish steaming the wrinkles out of Jo's wedding gown)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: And Jo, I can see your shoes under the couch. (She winks at Jo, who sighs in relief) Okay, now, who's dealing with the boys?
</dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ALARIC.27S_APARTMENT"> ALARIC'S APARTMENT </span></h2>
<p>(Matt, Tyler, and Alaric are hanging out at Alaric's apartment before they get ready for the wedding. They all sit down around Alaric's coffee table, which holds a bottle of bourbon and shot glasses)
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Okay, we got suits.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: (opens the ring boxes) I got the rings!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: And the vows.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: So... What do we do now?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Tyler begins filling the shot glasses with bourbon. Once he's finished, he holds up a shot glass in a toast)
</p>
<dl><dd> TYLER: To Alaric Saltzman, who after today, will have sex with <i>only</i> one woman for the rest of his life
</dd></dl>
<p>(He hands Alaric a shot glass, and they all laugh)
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Seriously, just one! You can't even <i>look</i> after this.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: Not that chicks are throwing themselves at an occult studies professor, but...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: (laughs) Yeah! Actually, you should probably lock this down while you still can.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Yeah, you remember how great it was when you two were fighting?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: (shrugs) Sorry, full moon tonight. Feeling extra dick-ish.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: (to Matt) And what's your excuse?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Both Matt and Tyler's cell phones buzz at the same time, indicating they've just received text messages. They reach for their phones at the same time and check their messages, causing Alaric to become concerned)
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: What? What is it?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: (sighs) Wedding day chores.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT &amp; TYLER: (simultaneously) Courtesy of Caroline.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: (laughs) Karma. Sweet, sweet karma.
</dd></dl>
<p>(They all clink their glasses and drink their shots)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SALVATORE_BOARDING_HOUSE_2"> SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE </span></h2>
<p>(Elena is doing her make-up in Damon's bedroom, Caroline walks in to join her while she looks at her phone.)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Okay, the boys are officially taken care of, bride and maid of honor are in hair and make-up. I'm gonna head to the venue and fix... whatever they're screwing up.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena is reaching for something and almost burns her hand on the curling iron that is sitting next to the sink. Caroline instantly panics and rushes to stop her)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: (worried) Elena, the curling iron!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (gives her a look) Yes, I can see it, Care.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: (sheepishly) Okay!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: I'm human now, not blind. And I'm not fragile, either. You don't have to walk on eggshells around me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Uh, I do, actually. Because if you walked on them, they could cut you and you'd get infected and <i>probably</i> die.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (considers this statement) You know what? Given my luck, that actually seems possible.
</dd></dl>
<p>(They both giggle, Elena grabs a glass of champagne.)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: So, what's it like now in the world of the living?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: It's different, I'm slower, I have to look both ways before crossing the street, but it's nice to not...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: (blurts out) --Be a monster like me, who turns off their humanity and commits murder instead of dealing with grief like a normal person?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (looks at her sympathetically) I was gonna say... not have to wear a daylight ring all the time.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Caroline chuckles in embarrassment)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Look, I'm so sorry, Elena. I was trying to hurt you when I said that you would never truly be happy with Damon because you weren't human. And now you are, and I just hope that it's not because I made you think that you would be miserable for eternity.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena walks toward her and touches Caroline's arm comfortingly)
</p>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Care, I've wanted to be human from the day I became a vampire. Besides, I'm the last person that you need to apologize to.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Thanks, I kind of wanted to start with an easy one.
</dd></dl>
<p>(She laughs awkwardly, and Elena nods in understanding)
</p>
<dl><dd> ELENA: The dreaded "Amends Tour."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Mmm, if you see Stefan, by the way, I am <i>avoiding</i>. (She looks at herself in the mirror.) I just need to get my life in order first. Starting with my friends.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Stefan's not a friend?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Stefan's... complicated. I just figured I'd work my way up to that one.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Well, you're in the clear. He's got his hands full with Damon today.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: What's wrong with Damon?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Not much... (She hesitates before continuing on, trying hard to seem casual) He just said he would take the cure with me...
</dd></dl>
<p>(Upon hearing this, Caroline immediately turns to Elena and looks shocked.)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Damon Salvatore? <i>Human</i>? I... I can't even picture it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (sadly) Yeah. Something tells me neither can he.
</dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="VIRGINIA_SUBURBS"> VIRGINIA SUBURBS </span></h2>
<p>(Damon and Stefan are in Stefan's car, where Stefan is driving them to an unknown place. While they drive, Damon mocks Stefan for his timing)
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: (mockingly) "Sure. I'll be your best man, Ric. But first, hang out with the <i>worst</i> man so that my brother can kidnap me on the day of your wedding."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: (slightly offended) Hey, don't you hate weddings anyway?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I hate little Stefan mind-games even more.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hmm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: So, anytime you want to clue me in as to where the hell we're going...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Oh, come on. It's your last few days as a vampire. Can't blame me for wanting to spend some quality time with my brother. Ah, look, here we are.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan parks the car in front of a brown house, and they get out and look at it.)
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: (sarcastically) Is Mr. Rogers expecting us?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You know Mr. Rogers is dead, right?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yeah, you're gonna be joining him in make-believe if you don't get to the damn point.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: So, this is a house I lived in during one of my many attempts to start over. Welcome to your suburban nightmare.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You don't think I thought this through?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Well, I think you've thought about a life with Elena. I don't think you've thought about neighbors or a mortgage or-- (A boy who is playing in the yard next door accidentally kicks a ball at Damon)-- or <i>kids</i>. I don't know, might not be your thing.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan walks away, and Damon throws the ball back to the boy.)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SALVATORE_BOARDING_HOUSE_3"> SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE </span></h2>
<p>(Someone knocks at the door of the Salvatore house. When Bonnie opens it, she finds Enzo on the front step, smiling at her, and immediately tries to close it, but Enzo holds it open)
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Relax, relax. I'm not here to cause mischief.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Said everyone who <i>ever</i> causes mischief.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: I told Lilly I'd visit.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Is this like some Oedipus thing? All right, you know what? Doesn't matter.
</dd></dl>
<p>(She once again tries to close the door, but Enzo is faster and stops her.)
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Excuse me, little witch.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: If you think, I'm gonna let you-- a ruiner-- in here to see another ruiner on the day of Jo's wedding, you got another thing coming.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: She's lonely, and <i>hungry</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p>(He holds up his hand, revealing that he's holding an iPod with earbuds wrapped around it)
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: And she can't eat that.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: I'm not trying to feed her. I'm trying to keep her sane. (He throws the iPod at Bonnie) That is filled with loads of songs from the last era she knew. I thought it might bring her comfort. If you're not a complete monster, I trust you'll pass it on.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Enzo walks away, leaving Bonnie conflicted about what to do. She closes the door and goes to the basement, but stops when she hears Lilly babbling to herself quietly.)
</p>
<dl><dd> LILLY: I want my family back. That's all I've ever wanted, to have my family back, with <i>me</i>, where they belong.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie walks to the door of the cellar and looks in through the bars, but she can't see Lily inside anywhere)
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: (confused) What?
</dd></dl>
<p>(When she wants to walk away Lilly appears, having hidden next to the door out of sight. She grabs Bonnie by the throat and tries to strangle her, but Bonnie escapes out of her hold. They look at each other with anger until Bonnie gets scared and runs away.)
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>(Upstairs in the parlor, Elena is using makeup to conceal the bruises on Bonnie's neck from where Lilly tried to choke her to death)
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: She was rambling on about her family, and then I got close to her, and she <i>attacked</i> me, like an animal.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (sighs) Sounds like she's reached the full-blown crazy stage of drying out.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: You're saying this is all because she's drying out?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: It's hard for me to explain how awful it is but, yeah. Your mind starts playing tricks on you. You start seeing things, and people.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: What happens when the crazy stage is over?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Well, Stefan said that he has a plan. You know, to get her back on track.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Does that plan involve letting her out? Because if he thinks she's giving up on her family...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (frowns) She has to. Bonnie, you already destroyed the Ascendant.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: What if there's a loophole?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Jo walks in and interrupts them)
</p>
<dl><dd> JO: I'm dreading it, but I guess I should think about putting the dress on.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie and Elena stand up, and Jo walks over to them, clearly worried by the looks on their faces)
</p>
<dl><dd> JO: Something's wrong. It's not the dress, is it? <i>Please</i> tell me it's not the dress.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: We were just discussing the fact that there's a desiccating vampire locked in a cell less than fifty feet from where we're getting ready.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: (confused) Did <i>she</i> do something to the dress?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: The dress is <i>fine</i>. I'm just being paranoid.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt arrives at the boarding house and joins them)
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Okay. Truck's here. Who's coming?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena and Bonnie look at him in confusion, so Matt elaborates)
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Caroline suggested in a semi-threatening way that I pick up the centerpieces, which sounds like a Donovan screw-up waiting to happen.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I'll come!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: (gives her a thumbs-up) Thank you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Yeah.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: <i>But</i>, I'm bad at flowers? Yeah, I assumed you knew that.

<p>(He pauses for a moment and sighs)
</p>
<dl><dd> TYLER: Caroline, why am I here?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: (hesitates) I tried to kill you. My humanity was off, but I still tried to kill you, and you're my friend, and... I'm sorry.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: (smiles) That's funny. You and I moved on a while ago, but getting tortured by your ex and her new boyfriend is <i>never</i> good for the ego.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: (defensive) He's <i>not</i> my boyfriend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: Whatever he is, I can't keep up.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LIV: Whatever head injury turned you into a monosyllabic <i>goon</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: Monosyllabic? That's an awful big word for a college drop-out.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LIV: (becomes angry) Oh, I'm sorry. Was I supposed to stay at Whitmore after my ass of a boyfriend told me he never wanted to see me again?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: Hang on, you're mad at me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LIV: I lost my brother and then my boyfriend in the span of a week.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: (exasperatedly) And instead of coming to me, you tried to kill yourself!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LIV: I was hurt.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> TYLER: That doesn't make it okay!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LIV: You're lecturing me on flying off the handle? Wow. You know what? I'm gonna wait outside. Gemini wedding means big-coven-reunion heading this way.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Well, considering the fact that you actually have to <i>eat</i> as a human, I just wanted to give you a little taste of what your dinner's gonna look like.

</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> STEFAN: Let me ask you something, When was the last time you filled out paperwork of any kind... taxes, health insurance, driver's license?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Every idiot in the country does it. You think I'm gonna have trouble with this?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You will, the first time you encounter some moron that you can't kill or compel.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Maybe. (He opens the refrigerator) Then I would just come home and pop a beer from my beautiful stainless steel refrigerator.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Actually it is. See, I won't know where you live. You'll have the cure running through your veins, and if I know where you are, then someone can use me to track you down and take the cure from you and turn you into a 172-year-old corpse.

<dl><dd> STEFAN: What's the matter? Haven't thought that far ahead? See eventually, word will spread, and you and Elena will have to move away. You'll have to isolate yourself, no friends, no family. This will be your life, Damon. This will be your <i>hell</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, that is where your are <i>wrong</i>, my brother. (He grabs a paper out of his pocket and unfolds it) This will not be my life.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (laughs) Ha! It's Damon. He <i>didn't</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: He's ready to do this, Elena. He's got your perfect little life all planned out.

<dl><dd> JO: Hey, remember when you were pacing yourself?

<dl><dd> ELENA: Heh, I do. Right before I told my ex-boyfriend how to get my current boyfriend to give up hope for our relationship. What if I made a huge mistake by taking the cure?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: The only mistake you made was that last glass of champagne. (She grabs the glass from Elena's hand) I'm gonna go make some coffee before you spiral through the earth to China.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (laughs) Yeah, okay.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Jo is about to walk away with the glass when she suddenly gets a weird look on her face and grabs her stomach. She starts to get dizzy, as though she's about to fall, but she leans against the nearby piano for support.

<dl><dd> ALARIC: As in she doesn't want to get married to me panic attack? Great.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: No, as in it's her wedding day and she has two small humans growing inside her, and she can't self-medicate like you, Bourbon-Breath. (Alaric gives her a look) Sorry, I just... I saw her fall, and my first instinct was "Vamp to her," but I couldn't, and then I saw her hit her head, and I wanted to give her vampire blood, but I couldn't.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Wait, so are you having second thoughts?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena shakes her head)
</p>
<dl><dd> ELENA: No, because then I thought, "What would a human do?" So, I called 911, got her to the hospital, and then I let the doctors do their job, and it felt oddly empowering. Why didn't you tell me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Tell you what?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: How <i>amazing</i> it feels to be human again! At first, I was worried that it might take the edge of my senses, but it's the opposite. I feel...connected to the world again. I feel...

<dl><dd> ALARIC: Alive?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (smiles and nods) Yeah.

<dl><dd> LILLY: I heard you tried to bring me something called an, uh, MP3 player? I'm not entirely sure what that is, but still, I wanted to thank you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: And they let you out of your cell to do this?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILLY: Of course not, but I'm resourceful.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: (clearly worried) Hmm. Should I be concerned about an imminent Ripper binge?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILLY: Actually, no, you shouldn't. I was a Ripper because I lost my family, but today I'm getting them back.

<p>(Jo is doing her makeup when her phone vibrates. She answers it)
</p>
<dl><dd> JO: If you're trying to organize a secret rendezvous...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Don't worry, I'm not. I just need help with my vows. What rhymes with battlefield clamp?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: (laughs) Divorce?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Hahaha. So, how are yours coming?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: Stop fishing for spoilers!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: You know this place is crawling with Gemini. Who knew there were so many of you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: Well, there's not much to do in the coven other that procreate. You haven't seen my dad, have you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: No, actually. But, it's big of you to invite your attempted-murderer to your wedding.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: (smirks) He gives <i>really</i> good gifts. Oh and never say, "big of you" to a pregnant woman.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: (chuckles) I hate that I can't see you right now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: I love that you hate it. See you soon.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Bye
</dd></dl>
<p>(They hang up, and Jo returns to putting on her makeup. After a moment, a male voice calls out behind her. It's her father.)
</p>
<dl><dd> JOSHUA: Maybe I should just, uh, leave my gift and go then.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: (surprised) Dad! What are you doing back here?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JOSHUA: You're my daughter, and I, uh... ahem... I don't expect you to say yes but... if I didn't at least ask to walk you down the aisle, I couldn't live with myself.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WEDDING_LOCATION_3"> WEDDING LOCATION </span></h2>
<p>(Caroline has presents in her hands and is about to put them away when she sees Stefan in front of her and quickly turns around, though she freezes in place and doesn't run away)
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: (amused) You're avoiding me.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Caroline turns around and tries to play dumb)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: What? No. I'm not avoiding you. I'm trying to organize this whole circus here. I mean, did you see where they put the bar?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: (gives her a look) Caroline. (He pauses for a moment) Can we talk?
</dd></dl>
<p>(After a moment, Caroline nods. The scene cuts to a nearby bench near the barn, where Stefan is in the middle of catching Caroline up on what she's missed)
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Alright, just say it-- I'm wrong, I'm making this about me, I'm being selfish.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: No. Sorry, not wanting to lose your brother is pretty low on the selfish scale. Forcing someone to turn off their humanity on the other hand? That...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hmm. Yeah, that's uh... that's way up there.
</dd></dl>
<p>(He sees her hand resting between them on the bench and squeezes it with his own)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Yeah. Do you hate me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: No, of course I don't hate you. Doesn't mean that I don't hate the way you handled things.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Well, that makes two of us.
</dd></dl>
<p>(She pulls her hand away, and sighs nervously)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: I made a list... of uhm, all the things that I've done since I fell for you. It started last summer when you moved away. I started obsessing over where you were, wondering why you weren't returning my calls. I told you I hated you when I felt ignored, missing my mom's final moments because I was kissing you. and then she died...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: (interrupts her) --Caroline--
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: (continues on) --And all that I needed was for you to tell me that you felt something for me, and you didn't. And it affected me so deeply that I did the worst possible thing a vampire can do-- I turned off my humanity. And when I thought I couldn't do anything else, I got you to turn off yours.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Well, I forgive you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Yeah, but, that's the point, Stefan. The old Caroline wouldn't have forgiven me. She would've smacked me and said "What the hell are you doing?" And I hate the way that this has made me feel.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: That's because you're a control freak who's lost control. I feel the same way when I'm around you. That's what falling for somebody is. It's being vulnerable. It's-- (He grabs her hand again)-- giving up control.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: I know... but where I'm at right now in my life, with the guilt and the grief, control is all I have. And I don't think that I can give that up.
</dd></dl>
<p>(She sighs and walks away)
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>(Meanwhile, Elena is at the altar making last minute arrangements when Damon walks in. She hears him and turns around)
</p>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (shyly) Hi.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Isn't a bridesmaid's dress supposed to make you look like a freak of nature?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Uh, Jo went easy on me. (She smiles as she walks over to Damon.) I talked to Stefan.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: He did not go easy on me. Apparently that's your fault. His argument was pretty convincing. I'd made up my mind... (Elena's face shows a little sadness.) But then...
</dd></dl>
<p><b>FLASHBACK-- STEFAN'S OLD HOUSE, ~ 2 hours ago</b>
</p><p>(Damon has just crushed the neighbor boy's ball, and now he's angry)
</p>
<dl><dd> BOY: (whines) You ruined my ball!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, you're lucky I didn't ruin your face! (He stares the boy in the eyes and compels him) Go inside, get the car keys from your mommy. I'm going to a wedding.
</dd></dl>
<p>(The boy walks away and a car comes up and pulls into the driveway several houses down.)
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: On second thought...
</dd></dl>
<p>(The old man gets out of the car and opens the passenger door his wife so she can get out.)
</p>
<dl><dd> OLD MAN: Don't forget the...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> OLD WOMAN: The leftovers. I know, you told me three times. Forty years, and every time, (She mocks his voice) "Did you remember the leftovers?" Like I'm getting senile or something.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Just as she's about to walk up to her house, her husband rushes in front of her, grabbing her butt as he does so)
</p>
<dl><dd> OLD WOMAN: Oh!
</dd></dl>
<p>(She smiles at her husband and turns around and kisses him. Afterward, they walk into the house together.)
</p><p><b>PRESENT DAY</b>
</p><p>(Damon smiles at the memory before continuing to speak to Elena)
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'm taking it. I've been a vampire for a long time, Elena. It's been a blast. I would give it up in a <i>second</i> to be your husband. (She smiles happily) Your partner, the father of your kids...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (worried) You can't take it just for me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: That's what you and Stefan keep saying, but you're wrong. I can. I can take it for us. Okay? (Elena looks like she is about to cry) Because even if it doesn't work, even if it all goes to hell, even if I'm miserable and alone, the smallest chance of a perfect life with you is infinitely better than an immortal one without you. And I know this, Elena. I love you... and I will love you until I take my last breath on this earth.
</dd></dl>
<p>(They both smile and Damon leans in and kisses her.)
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>(Outside the barn where Jo and Alaric are getting married, Caroline is leaving Elena a stressed-out voicemail while Stefan and Jo listen in nearby)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: (on the phone) Where the hell are you? Bonnie and Matt are already M.I.A, and now you and Damon? What is wrong with you? This is a wedding. This is supposed to be Jo's magical night, and you are ruining it. We're starting without you.
</dd></dl>
<p>(She hangs up and hears Jo laughing in the background.)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: This is <i>not</i> funny!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: (giggles) It's kind of funny.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Uh, hey, look, I don't want to tell you how to run your wedding, but...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: We're not waiting anymore. Tell them to cue the music.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>(Up in the attic of the barn, there are clothes all over the floor next to where Damon and Elena have just finished making love in a pile of hay, with only a horse blanket over top of them. Damon suddenly hears something with his vampire-hearing while Elena kisses his neck)
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Um, I think it's starting.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (pulls away from his neck) What? No! What time is it?
</dd></dl>
<p>(She looks at her phone and sees five missed phone calls and even more text messages from Caroline.)
</p>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Oh my god. No, no, no, no, we're so late.
</dd></dl>
<p>(They both sit up and start putting on their clothes.)
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, you're the one who couldn't keep your paws off me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (throws him his shirt) Damon, put your tux back on.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: (smiles) I am, I am.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon laughs at her while they get dressed. Once they're finished, they make their way downstairs, where they look slightly rumpled, with sex-hair and several stray pieces of hay stuck in their hair and clothes. Caroline is waiting in the wedding room when they walk in, and she gives them a very unamused look)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Well, I hope it was worth it.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena picks a piece of straw out of Damon's hair.)
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: (smirks) Actually...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Ick, gross! Not the time, okay? Have you seen Bonnie or Matt?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ELENA: (worried) They're not here yet?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Ohh, just go, go. Go, go, go.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Okay.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena and Damon make their way down the aisle to start the wedding. The two link arms, but when they realize that they are in the wrong order, they quickly switch places)
</p>
<hr/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SALVATORE_BOARDING_HOUSE_6"> SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE </span></h2>
<p>(Matt wakes up on the floor of the basement cell and finds Bonnie still unconscious next to him. Unlike Matt, her wrists have been cut, causing her to bleed all over the floor, though someone has taken the time to duct tape her wrists.)
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: (groans in pain) Ugh, Bonnie? (He stands up and walks to her.) Bonnie?
</dd></dl>
<p>(She suddenly wakes up, but is weak from blood loss and can barely speak)
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Hey.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: It was...
</dd></dl>
<hr/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WEDDING_LOCATION_4"> WEDDING LOCATION </span></h2>
<p>(Damon and Elena finally make it to the altar, where they take their places on each side. Damon moves to stand behind Alaric, who turns slightly to whisper to him)
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: (to Damon) And so?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Looks like I'm joining the human club! (Elena smiles at him across the aisle) It's a big night for both of us.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: I'm proud of you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You, too, buddy.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Jo walks, escorted by her father, and everyone turns to watch them meet Alaric and the bridesmaids and groomsmen at the altar. Once everyone is in position, the Reverend begins his homily. Alaric is stunned speechless by the sight of Jo, and they both beam at each other)
</p>
<dl><dd> THE REVEREND: Welcome, family and friends, on this magical evening to the wedding of Alaric Saltzman and Josette Loughlin. Josette and Alaric have prepared their own vows.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: (clears his throat nervously) Ahem.
</dd></dl>
<hr/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WAREHOUSE_DISTRICT"> WAREHOUSE DISTRICT </span></h2>
<p>(Lilly is walking around a block of warehouses outside of town with Enzo following behind her. When Lilly doesn't see anyone nearby, she begins to panic)
</p>
<dl><dd> LILLY: (turns to Enzo) This can't be it. No one's here.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Perhaps your companions gave you the wrong address?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILLY: They're not the ones who gave me the address.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: (confused) Then who did?
</dd></dl>
<hr/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WEDDING_LOCATION_5"> WEDDING LOCATION </span></h2>
<p>(Alaric and Jo are giving their vows during the wedding ceremony)
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Neither one of us should be here right now. We've spend our life dodging fate and beating the odds.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena and Damon look at each other happily while Alaric speaks)
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: But, because we did, I got to meet you, the most beautiful, hilarious and intimidatingly brilliant woman I have ever known. You inspire me, you've shown me that happiness is actually something that I can have in my life. And so... (He grabs the ring from Tyler) I promise to be with you, and love you, and to dodge fate with you-- (He puts the ring on Jo's finger)-- for the rest of our lives.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Jo begins to cry, and the camera cuts to all of the "Mystic Falls Gang" in turn to show their reactions)
</p>
<dl><dd> THE REVEREND: Josette?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: Oh god, that's a tough act to follow. (Everyone laughs) Here it goes-- Alaric Saltzman, you are...
</dd></dl>
<p>(She stops suddenly and gasps loudly, looking weak and in pain. Alaric looks alarmed)
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Jo? Jo? Jo? Oh my god. Jo? Jo? Jo?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Jo starts to sway on her feet as blood begins to pour from the front of her dress, as though she's been stabbed from behind)
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Jo? Oh god, no!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: Aah! Aah!
</dd></dl>
<p>(She falls forward and is caught by Alaric, revealing that Kai is standing behind her with a bloody hunting knife in his hands)
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: No! No, no, no, no.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KAI: I was gonna wait 'til the "death do us apart" bit, but it seemed a little on the nose. Am I right?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alaric is on his knees on the ground now, and he's holding Jo, who is white as a ghost and looks as though she's in bad shape. Joshua stands up from his seat and rushes toward them, but Kai holds up a hand, magically creating a high-pitched noise that incapacitates everyone at the ceremony. Liv, Tyler, Stefan and Caroline, all grab their ears and scream in pain as Kai smiles gleefully)
</p>
<dl><dd> KAI: Miss me? No? Oh well.
</dd></dl>
<p>(The noise Kai has magically created is so powerful that all of the glasses and windows shatter, causing Damon and Elena to fall to the ground. When Elena makes impact, she slams her head against the ground and is knocked unconscious. Damon desperately pulls her up onto his lap and looks devastated as the wedding ceremony erupts into chaos)
