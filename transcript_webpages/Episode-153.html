<p>(The episode picks up from the last. Matt, holding a gun, is unlocking a safe, revealing Caroline's unconscious body. She has blood on her forehead. It flashes to their heated conversation.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (very upset) I have a family, Matt!
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt is seen smiling with Penny. The scene flash forwards to him touch her tombstone, it reads <i>Penny Ares Beloved Partner whose memory is a beacon of [Hope]</i> the final work cannot be seen.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt (voiceover): So did I. And a girlfriend and a life. And now I don't.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan and Alaric are in a restaurant, chatting. It flashes to Stefan's memory when he came to see Caroline in Dallas, TX.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Okay, Stefan, what happened?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan is outside their home, though he turns his back on them when he sees Caroline is happy with Alaric and the new babies.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: You told Caroline you'd be with her once things were safe, and you never showed. You broke her heart.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan sees Caroline kiss Alaric's cheek.)
</p><p>The next scene flashes to Bonnie and Virginia in the Mental Health Center in Asheville, NC.
</p>
<dl><dd> Alex (Voiceover): Virginia forced Lucy Bennett to seal a vault in the Armory with magic.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alex is seen, describing to Enzo what had happed to her sister.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alex: Our other sister Yvette was still inside when they closed it. I need to get her out. Bonnie can help me do that.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alex, or more like an Armory nurse is drawing blood from Rayna.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Enzo (Voiceover): I need to know if the effects of those pills can be reversed.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Enzo is driving in his stolen car, speaking with Rayna, asking for a cure to the pill's side effects.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Rayna: The effects of my blood can't be reversed.
</dd></dl>
<p>(The scene flashes to Enzo holding a gun to Rayna's face.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Rayna: That would mean you just gave the girl you love a death sentence.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie is seen at the Mental health center, taking another pill that suppresses her magic.)
</p><p>(Enzo is watching Rayna scribble down information and drawing of the released phoenix stone vampire's whereabouts while speaking with Damon inside his Safe house.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Enzo: She's still got a mystical connection to all those vampires who escaped the Phoenix Stone.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: I would be happy to wipe out anyone off your list in exchange for a teensy-weensy favor.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Rayna: And what might that be?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: You're on your last mortal life. What we'd like to do is to take that life and transfer it to Bonnie.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon is looking over Rayna, who has collapsed to the floor; many more additional papers with drawings of people and locations are scattered throughout the small room and all across the floor)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Well, the good news is she finally said yes to that deal. The not as good news is she added a few more vampires to the list.
</dd></dl>

<p>(Bonnie is washing her hands, two large scabs can be seen on her hands, resulting from the magic suppression pills. She pulls her shirt off of her shoulder to reveal more. She is trying to hold back tears as she covers up again. She wipes away the tears and makes herself more presentable.)
</p><p>(Bonnie walks down the main hallway up to a nurse at the front desk.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Hi. I'm here to see a patient of yours, Virginia St. John.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Front Desk Nurse: And what is your relationship to the patient?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: She tried to kill me. (said with a dry look upon her face.)
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie is seen speaking with Virginia, who is behind glass.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I don't have a lot of time. And I need answers. Your sister Alex is hell-bent on having me open that vault. I need to know what's in it.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Virginia is a bit more confident in herself.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Virginia: Well, that's the question everyone's been asking since 1882... when my great-grandfather first managed to open it.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Vault_within_the_Armory_--_1882"> The Vault within the Armory -- 1882 </span></h2>
<p>(The scene flashes back to Virginia's great grandfather. He is seen at the Vaults door, opening with a slow creak, Three men and a women is seen holding lanterns behind him as they enter. They each holding up the lanterns to light their way, casting the light on the walls. An unknown woman calls out to Virginia's great grandfather.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Woman's voice (whispering): Dalton...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Dalton: Who's there?
</dd></dl>
<p>(The other men seem confused about hearing another voice in the vault.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Woman's voice: Dalton.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Dalton: Show yourself.
</dd></dl>
<p>(One by one, each of the lights in the lanterns are extinguished. The scene goes dark, nothing but Dalton's screams can be heard.)
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mental_Health_Center_--_Asheville.2C_North_Carolina_2"> Mental Health Center -- Asheville, North Carolina </span></h2>

</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie (more determined): What's in there?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Virginia: It's not a what. It's not a who. It's what it does to you.

<p>(Dalton is grunting as he is dragged out of the Vault by the other four people whom is with him.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Dalton: Shut it.
</dd></dl>
<p>(The old door creaks shut)
</p>
<dl><dd> Dalton: I'm fine. I'm fine. Quite all right.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Dalton's facial expressions have changed, almost like he is excited, instead of horrified, a slight smile graces his lips.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Virginia (voiceover): It strips away your compassion.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Dalton whistling "Pop Goes the Weasel" as he cleans a bloodied blade.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Virginia (Voiceover): It takes away your empathy, your capacity for love...
</dd></dl>
<p>(Dalton remains stoic in his facial features, he places the cleaned blade back on the shelve from where it was retrieved. He turns to walk away and bumps into one of two seen hanging bodies. The bodies are of the companions that were seen earlier that entered the Vault with Dalton.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Virginia: Eating away at your soul, until all that remains... is darkness.
</dd></dl>
<p>(As he walks away, the whistling continues and the camera pans out, revealing all the bodies, hung from the ceiling of the Armory.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Virginia: My great-grandfather was only in there a few moments. My sister Yvette has been trapped in there for four years. (Her voice breaking) And I can't imagine what she's been twisted into in that time.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie seems confused, but tried to convince Virginia.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: No one can survive four years sealed in a vault.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Virgina: I said the same thing. Except Alex can hear her, through the walls, crying to her for help. Whatever's inside that vault, it wants out. And you have to promise me, you won't let Alex set it free.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Virginia stares Bonnie down with determination.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I promise.

<p>(It appears to be mid-morning, Damon is seen throwing an unknown phoenix stone vampire into the windshield of a bus. Ezno is behind him, just watching. He grabs the man and repeatedly hits him in the stomach before ripping out his heart. The man is still alive long enough to see his own heart, and looks up shocked at Damon, right before his head is ripped off as well.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Enzo: (grunting) Rayna's list is too long to kill each one twice.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon throws the latest kill on a pile of dead bodies of other phoenix stone vampires.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Well, then we better get moving.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Enzo pours gasoline over their bodies, intending to burn them.)
</p><p>(Damon's phone begins to ring as they light the bodies on fire as they walk away.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: How's it going?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan is seen pack up the back of his vehicle, in a unknown location, presumably in Huntsville or rather Birmingham.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Finished off the ones in Huntsville and Birmingham.
</dd></dl>
<p>(The camera pans back and forth from Stefan to Damon.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Ah, good. Overachiever. Somebody taking out their aggression because Blondie left them on the front porch? (Damon gives a wily grin.)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Well, Damon, you're the authority on being hated, so why don't you tell me how to deal with the situation.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Still mad, huh?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I'm not mad, I'm just tired. Who's next on my hit list?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Bloodsucker from the Age of Enlightenment. Ended up in a MMA fighter. Dropping bodies all through the Palmetto State.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Doesn't sound very enlightened. That's why I'm partnering you up with Donovan.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan is surprised by this information.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Matt? He wants me dead. He released Rayna to kill me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Bit extreme, even for Donovan.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Long story.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon (voice is over the phone: I don't have time for a short story, Stefan.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt's truck is seen driving up to Stefan in the background.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Listen, you two figure out your differences while killing this MMA fighter.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan turns to see Matt's vehicle park, he is not particularly happy to see Matt.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Oh, I guess I don't really have much of a choice, do I?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Stefan, answering your question about how to deal with being hated, three little words, <i>Just don't care</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: It's funny coming from a guy working so hard to save his friend's life.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: I can live with Bonnie hating me, just as long as she lives. I got to go.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt pokes his head out of the driver's window.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt: I'm driving.

<p>(Alaric is search for something in a green box with a yellow lid. He sets it down on the kitchen table, pulling items from the box. Caroline walks in.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: If you're looking for the crossbow bolts, I moved them in with the Halloween decorations. About the same time that I relocated your shotgun from the kitchen.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alaric is surprised that Caroline has moved his weapons, but grateful.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Thanks.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Stake guns and vervain grenades are in the minivan. I called Leah over to watch the girls. They're going to make puppets and put on a show, gonna have the time of their lives.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alaric and Caroline are both worried about who should go and help Stefan and the others.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: No, you can't go. It's too dangerous.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: More for you than me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: It would be irresponsible if we both went.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Okay, then you can stay here. Because I cannot read 'If You Give a Moose a Muffin' for the millionth time when I know my best friend is in trouble.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Enzo.27s_Safe_House"> Enzo's Safe House </span></h2>
<p>(Bonnie is entering the cabin. Rayna is on the floor in front of a burning fire in the fireplace. Crumpling up a piece of paper.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Rayna: Good-bye, Desmond.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: See the crazy train has moved topside. Is that my shirt?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Rayna: Considering I'm giving you my life, I figured it qualified me for an upgrade from the storm cellar.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Personally, I would've negotiated for the penthouse suite in Paris and dinner at the best restaurant in town where I would've ordered one of everything and had the most expensive bottle of wine and champagne.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Rayna: And when all the names are in the fire, you'll have a whole lifetime to do all of it.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie walks over in front of the couch towards Rayna and the fireplace. Hundreds of papers are spread out all around Rayna.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Guess I don't understand what you're getting out of this. I mean, not to sound ungrateful, but you're willing to die? For me? Just doesn't make any sense.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Rayna reminisces about her first life.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Rayna: That's because you haven't lived seven lifetimes beyond your own. That's what I never understood about vampires. They seek out immortality like it's some kind of gift. Everything that mattered to me, love, family, happiness, I had all of that the first time, until it was taken away from me, and I've spent the last seven lifetimes longing for it.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Rayna throws another crumpled piece of paper into the fire. Sadness begins to spread across her face as she remembers her Father and his love for her.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Rayna: I'm ready to be done on this earth. I want to see my father again. I want to know love again. That's what I get out of it. <i>Peace.</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>(One of the closes pieces of paper catches fire from a popping ember. Bonnie sees the fire begin to spread and naturally reacts to it.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: <i>Motus!</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>(The fire is snuffed out. Bonnie is shocked that her magic has returned.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Rayna: Your magic's back.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie (worried): The pills are out of my system. Which means the Armory's not far behind.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Matt.27s_Truck"> Matt's Truck </span></h2>
<p>(Matt and Stefan are still driving, reluctance to speak between the both of them.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt: With no traffic, we should be in Spartanburg in under two hours.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Do you want me to find a decent radio station to cover up the silence?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt ignores Stefan)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Or we can just talk about your vendetta against me. Seriously, man, whatever's going on, let's just get it all out. I mean, you blackmailed us into leaving our home. Wasn't that enough?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: Second best decision I ever made.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan is confused and is struggling to deal with Matt's attitude)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Do I even want to know what the first is?
</dd></dl>

<p>(Matt is on the bed, his laptop open on his lap. Penny walks in and he quickly shut the computer.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Penny: What were you looking at?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: Nothing.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Penny: Baseball score nothing or porn nothing? That was a pretty sketchy quick-close.
</dd></dl>
<p>(A giant grin spreads across Matt's face as he tried to deflect Penny's suspicions.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt: It's not important.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Fully interested, Penny stalks closer and climbs on the bed with Matt.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Penny: I was kidding, but now I'm kind of intrigued. Come on. Show me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt (smiling): Go away.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Penny: Is it, like, weird and freaky? I think we've reached the point where we can be open and honest about our browser histories. Let's see... ( she squeals as she tries to take the laptop from Matt. She is successful and Matt gives in.)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: Hey.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Penny: What kind of freaky stuff you're into. (She reads the webpage.) Top ten ways... (her smile gradually fades as she gathers the words.) to propose to her.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt has a goofy, boyish, grin spread across his face.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt: Pretty sure this isn't gonna make the list.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Penny closes the computer, smiling.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Penny: Yes.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt (Slightly amused): You haven't even given me a chance to ask.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Penny: I said "yes." Okay.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt reaches into his bedside table, pulling out a small box.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt: Uh, all right, I guess the only surprise is if... to see if I got the size right. (Shock is spreading across Penny's face, her smiling fading for a second time.) Are you rethinking your "yes"?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt opens the box, revealing a beautiful, large Diamond ring.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Penny: First, it's a total home run. If you're trying to impress me, it worked. Second, you don't need to impress me. And I know you can't afford this on a deputy's salary.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: How about on a sergeant's salary?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Penny: You got the promotion?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: It's not official yet. But they mayor tipped me off. "Sergeant Donovan." It's got a nice ring to it, right?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt places the ring on her finger.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Penny: So does "Mrs. Sergeant Donovan."
</dd></dl>
<p>(They embrace in a passionate kiss.)

</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I'm sorry. That's awful.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt finally looks at Stefan.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt (sarcastically): Yeah. Everybody's sorry.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I heard it was a car accident.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt smirks, knowing that the truth has yet been revealed.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt: Lost control of her truck. Hit a tree. That's the official story, anyway.

<dl><dd> Damon: Ah. (beeps) Hey, Bon. How was your field trip to the nut house?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Where's Enzo? He's not answering his phone.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: (drinks from a blood bag) Enzo is currently chasing down a blood enthusiast. What's wrong?

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie (angry): We don't know that they don't know that.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Listen, Bonnie, we are moving on this list, okay? If dropping bodies was an Olympic sport, we'd be on a Wheaties box. Come on, you should be used to this by now, right? I think you've died, what, three times already? Bonnie?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Yeah, here. I just want to say thank you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Well, you're welcome.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I still think it was wrong for you to abandon us, but I... I forgive you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Nope. You are not allowed to use the 'F' word. You don't mean it. You're only saying you forgive me because you don't think that we're gonna pull this off. And look, yeah, it's gonna be tight, Bonnie. But we're gonna make it. You're gonna make it. So I don't accept your forgiveness, you understand? You are gonna have to stay strong, okay?

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Oh, nope. Yeah, I got it. No need to elaborate. Okay. Thanks. Whew, that is five minutes of crazy I am never getting back. Okay, so this is what I got from Rayna. The girl's name is Ashlynn. They guy's name is Wyatt. The rest of her visions are just body parts.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric (confused): Killing spree?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: No, the body parts are Ashlynn and Wyatt's. (Alaric gives Caroline yet another confused glance.) Uh, because they're having sex. Just lots and lots of intense, mind-blowing sex. Uh, Rayna was very descriptive (Caroline is un-appealed, having to continue to describe what Rayna has told her.)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Huh. Well, that's-that's good. Well, hopefully the afterglow will distract them. (Caroline smirks towards Alaric.) I mean, should I feel even the slightest twinge of guilt about this?

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: You got lots of privacy. Plenty of neighborhoods to grab somebody from. Feed at your leisure. Stash the bodies, no trace. Won't have to worry about someone like you coming after them. Which makes me curious. You did such a good job clearing vampires out of Mystic Falls. What makes you convinced that Penny's death wasn't a car accident?

<dl><dd> Matt: Little things just didn't add up. There were no tire marks on the road. (MAtt continues to search the house.) The impact sent a tree limb through the driver's side of the cab, yet the air bag didn't deploy. You know, everyone said that I was obsessed and that I wouldn't let it go, but you know what it reminded me of? All the deaths that were covered up as animal attacks. (He stops and faces Stefan again.) The more I dug, the less sense it made.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> Damon: No, I don't want applause. But it'd sure be damn nice to hear you admit you considered making the same deal. But you knew you'd lose her. But lucky for you, you have me. Because she hates me. It's humanly impossible for her to hate me any more than she already does. So I did what you couldn't. And now she'll hate me, not you.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie approaches, hurrying to leave.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Let's grab Caroline and Alaric and get the hell out of here. Come on. Now! Run! (They leave the Armory.)
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alex crosses the threshold into the Vault.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alex (worried): Be ready for anything.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Guards enters the vault, followed by Alex. They slowly look for Alex's sister.
</p>
<dl><dd> Alex: Yvette! Yvette?!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Yvette (Voice whispering): Alexandria.
</dd></dl>
<p>(She looks around confused and worried.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alex: I'm here.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Yvette (Voice whispering) Alexandria.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alex: Where are you?!
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alex sees a body on the floor and rushes towards her sister. As she gets closer, she realizes that her sister had long since perished and is nothing but a dried corpse.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alex: (Smiling) Yvette! (Realization of the truth, shock spreads across her face.) No!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Yvette (Voice whispering) Alexandria.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alex (screaming, and full of guilt and pain): What have you done to my sister?!
</dd></dl>
<p>(The quiet voices whispering indistinctly gradually gets louder. Two of the Armory guards are pulled into the darkness.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alex (Horrified and Screaming): Run!
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alex and two guards run out of the Vault. The second guard, who is behind Alex, is forcefully pulled back into the Vault. Alex turns to find that he is already gone. Alex and more guards run towards the two large front Armory doors. They are shut and they can't seem to get out as they beat on the large doors.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Armory Guard: Check all the exits. Go.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Outside_the_Armory"> Outside the Armory </span></h2>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: <i>Phasmatos veras nos ex malom. Terra mora vantis quo incandis per vasa quo errum signos</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alex and the others are still trapped inside the Armory. She recognizes Bonnie's voice outside the door.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alex: Bonnie?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon is unaware of what Bonnie is doing, casting another spell. Enzo is shocked as well.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: What did you just do?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Kept my promise. No one's getting out.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alex (horrified they can't escape): Bonnie, please!?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alex begs to be let out. Bonnie finally succumbs to the poison and use of her magic and collapses on the front grounds of the Armory. Enzo catches her before she hits the ground and cradles her in his arms.)
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spartanburg.2C_South_Carolina_4"> Spartanburg, South Carolina </span></h2>
<p>(Matt is sitting outside the house where they killed the vampire earlier that day, night time has fallen. Stefan approaches him from behind.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: (sighing) Look, I just didn't want you to be consumed by one moment in your life that you couldn't take back.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt is overcome with grief, though is still directing his anger towards Stefan.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt: I released Rayna and helped her kidnap Caroline to punish you for something I did.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Can't blame yourself, Matt.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: I don't. I blame you. I may have pulled the trigger, but none of this would have happened if you hadn't come back. Why couldn't you have just stayed away from us?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I only came back...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt (Angry and confused): For Caroline. Yeah, I know. But it sounds like she didn't want that, so why don't you just stay away from her too? You ruined my life, Stefan. And you ruined Penny's life too. Whose life are you gonna ruin next?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Matt's eyes are wet and red from tears as he turns and walks away from Stefan.)
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Salvatore_Boarding_House"> Salvatore Boarding House </span></h2>
<p>(Bonnie is semi-conscious, laying on the couch. Enzo is with her, holding her hand and caressing the side of her face.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Enzo: It won't be long now, my darling. Damon and Rayna will take it from here. Just... hang in there. (Smiling) Caroline's making you her apparently famous "get well" soup.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: (groans) That soup is awful.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Caroline is in the kitchen, stirring and smelling the 'get-well' soup. She appears to have remembered something she'd forgotten.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Tomorrow is the first rehearsal for the May Day pageant. (Alaric is there, watching her cook.) I signed the girls up for Maypole duty. What are we supposed to tell the teachers? "Sorry, Miss Patty. We missed rehearsal because we were off slaughtering vampires."
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alaric is trying to be supportive, though putting his family first.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: We can get in the car right now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: No, not before I know that Bonnie's gonna be okay. God only knows how many more ways Damon can screw this up by the end of the day.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alaric presses her further.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Are you sure that's the only reason?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Yeah. Why else would I want to stay? (Alaric gives her a 'knowing look'.) No, I do not want to see Stefan, okay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: I just want to know. You left things unfinished.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline (angrily): Oh, things are finished. He finished them when he just Ashlynn'd his way out of town three years ago. And did you see how she just bailed on Wyatt like that? He was her partner, and then the minute things got a little bit messy, she just ran away. I mean, do you see anything about a disaster of a love affair like that that needs finishing?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Look, I really don't want to talk about Ashlynn or Wyatt.
</dd></dl>
<p>(They both are frustrated with how the conversation has turned.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Well, I'm not talking about Wyatt and Ashlynn, I am just talking about partnership and commitment and loyalty and honesty and all those things that Stefan just took away from me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: I understand, but there hasn't been any closure.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: I don't need closure.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric (determined): No, I do! I need closure. I don't know if you remember, but my last wedding didn't go so well. So if you think that there's a chance that you and Stefan, uh, might find your way back together again, I'd like to know before I pick out my tie. No, because I want to marry you, and I want to be your loyal, honest, committed partner. And I want our little family to work. (A sad expression crosses his face.) But I don't want it if you'd rather be with someone else.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Caroline tries to console Alaric, but continues to shift the argument.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Look, I love our little family, Ric. It's unconventional. But ( she chuckles) I'm happy. So if this is the big conversation where we're honest about our life together, then I think we should talk about the fact that you're the one unfulfilled by it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: What do you mean?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: I saw you today. In that place. We were being held captive, and all you could talk about was some stupid necklace. It's pretty clear that you've been just Indiana Jones-ing for something like that for a while now. Look, we've been trying so hard to have a normal life, but you know what, our life is not normal. Our kids are witch siphons, for God sakes. (Alaric smiles at her.) We are pretty deep in this. And if that's the way that it has to be, I want to be deep in it with you. Okay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Okay.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mystic_Falls_Woods_Grounds"> Mystic Falls Woods Grounds </span></h2>
<p>(Damon and Rayna walk the grounds of the woods. They approach the Shaman and a small bonfire)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Well, I can't say I'm gonna miss you, stabby-pants, but you are doing a grande solid for Bonnie. I figure that deserves a "thank you," even in my own twisted book.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Rayna: You're welcome.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: All right. Bonfire, check. Last descendant of the tribe that created you... by the way, thank you for that... check. Bonnie's O-neg, check.
</dd></dl>
<p>(He hands the shaman a small vial of blood.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Shaman: It is a great honor to meet you, Rayna.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, we're in a bit of a hurry here, okay? So if you can get on with the shamaning...
</dd></dl>
<p>(The Shaman takes the original blade -- the blade that sacrificed the original shamans -- and pours Bonnie's blood down across the blade. He and Rayna sit cross legged on opposite sides of the bonfire. He begins his plead to Nature.)
</p><p>(The scene flashes back to Caroline and the others. She is bringing Bonnie a bowl of her soup.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Shaman: Hear me, Great Spirit. Hear me. We call upon you in this moment of need. One has come before you. For many lifetimes as your servant, your vengeance... let her journey end. Let another take her remaining years... Let another take up her burden.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon (confused): Wait, what? What does that mean?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Rayna (smiling as her plan comes full circle): Do you think I could ever forgive you for the things you did to me? Now neither will Bonnie. When she wakes, she'll be just like me, full of hatred for you and your kind and unable to rest until you've been wiped from this earth.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Rayna.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Rayna plunges the blade coated in Bonnie's blood into her chest, gasping as she quickly dies.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Rayna!
</dd></dl>
<p>(The spell is complete and the status of Huntress has successfully been transferred to Bonnie. At the Salvatore boarding house where Bonnie laid on the couch, suddenly bursts awake, sitting up right as the spell takes affect of her.)
