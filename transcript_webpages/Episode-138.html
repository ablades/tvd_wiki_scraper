<p><i>[A sad-looking Bonnie is sitting silently in a chair in a plain-looking room. She's not wearing any makeup, and she looks very troubled. After a moment, a woman speaks to her softly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> WOMAN: Bonnie, is there something you wanted to talk about?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie hesitates for a moment before she replies]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I guess, um... I've been thinking a lot about the past lately. How one stupid decision can...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie takes a deep, nervous breath]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: ...Can turn your life into something that you don't recognize. Like it belongs to someone else. I made a mistake, and I lost someone I loved... And I'd do anything to take it back, but I can't. All I can do is...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie gulps anxiously as a tear falls down her cheek, and she quickly wipes it away]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: ...Try and find a way to live with it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie squirms nervously in her seat and clears her throat. The camera pans away, revealing that Bonnie is wearing pajamas and slippers as she sits in a circle with six similarly dressed people in a psychiatric facility. The woman leading the group therapy smiles at her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> WOMAN: Thank you, Bonnie.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The woman jots a note on her clipboard before turning to the person next to Bonnie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> WOMAN: Alex, is there something you'd like to share with the group?
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
<i>[After group therapy is over, Bonnie returns to her room, and when she turns on her light, she's surprised to see Enzo waiting for her there. Bonnie's expression is a mix of surprise, concern, and relief]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: What are you doing here?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo stands to his feet to greet her, looking grim]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Things are bad out there, love. You can't hide in here forever.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie pauses for a moment before smiling and lunging for Enzo. She wraps her arms around his neck and starts making out with him, and Enzo happily returns the kiss]</i>

<p><i>[Bonnie arrives at Alaric's apartment with a cardboard box in her hands. Alaric is sitting at Jo's bedside, where she is fast asleep]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Hey, how's she doing?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[worriedly]</i> I don't know. She's been sleeping for twelve hours. That's normal, right?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie side-eyes him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Yesterday she was dead. Today she's alive. I'm not sure normal applies.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric notices the box in Bonnie's hands]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Please tell me that's food.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Term papers. They were jamming up your inbox. You are <i>still</i> employed as a professor here.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric stands up to take the box from her and smiles]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Hey, do you want a job as my new TA? All you have to do is write, "Interesting point," in a few margins and then give everyone a B+.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Tempting, but I need to figure out exactly how I brought your wife back to the land of the living.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Look. She's here. She's okay. What does it matter now?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[gives him a look]</i> Because in less than 24 hours, I raised two people from the dead with a sketchy spell and something called a Phoenix stone... No research, no rehearsal time, and no contingency plan. And now that I have a little breathing room, I want to figure out what kind of magic I was dealing with just in case I opened up Pandora's rock. So, can I have it back, please?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric sighs and pulls the Phoenix Stone out of a small box on an end table where he hid it. He holds it out to Bonnie, who reaches out to take it, only for him to yank it away with a smile. He then puts the stone in Bonnie's hand, and she smiles at him before she turns to leave. Once Bonnie is gone, Jo starts to stir awake, and Alaric rushes back to her side, smiling excitedly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Oh, hey. Hey, sweetheart, how you feeling?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Jo looks confused for a long moment as she sits up and looks around. After a moment, she looks up at Alaric]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JO: I'm starving.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[This pleases Alaric, who laughs in relief]</i>

<p><i>[Caroline and Stefan are still spooning in Caroline's bed after they had sex the previous night. Caroline is awake and looks antsy, and Stefan pretends to still be asleep for a moment before she finally speaks]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: This is torture for you, isn't it?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline, embarrassed for having been called out, lies badly to him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: No...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[It's clear that Stefan doesn't believe her, and he just smiles in amusement]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hmm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: No! I'm so happy just lying here and doing nothing. Just... listening to you... <i>breathe</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Mmhmm. Just making a mental checklist of all the things you need to do today? Debating whether you should accidentally kick me awake?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline smiles and turns so she can face him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Uh, did you say kick, or did you say <i>kiss</i>?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hmm?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline grabs the back of Stefan's head and pulls him close to her so she can kiss him, and they both hum happily as they make out]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Mmm...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Damon walks into the room, startling Caroline and Stefan, who are still only barely dressed. In his hands is a cardboard cup holder with three coffees in it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Good morning, lovebirds!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan and Caroline roll away from each other and cover up with blankets as they groan in annoyance]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Oh...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Are you kidding me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[smiles awkwardly]</i> I brought you some free-range, overpriced coffee... One cream, two sugars, just like you like it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline stands up, wrapping her comforter around her body modestly as Stefan covers himself up with the sheet]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Actually, I hate sugar in my coffee.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Mmm.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline walks past Damon and into the bathroom to change into some clothes, while Stefan continues to look annoyed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Is there any particular reason as to why you are barging into my girlfriend's dorm room at the crack of mid-morning?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon picks up Stefan's discarded tshirt and tosses it at him. Stefan starts to get dressed while Damon continues to talk]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Why such a Grumpy Gus? I thought you'd want to celebrate today. I finally got Elena tucked away safely. You're snuggled with Caroline in this <i>tragically</i> tiny bed, and Ric? Ric saved his lady from the great beyond! Everything is coming up Salvatore, so much so that I have decided to turn over a new leaf.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> Oh, good.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yeah. I am gonna be the man that does right by Elena, all on my own, by keeping her in my heart instead of keeping her underfoot.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[nods]</i> That's interesting.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'm gonna need a little help with the dirty work, so rise and shine, brother. We are going to interrogate a tall, beautiful Heretic with a terrible attitude.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[At the sound of this statement, a fully-clothed Caroline comes out of the bathroom]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Valerie?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Rings a bell.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When Damon sees the tense look on Stefan's face, he becomes confused]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hmm. I'm missing something here.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Oh, Stefan and Valerie are old flames from way back, and they haven't had a face-to-face since she came tumbling out of that prison world.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When Damon realizes who she's talking about, his mouth gapes open in shock as he looks at Stefan, who is becoming more embarrassed by the second]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hang on. Valerie as in v-card Valerie? "Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am," broke your heart and, uh...?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan squeezes his eyes shut in horror, and when Damon remembers Caroline is listening, he trails off without giving more details. Caroline gives him a look before cheerfully making her suggestion]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: You know what? I think this would be the perfect opportunity for you two to catch up! Unless there's a reason it would be uncomfortable for you...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[warily]</i> No...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Great! Have fun.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline walks toward the door to leave, and Damon smiles and wiggles his fingers at her. Once she's gone, Damon gives Stefan a curious look, and Stefan sighs]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SALVATORE_BOARDING_HOUSE"> SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Enzo has just brought Oscar a blood bag, and he drinks it hungrily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Enjoy it, mate. It's the last of it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Lily comes into the room]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Good morning, Oscar.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She turns to Enzo and smiles, and he smiles back awkwardly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: It was kind of you to sit with him all night.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Oh, I've had a few bad nights myself over the years.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The maid, Lucy, walks in with a large vase of flowers, and Lily points to the nearby table]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Right here, please, Lucy. Thank you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Oh, what's the occasion?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: My mother always used to keep fresh flowers when expecting guests. I suppose I picked it up from her.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo's polite smile falls]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Ah, Julian, I presume.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[awkwardly]</i> Yes. Yes, he'll arrive home today, if all goes as planned. This is a good thing, Lorenzo. I hope you can be happy for me, There's no reason the two of you shouldn't get along.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo turns his back to Lily to check on Oscar, who has finished his blood bag]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[sarcastically]</i> Yeah, thick as thieves, I reckon.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise stomps into the room, followed closely by Nora, which interrupts their conversation]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[pouts]</i> I want to drive, but Beau won't give me the keys.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA; Well, that's because you keep hitting cats and utility poles.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The girls stop when they see Oscar staring at them blankly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: He's <i>still</i> sitting there?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily nods worriedly, and Nora rushes over to sit next to Oscar on the couch]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: Oscar? Darling, it's Nora. Do you... Do you remember me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[concerned]</i> I don't like this. Oscar's meant to be laughing and making jokes.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise leans over to look Oscar in the eyes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Guess what, Oscar? Julian's coming back. Life's about to get fun again.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: So fun!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When Oscar doesn't respond to this news and continues to sit blankly on the couch, she becomes even more concerned and turns to Lily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: Right. Well, he's clearly unwell. We can't just leave him here.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily seems to agree, though she looks guilty as she looks down at Enzo, who does not look at all happy]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Lorenzo, you wouldn't mind keeping an eye on him, would you? We won't be long.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[feigns politeness]</i> Happy to help.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: Thank you. And, if you hear from Valerie, please tell her to come home immediately. I know I was stern yesterday, but that's no reason to sulk.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily looks up at Mary Louise and Nora, gesturing for them to follow her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Come on, girls.

<p><i>[Valerie is in a black SUV and is driving along Route 9 with one phone in each hand; one to use as a GPS system, and one to use as a phone. When one of the phones ring, she sees it's Enzo and answers it, swerving wildly as she does so]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[panicked]</i> Where are you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Headed out to find Julian, and trying to find the directions on Oscar's <i>stupid</i> phone. Why doesn't anyone use real maps anymore? What's wrong with paper?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Well, I suggest you get a move on, because Lily and company are right behind you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: What? That's impossible. You promised to keep Oscar quiet.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[angrily]</i> Oh, Oscar? He doesn't remember squat. They must have tracked Julian down on their own with a locator spell or some other Heretic malarkey. Never underestimate Lily's relentless devotion to getting what she wants.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie holds the phone she's using to talk to Oscar in front of her face, looking concerned]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Wait. What does it mean when the little bar thing goes all red? I...

<dl><dd> VALERIE: Hello?

When she looks back up at the road, she looks alarmed and slams on the brakes as hard as she can.

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[appalled]</i> No seat belt?

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: That's a hefty fine, young lady!

<dl><dd> VALERIE: How did you...?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> Little bird-brain said you stole his car and sped out of Mystic Falls.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie gets out of the car to continue talking to Damon as he walks toward her]</i>

<dl><dd> DAMON: You <i>did</i> realize that by taking a deputy's SUV that every move you made would be tracked, right?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[unamused]</i> Would you <i>kindly</i> move your car?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon plays dumb and turns to point at his Camaro]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>That</i> car? You bet I'll move that car. But first, I need to ask you why you killed your faux-brother Oscar and framed me for the murder.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie also plays dumb]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I have no idea what you're talking about.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[shrugs]</i> You're right. I might not be 100% on my detective work. It's possible that <i>another</i> Heretic turned him into a desiccated corpse. I'm not sure.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon turns back toward his car]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'm gonna go to my car, get my phone. I'm gonna call Lily. See if she knows.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, Valerie, losing her temper, thrusts her hand forward and casts a pain infliction spell on Damon that brings him to his knees as he clutches his throat]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[sarcastically]</i> Fine. You're a genius. What on <i>earth</i> made you think I wouldn't do the same to you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[gasps]</i> Hey, we're just talking, here...

<p><i>[Stefan appears out of nowhere behind Valerie and calls out to her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Valerie.

</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Wow. You're either completely insane, or the most secure woman in the world.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[laughs]</i> I want him to work things out with her. He has this habit of bottling up all his hurt feelings, and I think it would be really good for him if they could just clear away all the 19th-century drama so they can get on with their lives. Clean slate.

<dl><dd> DAMON: And then, you were supposed to meet after that, right? Like, under a bridge, or a tree, or a romantic park bench...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[irritably]</i> Will you <i>please</i> just shut up?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon ignores him and turns to Valerie, who looks just as unhappy as Stefan, if not more]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You know, when you didn't show, this guy wrote ten pages in his journal about how the sun would never shine as bright, and the food would never taste as sweet...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan rolls his eyes at him in annoyance]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yes. I read them. Your hiding places were always crap.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon turns back to Valerie, who is squirming uncomfortably in her seat]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You really crushed the guy.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan shoots a bitter look at Valerie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Well, she was just spying for Lily. I mean, it was all a game, wasn't it?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie stares at him, breathing heavily as she tries to not look hurt and offended by this insinuation before turning to silently look out the window]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Ouch!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon leans back in his seat, patting Stefan affectionately on the arm as he does so]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: But, yeah. No! Hey, hey, keep going man. This bit is, uh, absolutely <i>hilarious</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie, looking overwhelmed, sighs before interrupting their banter]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: No. <i>Please</i> stop. The only thing that matters now is that we find Julian and make sure he can't come home. So, if you're not in, spare me the car ride and let me out.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon quickly leans forward again to answer for Stefan]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No. Stefan's in. He's in! I'll watch.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> He's... turning over a new leaf.

<dl><dd> JO: That's a TV. I'm Jo. You're Alaric, but you go by Ric because it's an odd name, and we're married.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Let's not worry about the details right now. It's gonna take a little time for your memories to come back.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Jo silently continues to eat the food in front of her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JO: This is amazing. Did you make it?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: No. It's, uh... It's delivery.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Jo gives Alaric a confused look, so Alaric elaborates]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Made somewhere else and then someone drives it over. It's Thai food, your favorite.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Jo picks up another bite of food off of her plate with her fork and is about to eat it when Alaric stops her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Well, except for that. That's meat. You don't eat meat.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JO: <i>[more confused]</i> Why would I not eat meat?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[awkwardly]</i> I have no idea.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Jo eats the bite of meat anyway and seems to enjoy it, so Alaric changes the subject]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Hey, look. Let's open this bottle of wine, huh? It's got to be 5:00 in the afternoon somewhere, right?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When Alaric tries to unscrew the cork, the glass end breaks and cuts his hand open, causing him to yelp in pain]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Ooh! Ah! Ah!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Jo instinctively grabs his hand and examines the bleeding wound, surprising Alaric]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JO: It's not serious. Do you have bandages? I'll wrap it for you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric seems taken aback by this, but he recovers quickly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Medicine cabinet above the sink.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Jo stands to her feet and smiles weakly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JO: Be right back.

<dl><dd> STEFAN: Some gas station in the middle of nowhere.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, eavesdropping on their conversation, raises his voice to talk to Caroline from the gas pump]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Don't worry, Care-Bear! I have issues a "No Hanky-Panky" zone. No former flames will reignite on my way! Uh-uh. No how.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan, annoyed, walks away so he can have more privacy]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Sorry about that. The fumes are, uh, getting to his brain. Hey, listen-- uh, I want to take you to dinner tonight.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Like a date?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline thinks about this for a brief moment before interjecting]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Wait, is this because you're feeling guilty for spending the day with your ex?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[chuckles]</i> No, it's because I realized that I haven't actually taken you out yet.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[While they talk, Valerie casually listens in on their conversation and scowls unhappily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Well, I'd love that. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit guilty for pushing you into a car with your brother and your ex, whom you clearly want nothing to do with.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Ah. No, don't feel guilty. I... I needed a push.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline frowns suddenly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Why? What, did she make a move on you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[quickly]</i> Nothing happened. I just needed to hear that our time together was a lie.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[incredulously]</i> She admitted that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: She didn't deny it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[awkwardly]</i> ...Are you okay, or whatever?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I will be, once you tell me what time I'm picking you up tonight.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[smiles]</i> Eight o'clock. And, I like daisies, by the way, just in case you wanted to get me flowers...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie scowls even harder at the sound of Stefan and Caroline planning their date]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[smiles back]</i> I'll see you tonight.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[An irritated Valerie grabs a portable gas tank out of the back of the SUV and drops it loudly in front of Damon, who has just finished filling up their vehicle]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Fill this up.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: There's more gas in the tank, sassy-pants.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I need an accelerant to burn Julian's body. Don't want to take any chances.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[confused]</i> Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself? We haven't even killed the guy yet.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[annoyed]</i> Are you <i>really</i> that daft? We don't need to kill him.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon frowns, obviously not understanding what she's talking about]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: What are you gonna do, charm him to death?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Julian's <i>dead</i>. He's been dead since 1903.

</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie continues to look around the parlor despite Enzo's warnings]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[smiles]</i> Should we spend a few moments catching up before I throw you out? How was your summer holiday? Meet any charming Euro-hunks? Girl, please tell me you didn't just follow Damon around with spare bottles of bourbon...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[gives him a look]</i> I didn't, but it's sweet of you to be concerned about my love life.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Well, I do admire your nerve, sticking around. Now, myself? I'd be flat-hunting on the other side of the planet if I were the only thing standing between Damon Salvatore and his everlasting happiness with Elena. Maybe the danger gives you a thrill? It could be a case of puppy love...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie smiles fakely and looks him in the eyes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: See, now I think you're projecting. You're the one sleeping at Lily Salvatore's feet, hoping for some of her good table scraps.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo, no longer amused by their game, grabs Bonnie by the shoulders and leads her toward the front door]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Good talk. Nice of you to stop by.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie slips out of his grip and turns to face him once again]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Um, I need to talk to Oscar.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[suspiciously]</i> What about?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[casually]</i> Witch business. <i>Super</i> boring.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Well, I'm afraid Oscar is not feeling quite like himself today, so maybe another time.

</p>
<dl><dd> LUCY: UHH! UGH!

</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[compels her]</i> Clean yourself up and take a spa day. Forget all about Mr. Chompers and his very bad manners.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Oscar's mouth is coated in blood, and he stares at them blankly as Bonnie slowly and hesitantly walks toward him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Hello, Oscar. Hey, do you remember me? We met in Myrtle Beach.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> OSCAR: <i>[warily]</i> I've never been to Myrtle Beach. But, I do remember you... from that dark room in the basement. You're the one who got me out?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie looks confused, and Enzo seems intrigued by how Oscar and Bonnie know each other]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Out of where?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Oscar's vampire eyes start to flicker out as he glares at her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OSCAR: I think I'm still hungry.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[anxiously]</i> Um, okay... Just get a grip on yourself for five minutes, and we'll get you more blood. I came to ask you about the Phoenix Stone.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[At the sound of that name, Enzo looks at both Bonnie and Oscar with interest. However, Oscar just becomes more agitated]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OSCAR: What stone? Why do people keep asking me questions I don't know the answer to?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Oscar starts pacing around as he becomes more and more overwhelmed, and Bonnie pulls the Phoenix Stone out of her bag and shows it to him. Enzo's eyes flicker in recognition as he realizes that it's the same stone Lily wanted him to find]</i>

</dd></dl>

<p><i>[At a large LOT OF WAREHOUSES, Valerie, Damon, and Stefan have just arrived and are walking toward the nearest one]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Why would Oscar stash Julian's body out here in the middle of nowhere when he could just hand him over to Lily?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon throws aside a couple of large, flat pieces of wood leaning against the door to the warehouse and grunts as Valerie watches]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Mmm!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Because he knew the moment Lily gets Julian back, the fun's over. Everything changes.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon uncovers the door to find that it is bolted shut with at least five different locks; some are deadbolts, others are padlocked shut. Stefan looks over at Valerie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: So, you killed him. That makes a lot of sense.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[hurt]</i> I told you. I have my reasons.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon starts breaking each of the locks in turn as Stefan and Valerie continue talking]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You know, I was thinking... It's probably a good thing that you and I cut things short. I mean, what if I'd accidentally insulted your driving, and you had no choice but to run a butcher knife through me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[rolls her eyes]</i> Yeah, it doesn't exactly sound like you've lived the life of a saint either. Surprise! The world changes people. You must have figured that out by now.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon breaks the last lock and turns toward Stefan and Valerie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hey, lovebirds! Quit your bickering. Let's get this campfire started.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The three walk into the warehouse, and the door slams shut behind them. Inside is row after row after row of shelves that run from the floor to nearly the ceiling, all of which are full of hundreds of coffins. They all look confused]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Huh. Casket Emporium. Clever.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[groans]</i> Oscar and his stupid pranks!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[They start to look around the warehouse in search of what they're looking for]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: So, Lily's still carrying a torch for some moldy, old corpse, hmm?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Lily is determined to reunite Julian's body with his lost soul. But, in order to do that, she needs the Phoenix Stone.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, alarmed, shoots a look at Stefan and tries to play dumb]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Phoenix Stone, huh? Never heard of it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[It is obvious that Valerie doesn't believe him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Really? That's funny, since you <i>clearly</i> used it on Oscar.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[alarmed]</i> Who said we used it on Oscar?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[rolls her eyes]</i> Oscar was dead, and you needed something to trade for your girlfriend in the box. So, you fooled around with it and found a temporary solution. But hey, good on you. Whomever you brought back seemed to pull the wool over Lily's eyes.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, now very concerned, stops walking and stares at Valerie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Wait-- what do you mean, whoever we brought back?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie sighs in exasperation]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: The Phoenix Stone is stuffed full of <i>very old</i> vampire souls. You didn't raise Oscar from the dead, you clods! You jammed one of those souls into his body.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
<i>[Later, Damon calls Bonnie, who is still at the SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: How's everything with Professor Frankenstein and his rebooted bride?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Good, I think. She was asleep when I left.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[It's clear by the look on Damon's face that he's panicked and dreading the next part of the conversation]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Oh, good. Glad to hear it. So, quick favor-- I'm gonna need you to tell Ric that we made a tiny mistake, and that that's <i>not</i> his wife.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[stunned]</i> What?!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yeah... It turns out that the stone doesn't actually have any magic juice to bring back any old corpse. It's more like a supernatural holding cell for a bunch of lost vampire souls, one of which you accidentally shoved into Jo's body.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[horrified]</i> Oh, my God. That mean's Oscar is...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[finishes her sentence]</i> ...Oscar's just some random vampire in a Heretic candy shell.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[worried]</i> Damon, I came to your house to talk to him about the stone.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon is visibly horrified by this information]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Bad idea! Cut the conversation short. Call Ric from the car on the way home.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[scoffs]</i> Oh, no! Don't put this on me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[guiltily]</i> Well, I'm sorry. And, I'm trying to do this thing where I do right by Elena, and I just... I...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon hesitates for a brief moment]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: ...I just don't think that she'd want me to crush his spirit like that. Let him down gently?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[annoyed]</i> Is this you doing right by Elena, or you not wanting to break your best friend's heart?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, knowing he's just been called out, doesn't reply, and Bonnie sighs]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Fine, but you <i>owe</i> me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[relieved]</i> Thanks, Bon-Bon.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The two hang up their respective phones. At the SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE, Enzo comes into the room to talk to Bonnie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Found Oscar a few blood bags stashed in the study. Probably expired, but he does <i>not</i> seem picky.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie, looking uncomfortable, gets ready to leave with the stone in her hand]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I have to head back to Whitmore.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo grabs her by the arm and stops her, causing her eyes to widen in alarm]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: I meant to ask you about this pretty stone. Where'd you find it?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[sarcastically]</i> Rocks 'R' Us. It was on sale.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo moves his hand down so he's tightly gripping Bonnie's wrist so he can see the stone better. Bonnie clutches the stone as hard as she can to keep him from taking it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: That's funny. Lily's been looking for one just like it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[anxiously]</i> Oh, bargain bin was full of them. I'm sure they have more.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[smirks]</i> Or, I could just take this one.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie yanks her arm out of his grip]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I don't think so.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, Oscar, who has finished eating his blood bags, rushes in and stalks toward them as he freaks out]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OSCAR: I'm not going back in there!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie freezes in terror as Oscar grabs Bonnie by the back of the head and vamps-out. However, before he can bite into her neck, she casts a silent pain infliction spell that causes him to groan in pain and fall backward. Once she stops hurting him, he quickly scrambles into a defensive position]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OSCAR: No! I'm not going back!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Oscar lunges for Bonnie again, but before he can get close, Enzo vamp-speeds toward him and flings him backward into the wood and glass coffee table, which shatters under him. Enzo then turns back to Bonnie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: What the hell is he talking about?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Let's just say you were right-- Oscar's not himself today.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Once again, Oscar gets back up on his feet, this time even more agitated and upset than before]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OSCAR: Why does everyone keep calling me Oscar? <i>My name's not Oscar!</i>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The force of not-Oscar's yell is so loud that it triggers his magic, which causes the overhead lights to explode into a shower of sparks. The three of them are all shocked by this development]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OSCAR: Did I do that?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Oscar, now calmer and visibly curious about his powers, slowly waves his hands through the air, causing the chandelier to fall to the ground with a crash, causing Bonnie to flinch in fear. Bonnie, realizing not-Oscar has learned his additional Heretic powers, stares at them menacingly as Bonnie runs for the door]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[to Enzo]</i> Run!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo, looking confused, looks around for a moment as Bonnie rushes out into the hallway. He sees the Phoenix Stone on the floor and picks it up before he runs after Bonnie. Oscar storms after them in pursuit shortly afterward]</i>

<dl><dd> STEFAN: You know, we got Nora to siphon that repulsion spell you put on Caroline... Just in case you were wondering.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie is visibly upset by this, but quickly covers it up so Stefan can't see and shrugs]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Oh. I'd forgotten all about that.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Why'd you do it? I mean, you couldn't have been worried about Caroline's safety.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie stops what she's doing, clearly offended by his insinuations]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: What do you want me to say? Because I'm pure evil? Because I like seeing people suffer?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Well, if that's the truth, then yeah.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[sighs]</i> I'm not a horrible person.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[frowns]</i> Really? Well, then who are you? I mean, you turned my life upside-down. You leave, you show no remorse, and then you go after my girlfriend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[coldly]</i> You know <i>nothing</i> about me.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The two of them silently return to searching the coffins, until Stefan attempts to open a shiny black one next to him, only for it to remain sealed shut. He rattles the lid, but when it still doesn't work, he calls out to the others]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: This one won't open.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie walks over to the coffin, followed by Damon, as they examine the coffin]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Must be sealed shut.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie pulls the coffin out away from the other shelves. She then lays her hand flat on the coffin, and the place where her skin makes contact with it glows red as she siphons the spell locking it until it's gone. She then opens the coffin, revealing Julian's body. His skin isn't desiccated-- he simply looks as though he's sleeping, though there is a large bloodstain on the left side of his chest]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[confused]</i> Doesn't look dead to me.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie looks as though the sight of Julian is going to make her cry, and she scowls at his body]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: His body's been preserved with magic.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She scowls at Julian's body, and after a moment, she spits angrily onto him before taking her tank of gasoline and soaking his body with it while Damon and Stefan watch]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Lot better-looking than our old man, I'll give Mom that.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>Move</i>. Unless you want to burn to a crisp alongside of him.

</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian's body is instantly set ablaze, but after a moment, the fire goes out with a whoosh, causing Valerie to frown in confusion before raising her hands again]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[chants] Incendia.</i>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[This time, the spell doesn't even work. Valerie looks horrified, but Stefan and Damon are just confused]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Should we, uh... get a match?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[horrified]</i> I don't understand.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Mary Louise and Nora appear in front of them, revealing that they concealed themselves with a cloaking spell and interfered with Valerie's spell. They smirk at the three of them in satisfaction]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> Well, of course. Guess it ain't a party until the mean girls show up.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Look who's in a <i>heap</i> of trouble!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: What's Lily going to say?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[smiles]</i> Let's ask her.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise raises her voice, calling out to Lily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Lily, we found Valerie! She's over here trying to kill the love of your life.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[At the sound of this statement, a furious Lily walks into the warehouse, with a similarly angry Beau at her side. Valerie looks terrified by the sight of her]</i>
</p><p><br/>
<i>[After the break, the scene returns to the warehouse, where she's staring longingly at Julian's body. After a moment, she closes the coffin lid and looks up at Nora and Mary Louise]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Girls, I'll meet you in the car. I need a moment with Valerie.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise and Nora leave, smirking at Valerie as they do so, as Lily walks toward Valerie until they're face to face]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: You may have stolen Oscar's phone, but you left something behind in his pocket.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie only becomes more scared as Lily holds up a hold ring, which she twists around her index fingertip]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Oscar always did covet Julian's ring. Beau found him easily with a locator spell.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily continues to stare at Valerie for a moment before continuing]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Why would you do this?
</dd></dl>

</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Lily, he's a <i>monster</i>! Bringing him back will only make things worse.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: So you go behind my back with my own <i>sons</i> to destroy him?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: It's not like you listen to me! You were so blinded by your love for him, it's like no one else exists.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily is so infuriated by these words that she slaps Valerie hard across the face, leaving Valerie reeling. Stefan, feeling badly for her, steps in to defend her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hey, we get it. You're angry.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily turns to look at Stefan as Valerie recovers from Lily's hit, tears spilling from her eyes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Whatever lies Valerie told you, that's <i>all</i> they are.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie backs away from her as she starts to cry, and Damon pipes up with a sarcastic comment, walking toward Lily until he's standing in front of Valerie in an almost protective stance]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Technically, she's been a bit vague on the details... I mean, mass-murderer, homicidal maniac, and typical, run-of-the-mill bad-guy stuff... But, before we just hand him over, you mind telling us what we're missing here? Who is this, <i>really</i>?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[softly]</i> This man is the love of my life. The man I didn't think I deserved. The one I fought for, waited for. The one I told myself I could change for. He makes me better, Damon.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily gives him a significant look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: You know anything about that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: A thing or two.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[coldly]</i> Then we are through her. Beau?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Beau walks toward Lily and the coffin, and when Valerie frantically tries to stop him, he angrily yanks his arm out of her grip and continues toward the coffin so he can take it and load it in their car]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[desperately]</i> No! Please, don't! He'll ruin us! He...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Beau ignores her and wheels the coffin out of the warehouse, and when Damon and Stefan do nothing to stop him, she turns toward them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: She's playing you! He didn't make her better-- if anything, he made her vindictive and cruel!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[frowns]</i> What's that supposed to mean?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Who do you think gave Kai the idea to put Elena in that <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>-coma?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily's face becomes stone-cold as Damon stares at Valerie in confusion]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>Who</i>?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Lily.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie moves to stand next to Stefan, and Damon stares at Lily in horror as she scowls at them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Is that true?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: She wanted to make you pay for refusing to help rescue us from the prison world.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, furious, growls threateningly before he vamp-speeds toward Lily and grabs her in a choke-hold]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Screw Julian! I'll kill <i>you</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Beau returns to the warehouse and flings his hand forward, causing Damon to be thrown backward into one of the shelves of coffins. Valerie spins around in horror and stares at Beau as Damon stands to his feet. He's just about to lunge for Beau angrily when Beau crouches down and spreads his arms wide before thrusting them together as though he's about to clap, which causes all of the coffins around them to explode in a shower of wooden shards]</i>

<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[incredulously]</i> Spelling the door? I thought you were leading us to a secret passage.

<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[gives him a look]</i> You watch too much <i>Scooby-Doo</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Outside in the hall, Oscar is heard slamming himself against the door, causing them both to panic]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Maybe he'll tire himself out, and we just go out the front door?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Or, I could just jump out that window while you fend for yourself.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo walks toward the window, but Bonnie grabs him by the arm to stop him, holding out her free hand as she looks at him expectantly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: First, give me that stone back.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: First, tell me why it's so special!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[sighs]</i> It's some kind of trap for a bunch of souls. If Lily wants it, someone she cares about must be inside.

</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Julian.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[rolls her eyes]</i> Great. Because we need another Heretic running loose around here.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: He's not a Heretic. He's a long-lost vampire boyfriend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Then you <i>definitely</i> don't need it. Do you really want to hand her the means to bring the dead boyfriend back into the picture? Have some <i>dignity</i>!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[As they fight, Oscar continues to slam his body against the door, and the loud banging noise causes Bonnie to flinch in fear]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: What makes you think I want romantic advice from a love-lorn witch?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I'm just saying-- maybe you deserve better.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Before Enzo can come up with a retort to this comment, a thrumming noise is heard from outside the door, and Enzo's eyes widen in alarm]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Bad news-- I think Oscar just learned how to siphon.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, Oscar bursts into the room and vamp-speeds toward Bonnie, pinning her against the wall in a choke-hold]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OSCAR: <i>[angrily]</i> Where is it? Where's the stone?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="BONNIE_AND_CAROLINE.27S_DORM_ROOM"> BONNIE AND CAROLINE'S DORM ROOM </span></h2>
<p><i>[Caroline, who is finishing getting ready for her date in her DORM ROOM, calls Stefan to get an update on their plans. Stefan is at the LOCKWOOD MANSION with Valerie, who is pretending not to eavesdrop on their conversation]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Hey, not to be a pessimist, but how late do you think you're actually gonna be? Should I move the reservation to nine o'clock, or...?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan, who still seems overwhelmed by what Valerie confessed to him earlier, does his best to sound okay, but still sounds anxious when he replies]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: ...I'm actually still in Mystic Falls.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline looks sad, but not very surprised by this answer]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: ...Or tommorrow, or next week?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan's face looks guilty about doing this to Caroline]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I'm sorry.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline pretends as though she's not disappointed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: It's okay!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Things got... complicated.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[sympathetically]</i> I know. Bonnie told me how the stone actually works. Alaric must be <i>devastated</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[awkwardly]</i> I'm sure he is. Um, hey. Listen-- I promise I'll... I'll make tonight up to you, okay?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline seems worried by the tone of Stefan's voice]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Is... Is there anything else monumental I should know about?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan's expression looks even more guilty as he lies to Caroline in answer]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: No. No, nothing. I'll see you tomorrow?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[disappointedly]</i> Okay. Um, I'll see you tomorrow.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Bye.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[They hang up the phone]</i>

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="LOCKWOOD_MANSION_.2F_SALVATORE_BOARDING_HOUSE_.2F_MYSTIC_GRILL"> LOCKWOOD MANSION / SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE / MYSTIC GRILL </span></h2>
<p><i>[After Stefan hangs up the phone at the LOCKWOOD MANSION, Valerie hesitantly walks toward him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: You didn't say a word the whole way back.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I didn't really know what to say.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[anxiously]</i> Uh, can you give me an overview of the options?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[sighs]</i> I'm angry that I didn't know. I'm sad that something I could have had was taken away from me. I want to kill Julian for what he did to you. And, I'm sorry that you had to go through this alone.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie seems slightly comforted by this response, but her voice is shaky when she speaks]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: After it happened, I wanted to die. I <i>did</i> die. I took my own life. I obviously didn't realize I had vampire blood in my system...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan seems shocked by this second confession from Valerie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: That's how you became a vampire? You killed yourself?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[laughs nervously]</i> Far cry from the girl you met at the fair, isn't it? It's funny how one event can change the outcome of your entire life.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan continues to stare at her with wide eyes as he processes all of the new information he has learned today, so Valerie gives him a moment before she speaks again]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Please don't tell anyone. I couldn't bear for Lily to know.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I won't. I promise.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Okay.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie hesitates awkwardly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I don't presume to know you now, or even what you wanted back then, but...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[cuts her off]</i> Yes. Would I have wanted a child? Yes.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie looks surprised by this answer, and they stand in uncomfortable silence for a long moment]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Look, we have, um, five guest rooms. You should probably stay the night.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[sighs]</i> No. I should run as far and fast as I can.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[shakes his head]</i> Damon won't let Lily get her hands on that stone. And, if she does, I will kill Julian myself.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
<i>[At the SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE, Mary Louise, Nora, Beau and Lily are standing around the dining room table, where Julian's body has been laid on top of it. His shirt is off, and the Phoenix Stone is resting right over Julian's heart. On his left pectoral muscle, there is a thick scar in the shape of an X, just like the one on Beau's collarbone and on Stefan's chest in the flash-forwards. Beau, Nora, and Mary Louise have their hands out over Julian's body, and the girls are chanting the incantation for the spell to resuscitate him while Beau gently mouths the words, unable to actually speak them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA &amp; MARY LOUISE: <i>[chants] Ababbas dagoineh mateesah elunatan. Julisan melunaweh washaset. Ababbas dagoineh mateesah elunatan. Julisan melunaweh washaset. Ababbas dagoineh mateesah...</i>
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
<i>[At the MYSTIC GRILL, Damon has joined Bonnie at the bar, where they're drinking more bourbon and discussing what they've learned that day]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[stunned]</i> So Lily is the reason I'll never see Elena again.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[depressed]</i> Apparently, she has a thing for emotional torture.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[offended]</i> Hey! I do <i>not</i> go behind people's back and torture them! I like my enemies to look me in the eye and see the depth of my rage.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon chuckles bitterly, but Bonnie looks at him with concern]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: You sure you wanna do this?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Burning that bastard's body would've been too good for Lily.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[At the SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE, Nora, Mary Louise, and Beau continue the spell to resurrect Julian. The bubbles in the Phoenix Stone start to move around inside of it, and Beau slowly moves one hand from side to side as if to direct Julian's spirit]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA &amp; MARY LOUISE: <i>[chants] Ababbas dagoineh mateesah elunatan. Julisan melunaweh washaset. Ababbas dagoineh mateesah elunatan. Julisan melunaweh washaset. Ababbas dagoineh mateesah elunatan...</i>
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[At the MYSTIC GRILL, Damon and Bonnie continue their conversation]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I want to give her that man she's cherished and loved and missed for a hundred years.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[At the SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE, the spell continues]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA &amp; MARY LOUISE: <i>[chants] Julisan melunaweh washaset. Ababbas dagoineh mateesah elunatan...</i>
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[At the MYSTIC GRILL, Bonnie and Damon continue to talk]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I want her to run into Julian's arms, and I want her to remember what it feels like to have him returned. I want her to taste <i>true happiness</i>...
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[At the SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE, the spell continues]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA &amp; MARY LOUISE: <i>[chants] Ababbas dagoineh mateesah elunatan. Julisan melunaweh washaset. Ababbas dagoineh mateesah elunatan. Julisan melunaweh washaset. Ababbas dagoineh mateesah elunatan. Julisan melunaweh washaset</i>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[All of the lit candles in the room, along with the fire in the fireplace, start to burst into even larger flames, and sparks shower down on them from the overhead lights. The tiny bubbles inside the Phoenix Stone spin rapidly in a spiral until suddenly, Julian's eyes flick open, revealing the same kaleidoscope effect of the stone in his irises for a moment before they return to normal. The flames all die down, and the lights shut off, causing Mary Louise, Nora, and Beau to open their eyes and find Julian awake on the table. He gasps in shock and sits up on his elbows, looking frantically around the room as a teary-eyed Lily rushes over to him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Julian, is it you?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian's eyes widen in surprise as he turns to see her face, and he laughs happily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Lily? Darling!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily is so relieved she rushes closer to him, allowing him to run his hand through her hair as he cups the back of her head and embraces her. Mary Louise and Nora look happy to see him well, and he and Lily to laugh euphorically before they begin to kiss passionately]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[At the MYSTIC GRILL, Bonnie and Damon are still talking]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: And then, I want to rip his head off right in front of her. I want to break her heart. I want to break her spirit. I want to <i>destroy</i> her.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie looks at him and smirks in amusement]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: So much for that new leaf, huh?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sighs]</i> Tell me I'm being stupid and reckless and cruel. Tell me I'm not doing right by Elena.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie smiles at him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: You're doing right by Elena.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[At these words, Damon smiles brightly at her and holds up his drink as a toast]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, glad to see you boarding this train to Crazytown, Bonnie Bennett! I was getting lonely all by myself.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie smiles back at him, and the two drink their bourbon as a toast to their friendship]</i>
