<p><i>[Stefan (still in Marty Hammond's body) is unconscious in Damon's Camaro as Damon drives and eats one of the doughnuts he brought for his brother. After a moment, he becomes concerned that he's still unconscious and holds his hand in front of his mouth and nose to make sure he's breathing. When he finds that he's still alive, he tries to rouse him awake]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Stefan? Hey, Stefan.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Finally, Damon pokes him in the face with his hand, and Stefan/Marty groans as he comes to]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What happened?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, I pulled your ass out of the snow, you ate a bunch of doughnuts, and then puked blood all over my nice, clean car.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan/Marty looks down at his lap, which is covered in bloody napkins]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You said "everything hurt," so...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon pulls out a grocery bag of over-the-counter medication and plops it on Stefan/Marty's lap]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Head stuff, throat stuff, stomach stuff...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan/Marty groans again, visibly ill and generally miserable-looking]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Where are we?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: On our way to Memphis. Valerie got a line on your <i>real</i> body-- the one with the nice hair.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[exasperatedly]</i> How did my real body end up in Memphis?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[hesitates]</i> You know what? Long story. How about you just focus on staying alive, okay? Sit back, relax, find your happy place... Chug one of those five-hour energy things, maybe with a cough syrup chaser or something?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Stefan starts to retch, and reflexively holds up the back of medicine just in time to throw up a significant amount of blood inside of it. Damon is both frustrated and grossed out by this development to the point that they're both groaning]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Aw... Okay. Plan B.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon pushes down the gas and speeds down the street before pulling over so quickly his tires screech]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[groans]</i> What are you doing?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon pulls out his phone and dials a number. After a few rings, an emergency dispatcher answers]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OPERATOR: <i>[on the phone] 911. What is your emergency?</i>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan/Marty gives Damon a desperate look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Damon, I can't go to a hospital! Marty Hammond got loaded and crashed a bus full of kids. There's an interstate manhunt going on.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon smiles at his brother reassuringly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Don't worry, brother. I'm not taking you to a hospital-- I'm bringing the hospital to us!
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ARKANSAS_HOSPITAL"> ARKANSAS HOSPITAL </span></h2>
<p><i>[Alaric has just driven into the parking lot of a hospital in his old SUV, where he gets out and walks toward an ambulance in the bay. Just then, the back doors of the ambulance open, and Damon smiles and hops out at the sight of Alaric. Behind him, two (presumably compelled) paramedics are assessing Stefan/Marty's condition, and when Alaric sees them, he gives Damon an exasperated look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I had to improvise! The over-the-counter stuff wasn't working.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon turns to point at the paramedics behind him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: That's Frank, and that's Sully.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> FRANK: Hi, guys
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> SULLY: Hey, how you doin'?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I've asked them very politely to make sure that Marty stays alive, and if he doesn't, then I will cut their thumbs off and feed them to the squirrels. Right, guys?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon turns back for confirmation, and Frank and Sully roll their eyes before giving him double thumbs-up before he turns back to Alaric]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Meanwhile, you and I will go hunt down the sociopath that has taken residence in my brother, and then Valerie will jam his soul back... in...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon frowns and narrows his eyes at Alaric when he realizes what (or who) is missing]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Where's my witch?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> She's at a motel off Route 70, prepping for the spell.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[confused]</i> Prepping for the spell? What does that even mean? What could she possibly have to prep?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[sighs]</i> I guess it's a little more complicated than that. At any rate, she managed to do a locator spell on the serial killer in Stefan's body. His name's Ambrose. Turns out, he's holed up in a frat house near Memphis College.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[nods]</i> Maybe he'll be so busy snacking on drunk sorority girls that this'll be an easy snatch-and-grab?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon starts to walk toward the Camaro while the paramedics continue to treat Stefan/Marty in the ambulance]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Listen, thanks for coming all this way to help out, buddy. Means a lot.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[sarcastically]</i> Yeah, well, I didn't exactly volunteer, Damon. Valerie sort of ambushed me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[shrugs]</i> Well, you know, she probably thought you'd feel good about stepping up for an old friend. Especially since you're planning on marrying his ex...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric gives Damon a look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: You sure this is how you want to play it, Damon? You know, maybe you bought Marty an hour or so, but when the same thing happened to Jo... I don't know, maybe you want to consider spending your remaining time just... being with your brother.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> Did you <i>seriously</i> just suggest that I spend the afternoon saying a sappy goodbye to Stefan instead of saving his life? Getting soft, Ric. More than soft-- your brain has <i>liquefied</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon starts to head toward his car]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Get in.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="MENTAL_HEALTH_CENTER--_ASHVILLE.2C_NORTH_CAROLINA"> MENTAL HEALTH CENTER-- ASHVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA </span></h2>
<p><i>[Bonnie, who is still in the mental health hospital, is in the middle of a group therapy session and is talking about her feelings regarding her friendship with Damon]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Thing is, I cared about him more than anyone else in the world... But it wasn't enough. I mean, he walked away like it was the easiest thing in the world to do. Then, I find out he's back and hasn't bothered to contact me. I think, "How could I have fallen into such a dark place over someone who cares so little about me?"
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[A woman who is older than Bonnie and who is sitting across from her at the circle watches her speak with a curious expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I've decided I'm ready to move on. I'm not gonna let that betrayal define the rest of my life.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> COUNSELOR: Thank you, Bonnie. Nice progress.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The counselor turns toward the woman seated across from Bonnie, who is still staring intently at her. Bonnie starts to look uncomfortable and confused by this attention]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> COUNSELOR: Virginia? Did you have something you wanted to share?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Virginia just rolls her eyes, though her gaze does not stray from Bonnie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VIRGINIA: No.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie continues to stare back at Virginia with an uneasy expression]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ON_THE_ROAD_TO_MEMPHIS"> ON THE ROAD TO MEMPHIS </span></h2>
<p><i>[Damon is driving the Camaro as he tries to get information from Alaric, who is sitting in the passenger seat]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: So, what'd I miss when I was gone? What's been happening?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[shrugs]</i> Wouldn't know.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> Oh, come on. Maybe <i>you</i> buried your head in a Dallas sandbox, but your wife-to-be? She's <i>always</i> in everyone's business. Which is why I find it hard to believe that she wouldn't drop some details about her best friend over string cheese and chicken nuggets.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[sighs]</i> Look, Damon, if you're fishing for information about Bonnie, I suggest you go straight to the source.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I totally would, but she didn't leave a forwarding address with my storage unit. Ah, it doesn't matter. It'll give Care-bear and I something to talk about at the reception.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[chuckles]</i> Yeah, well, we're not actually having a big wedding thing. Just a few friends.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon makes a face at him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Since when do you have friends besides me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[exasperatedly]</i> We made new ones. Look, I know this has been just a cat-nap for you, Damon, but it's been <i>three years</i> in the real world. People change. Life goes on.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[offended]</i> It wasn't a cat-nap, Ric. I made an <i>excruciatingly painful</i> descent into a near-death state so I wouldn't destroy everyone that I loved.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[sighs]</i> You know what? Now that we know where Ambrose is all camped out, I think I'm going to go back to my life, now. So, if you don't mind taking me to the airport, or a train station, or... even this bus stop here... Yeah, if you want to pull over...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: And <i>there</i> it goes. Look, I get you're mad, okay? I shouldn't have said goodbye in a letter. I should've flown to Dallas, and taken you out for drinks and line-dancing, and told you face-to-face. I'm very sorry, Ric. Just let me make it up to you, huh?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Oh, you know, Damon, I'm really not interested in being part of your 12-step redemption tour.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: One more mission, for old time's sake, huh? I can assure you that saving my little brother will be <i>much</i> more fun than putting together old broken-up baby dolls.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[annoyed]</i> Yeah, well, I'm not really a big fan of your brother right now, either. He broke Caroline's heart when he abandoned her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Worked out pretty well for <i>you</i>, didn't it?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric, confused, makes a face at him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Huh?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[smirks]</i> Oh, come on! Help me out. Be a hero. I mean, unless you don't think Caroline cares whether Stefan lives or dies...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Ric gives him an exasperated look as though to say, "Seriously?", but when Damon just smiles brightly at him, he sighs in defeat]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ARKANSAS_HOSPITAL_2"> ARKANSAS HOSPITAL </span></h2>
<p><i>[Stefan/Marty is still in the ambulance outside of the hospital, where he has an oxygen mask over his face and is fading in and out of consciousness while the paramedics keep an eye on him. After a moment, his eyes flutter closed, and he is transported into a flashback]</i>
</p><p><b>THE PHILIPPINES-- TWO YEARS AGO (2014)</b>
</p><p><i>[Stefan, looking a little glum, is sitting alone at the tropical-themed bar from the flashbacks in <a href="/wiki/Days_of_Future_Past/Transcript" title="Days of Future Past/Transcript">Days of Future Past</a>, clicking a pen in his hand while deep in thought. After a moment, the bartender starts to talk to him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BARTENDER: Where's your girl tonight?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[confused]</i> My girl?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BARTENDER: Valerie? Tall, pretty, likes the drinks with the little pink umbrellas? Or do you have more than one?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Oh! No, no, no. Just... just one.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The bartender notices the pen in his hand and the paper in front of him on the bar and gets a curious look on his face]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BARTENDER: Need any help? What are you trying to write?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[sighs]</i> An apology.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The bartender looks at the letter and reads it aloud]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BARTENDER: "I wish that things were different, but it's safer this way. Never meant to hurt you, and I wish you all the happiness in the world." Well, sounds good to me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: She returns all of them unopened. Maybe this is the one she'll read.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BARTENDER: <i>[nods]</i> Right.

<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>

</p>
<dl><dd> FRANK: Everything okay, buddy?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Do you have a piece of paper and a pen? I need to write a letter... in case I don't make it out of this.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ALPHA_RHO_TAU_FRATERNITY_HOUSE--_MEMPHIS_COLLEGE.2C_MEMPHIS.2C_TENNESSEE"> ALPHA RHO TAU FRATERNITY HOUSE-- MEMPHIS COLLEGE, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Ambrose, who is still in Stefan's body, is doing the vampire version of a keg-stand-- he feeds off of the human who is upside down and chugging beer from the keg as the rest of the (presumably compelled) fraternity brothers and their guests chant and encourage them to keep going]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CROWD: <i>[chants]</i> Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The crowd cheers as Ambrose/Stefan pulls away, blood smeared across his mouth, and sighs in pleasure as the crowd cheers. Just then, Damon appears on the front step and forcefully kicks the door open, causing the bent fireplace poker locking the doors to clatter aside as everyone, Ambrose included, turns to see the cause of the racket. Ambrose seems very amused to see Damon standing there]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMBROSE: Damon! I was wondering if you'd show up. Come in, friend. Have a drink!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon is about to stomp through the door when he's stopped at the threshold, having not been invited in by one of the fraternity brothers who lives at the house]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMBROSE: Oh, dear. Looks like you're a pledge who didn't make the cut! I guess now you'll just have to slog through a bit of old-fashioned hazing.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon sighs in annoyance and scowls at him]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[After the break, Damon has walked back to the car with what looks like an Alpha Rho Tau t-shirt in his hands, where he finds a still-annoyed Alaric waiting for him as he slides into the driver's seat]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Okay, so... I couldn't get past the threshold. You're on deck.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He tosses Alaric the tshirt]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Got you a disguise. Here, put that on. You can go as the... uh... creepy professor pretending to be a chaperone.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric gives Damon a look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: I booked a 5:15 into Dallas/Fort Worth. Even used my miles!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon scoffs and rolls his eyes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You're not fooling anyone, Ric. You know that? You leveled a rifle on me when I showed up at your house. I know you're still in the game.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[exasperatedly]</i> I'm not in the game because I possess the means to protect my family from some uninvited lurker.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[impatiently]</i> It's my brother's life we're talking about here, Ric! If you're not gonna do it for <i>me</i>, at least do it for the guy who stepped aside and made this perfect, happy life that you're just <i>dying</i> to get back to possible.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric gives him another exasperated look, but before either of them can say another word, a young woman approaches the car and knocks on the window. Damon reluctantly rolls it down to speak with her and looks at her with confusion]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yeah?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> WOMAN: Are you Damon Salvatore?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[warily]</i> Well, that depends on who's asking...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She holds up a phone, which has just started to ring, and hands it to him through the window]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> WOMAN: He said if you don't answer this, I'm supposed to run into traffic.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric is visibly unhappy by this development, and Damon looks pretty appalled as well]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'm answering.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He takes the phone and hits the "answer" button before putting it up to his ear to speak with Ambrose. The woman, content knowing her fate is secure, walks away]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[on the phone]</i> So, I hear your vampire MO is payback for you being a Greek system reject. Kind of cliché, don't you think?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon shoots Alaric an annoyed look before opening the driver's side door and getting out so he can take a walk while they talk]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMBROSE: Why don't you come on back here, Damon? I'm sure I can remember which attractive, over-privileged parasite owns this place.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Huh. Well, the only parasite I'm interested in is you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[While they talk, Ambrose walks up the stairs of the frat house, where the party is still raging hard despite the fact that it's now daytime, and takes in the sight of everyone dancing and drinking]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMBROSE: You know, I don't actually care much for the taste of blood. What I <i>do</i> love are the less-obvious perks. Eavesdropping skills, mind games... Of course, it's fun to wantonly murder these class-obsessed imbeciles, but making them kill each other? Oh, that really takes the egg.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sighs]</i> This is all fascinating. Really. Here's the thing-- I can't hear you that well. I don't think the reception's that good in there. Why don't you just come out and deliver your villainous monologue face-to-face? What do you think?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> AMBROSE: Look, Damon, I know you won't leave me alone until you get your brother's body. So, why don't you do me one small favor, and we'll both get what we want?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Ambrose/Stefan takes an empty wine bottle and smashes the end of it on the edge of the bar upstairs. Damon is clearly tempted by this offer, though he seems to know nothing good will come from it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: ...How small?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> AMBROSE: Rayna Cruz. She chased me across this country for a decade. Made my life hell-- <i>literally</i>. Yours, too, I hear.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: What about her?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[As Ambrose replies, he uses the sharp edge of the now-broken bottle to slit his wrist before draining his blood into an empty red Solo cup]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMBROSE: Well, let's just say I made things personal with her. Framed her for a couple of massacres...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Ambrose sighs dramatically before he continues]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMBROSE: Turned her boyfriend. She won't be satisfied until I'm dead. In fact, she's probably on her way over here right now. So, why don't you go ahead and kill her for me, and I promise I will turn your brother's body over to you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Ambrose walks over to a nearby frat brother and hands him the cup of his blood with a smile, which the young man then drinks without question]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[skeptically]</i> And <i>why</i> would you do that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> AMBROSE: Oh. Clearly, you are not familiar with the loophole. Well, I can easily jump into the body of a transitioning vampire...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Ambrose rears his arm back before using the broken bottle to slit the throat of the frat boy who just drank his blood, killing him nearly instantly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMBROSE: All you need to do is find me a witch who can soul-swap me into the body of a fellow you don't care about, and Stefan can have his body back. I, in turn, can mount Rayna Cruz's head on my wall. Everyone wins. What do you say, Damon?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon nods, realizing this is his best option]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Consider it done.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> AMBROSE: <i>[cheerfully]</i> Wonderful!
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WILDWOOD_MOTEL"> WILDWOOD MOTEL </span></h2>

</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: How's Stefan?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, old Marty's heart's still beating, thanks to the miracle of modern medicine. I'm now sending him to the beautiful Wildwood Motel in a big red truck. Little sirens on the top, white stripe on the side-- you can't miss it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[impatiently]</i> And what about Ambrose? What is taking so long?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon scoffs in offense at her remark]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hey, I'm out here busting my ass trying to catch this candy shell of a man that you love. You're the one holed up in the motel, eating vending machine crackers, so just give me a break, okay?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie looks extremely stressed out about this situation]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Gemini spells usually take <i>two</i> witches, Damon. I'm trying to gather the strength to ensure that I can actually get him back into his own body.

<p><i>[Damon rolls his eyes as he blows the lit can out, and Ambrose scowls at him angrily before grabbing a nearby plank of wood and using his knee to break it in half]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> AMBROSE: On the contrary-- the fun's just begun.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Ambrose lunges toward Damon to stake him as Damon just smirks smugly. Before Ambrose can get close to him, he's shot in the back with a vervain dart and is instantly knocked out. When he collapses onto the ground, it is revealed that Alaric is standing behind him and was the one who shot him, and it's clear by the look on his face that he's enjoying himself, which makes Damon happy]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: I hate how good that felt.

<p><i>[In Bonnie's bathroom, Bonnie has just taken the cup of Rayna's blood pills, which is actually the handle on the faucet of her sink, and replaced it so that she can keep them hidden before she turns back to Virginia, who is standing in the doorway]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Now tell me why the Armory is looking for me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VIRGINIA: You <i>also</i> promised to get me out of this place, remember? Do you have a key code or something?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I have a doctor who can check us both out, but not before you tell me what I need to know.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie stares Virginia in the eyes, and Virginia takes a shaky deep breath, clearly scared by whatever she is about to tell her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VIRGINIA: There's a vault in the basement of the Armory. It was sealed by a Bennett witch a long time ago, and only a Bennett witch can unlock it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[confused]</i> So they want me to open a vault?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VIRGINIA: As far as my family knew, Lucy Bennett was the only living witch in your line, but she disappeared about four years ago. I'm not sure why we didn't know about you...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I was officially dead for a while. Then I wasn't.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Virginia frowns in confusion, and Bonnie shrugs]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: It was a long story. What's in this vault?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Virginia's voice shakes with fear when she replies]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VIRGINIA: Something that <i>can't</i> be let out.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[impatiently]</i> Gonna need to you be a little more specific.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VIRGINIA: First, you have to sweat that you'll <i>never</i> open it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[A tear falls down Virginia's cheek from the fear of what is inside the vault, but Bonnie isn't swayed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: If this vault is the key to my freedom, I can't promise you anything until I know what's in it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Virginia looks sad and disappointed as more tears fall down her cheeks, and she smiles weakly before turning away and wiping the tears off of her face]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VIRGINIA: Oh... I was hoping you'd be... on my side.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She suddenly grabs the toothbrush cup on the sink and uses it to smash the mirror over it before grabbing a large shard of glass and wielding it as a weapon. Bonnie backs away and looks at her in horror]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: What are you doing?!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VIRGINIA: Sorry. I <i>can't</i> let you open the vault.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She swipes at Bonnie several times, cutting her on the bicep twice and causing Bonnie to call out in pain]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: AHH! OW!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The sound of Bonnie's cries alerts the orderlies, who rush into the room. When they see the injured Bonnie being physically threatened by Virginia, one of the male orderlies grabs Virginia and disarms her before using his arms to restrain her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VIRGINIA: Let me go! Let me go! She's a witch! She's trying to break out! You have to stop her. Please!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Another orderly rushes around with a syringe full of sedative and injects Virginia in the arm with it, and though she continues to struggle against their hold, she quickly weakens as she starts to fall asleep]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VIRGINIA: You have to stop her! She can't open that vault! She can't open... the vault...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Once Virginia is unconscious, one of the orderlies carries her out to take her back to her room, leaving the other orderly to check on Bonnie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ORDERLY: You alright, Miss McCullough?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie, who is clearly still shaken by this turn of events, is distracted for a moment before she finally nods weakly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Yeah.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The orderly leaves to go tend to his other patients, leaving a still-concerned Bonnie behind in her room]</i>

<p><i>[Ambrose, still unconscious and in Stefan's body, is laying on one of the beds in Valerie's motel room while Stefan is barely conscious in Marty's body and laying in the other. Valerie sits between the two beds, surrounded by dozens of white candles, as she takes Stefan/Marty's hand in her own and looks at him with affection, though it's clear Marty is in bad shape. All the while, Alaric watches from behind her, looking conflicted about this situation]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I'll get you back to where you belong. Don't worry.

<p><i>[Valerie looks back at Alaric with a grateful expression]</i>
</p>

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Snagged this from the front desk, in case we have to restart Marty's ticker.

</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Damon's the one you should be thanking.

A fire is roaring in the fireplace, and Valerie is by the bar, where she smiles and reaches for a bottle of bourbon. It soon becomes clear that Valerie is using her vampire telepathy to enter Stefan's mind to comfort him while she does the spell in the real world]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Care for a drink?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan sits up and looks around in confusion as Valerie pours them drinks]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What am I doing here?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Well, you know what they say-- "There's no place like home."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You're in my head, aren't you?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie rolls her eyes good-naturedly as she joins Stefan on the couch and hands him a drink]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: No matter where we traveled, you were always going on and on about how much you missed this musty old house. I figured you'd be more comfortable here, and I wanted to see the real you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Do I even want to know what's happening out there?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: You're going to be <i>fine</i>. Promise.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie leans forward and kisses him, but when they pull away, Stefan makes a suspicious face]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You wouldn't happen to be lying to me, would you? Because if I'm about to die a painful death in a strange human's body, then I want to make the most of my time.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: The only thing you need to worry about is our next destination. Any ideas? Or would you rather spin the old globe in the upstairs study and let fate decide?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Well... I've actually had a lot of time to think lately.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I suppose there's something about standing on the precipice of death that lends itself to deep thoughts.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: And I wouldn't have to run anymore. I wouldn't have the scar. My life wouldn't be tied to Rayna's.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Well, we wouldn't have to call it "running." We could call it "sightseeing".
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Or, we could stay closer to home.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: "Home?" You do remember we can't go back to Mystic Falls, right? Matt Donovan made sure of that.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie's smile falls slightly when she realizes where he may be going with this]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Unless you're talking about somewhere else... Dallas, maybe?
</dd></dl>

</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: No. Of course not.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: But things are different now. And you have a chance to go back to your real life.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[confused]</i> You <i>are</i> my real life.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[This response clearly touches Valerie deeply, and her eyes start to fill with tears, which does not escape Stefan's notice. However, his concern becomes even more serious when he sees that her nose is starting to bleed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Valerie? What's wrong?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[In the real world, Valerie is still working on the spell, but it's clear that it's starting to take its toll on her as her nose begins to bleed even more and pant for breath]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[chants] ...revertum corpus soelteros... mentum... mente...</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Valerie? Valerie, are you okay?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon joins Alaric in checking on her as she wheezes, looking even more frantic than Valerie herself as he puts his hands around her arms and holds her upright]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No, no, no! Hey, get up! Hey, you promised me. Get up. You promised you could do this. Get up! Valerie, get up!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie struggles to get up and finish the spell, but she's getting weaker by the moment, and her attempts to chant just come out as grunts and groans]</i>
</p><p><i>[Back in Stefan's mind, Stefan is looking at Valerie with just as much concern as he tries to get her to talk to him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Valerie, what's happening?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie weakly wipes the blood from her nose before looking at Stefan with a sad expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Be honest-- have I only been a pleasant distraction these past few years, or am I something more?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks taken aback and saddened by this question]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What? No, you've never been a distraction.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie becomes even weaker and slumps over, leading Stefan to finally realize what is happening]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Valerie! It's the spell. It's hurting you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan tries to keep Valerie upright]</i>
</p><p><i>[Meanwhile, in the real world, Damon is holding Valerie the exact same way as he continues to try to rouse her while Alaric watches anxiously]</i>

<dl><dd> DAMON: Valerie? Valerie, get up!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Damon, stop. She's not strong enough.

<p><i>[Damon turns back to Valerie, who is still barely conscious and hanging like a rag doll in Damon's arms]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hey, get up! You promised me you could do this!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie suddenly gasps awake, and though she's still weak, she's at least aware and alert enough to pick up where she left off as Damon takes her hands in his own and puts one each on Marty and Stefan. He continues to stand behind her with his arms bracing hers so she can stay upright as she kneels on the floor between them]</i>

<p><i>[In Stefan's head, Stefan is looking at Valerie in horror in fear when he realizes she's still doing the spell]</i>

<dl><dd> STEFAN: Valerie, stop the spell right now! It's too strong for you. It's <i>killing</i> you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[determinedly]</i> No.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[panicked]</i> Valerie, stop it!

<dl><dd> VALERIE: I have <i>no</i> intention of breaking that promise.

<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[pleadingly]</i> Valerie, <i>please</i>! Please, stop.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[seriously]</i> You're all I have.

<p><i>[Valerie closes her eyes to continue the spell as Stefan becomes overwhelmed with fear]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Valerie, stop the spell!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan is horrified when suddenly, Valerie slips out of his hold and completely vanishes, causing him to look around the now-empty parlor in confusion and panic]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Valerie? Valerie?!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The parlor starts to glow white as Stefan stands to his feet, until suddenly, he awakens with a gasp in the bed in Valerie's motel room to find Valerie kneeling on the floor beside his bed, who stares at Stefan in shock, along with Damon and Alaric, who aren't sure what to think]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[hesitantly]</i> Stefan?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: It's me. It's me.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan manages to pull himself into a halfway-seated position so that he's close enough to pull Valerie closer to him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: It's me.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan pulls her into an embrace and hugs her tightly, and both Damon and Alaric share a happy look as they sigh in relief. However, though Valerie still hugs him tightly, Stefan looks troubled by what has just occurred]</i>

<p><i>[Alaric ignores him and keeps walking]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Ric! Ric, come on, man. Where are you going?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric finally stops walking and turns to face him, and it is clear by the expression on his face and the tone of his voice that he's annoyed and his patience is wearing thin]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Home.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon's expression looks hurt as he sighs, visibly guilty about what he's done to their friendship]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Oh, Ric. I'm trying here, man. I am. I shouldn't have abandoned you. That was a terrible thing to do. I'm sorry. But just tell me whatever amends I need to make, or whatever bridges I need to build, and let's just... Let's just get back to the way things were. All right?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[sighs]</i> You want to know why the last three years have been the happiest of my life? Because I got to start over. Because I have two little girls that I absolutely love, a job that I actually earned, and a fiancée that makes me feel <i>so</i> lucky to be alive. And I did all that without you barging into my life and screwing things up.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon is obviously devastated by this answer, though he knows that Alaric has made a valid point, and when Alaric sees the guilt and hurt in his expression, he sighs again, though only slightly guilty about his harsh words]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Damon, no offense, but I don't want things to go back to the way they were.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, overwhelmed by emotion and at a loss of what to do, just swallows anxiously and tries to cover up his hurt feelings]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well... Thanks for being honest.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric gives him a somewhat sympathetic look before turning to walk away, but after a moment, he grimaces before he reluctantly stops and turns around to make one last statement to Damon]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Bonnie's undercover in a psych ward in Ashville. You might have better luck winning her back.

</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Better.

<p><i>[Stefan only looks more confused by this answer]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Uh... I'm standing right here. You don't have to right me a letter.

<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[sighs]</i> I heard the fear in your voice. You weren't afraid of dying. You were afraid that I was going to die for you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[frowns]</i> Yeah, of course I was.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: You were afraid that it wouldn't have been worth it. Me sacrificing myself for you. Because you don't love me the way I love you... And the guilt of that sacrifice would eat you alive.

</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Valerie...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: The truth is... I've never loved anyone the way I love you. But that's not true for you. And now, by some miracle, you get the chance to go back and make things right with Caroline. I know you never meant to hurt me. I even know that you loved me in your own way. And maybe if things had been different, if the world had been kinder to us... I could've been the love of your life, too. Your small, quiet human life.

<dl><dd> VALERIE: Don't be. I think it will be good for me, to find a new life that's completely my own. I've never had that.

Enzo spins her around in a circle before leaning down to kiss her passionately. However, when they pull away, he frowns when he sees the bloody cut on her arm from where Virginia cut her with the shard of mirror. Bonnie responds in a flirtatious tone of voice]</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: I didn't-I didn't know, but the Armory was, was-was experimenting on Mary Louise. They forced these pills down her throat every day for the past three years, and as a result, she became very... very ill.

<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[confused]</i> I thought she blew herself up?
