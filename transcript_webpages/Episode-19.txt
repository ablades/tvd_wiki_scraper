 Mystic Falls High School 

[Stefan is parking his car. Elena sees him and joins him.]

Elena: Nice car.

Stefan: Thought it was a waste to leave it in the garage.

[She smiles, they kiss.]

Elena: I didn't know you were coming back today.

Stefan: You know, I woke up this morning and I was feeling great and I figured it was time for me to get back into things.

Elena: Does that mean you're okay now, with all the cravings?

Stefan: Yeah, I mean the worst part is over so...now all I want to do is just spend as much time with you as possible.

Elena: I'm okay with that.

[They kiss.]

Stefan: Hey, thank you for helping me get through the rough patch.

Elena: You're welcome (pause, they look each other). We're gonna be late.

Stefan: Okay, uh, you know what? I'll catch up with you, I'm gonna grab my stuff. I'll be right behind you.

Elena: Okay.

[She leaves; he goes to the trunk and opens it. There are a lot of blood bags from Mystic Falls Hospital. He grabs his stuff and closes the trunk.]

 Founders Hall 

[Damon, John and Sheriff Forbes are talking.]

Sheriff Forbes: There was a disturbance at the hospital blood bank last night; some of the supply was compromised.

Damon: Compromised? You mean stolen?

Sheriff Forbes: We almost missed it. The inventory records were altered but when the night manager was questioned he had no recollection of changing them.

John: Meaning that the vampire who stole the blood used mind control to hide the theft.

Damon (looking at John): I know what you meant.

Sheriff Forbes: We wouldn't have noticed had John not alerted us to recent discrepancies in other hospital blood banks in the county.

Damon: How lucky for us, we have John.

[He looks at John.]

Sheriff Forbes: We're stepping up security at the hospital, giving the guard vervain to prevent this from happening again.

John: Sheriff, may I offer a suggestion? Why don't Damon and I put our heads together? We can track down whoever is doing this.

Sheriff Forbes: Truthfully I can use the extra hands. Is that something you would be willing to do?

Damon: Well, of course, I mean if it'll help.

John: I think we could make a good team, don't you think Damon?

[He looks at Damon.]

Damon: John, whatever I can do to help keep this town safe; even if it means spending time with you.

[He looks at John and smiles, John smiles too.]

 Mystic Falls High School 

[Alaric's History Class.]

Alaric: Okay, this week we're gonna set outside our regular curriculum for a lesson in local history as we approach Founders' Day. Apparently the community leaders feels it's more important than World War 2 but hey what do I know?

[Bonnie interrupts him and enters the classroom.]

Bonnie: Sorry I'm late.

Alaric: Well, it looks like we will be at full occupancy today. Welcome home, Bonnie.

[Bonnie sits down and smiles at Elena but when she looks at Stefan her smile fades and. Stefan smiles at her but she tries not to look and him and turns her head. Elena and Stefan don't understand, they look at each other.]

 Salvatore Boarding House 

[Someone is ringing the bell, Damon opens the door: it's Anna.]

Damon: I suppose I should be grateful, you learned how to use the bell.

Anna: I'm here on behalf of my mother.

[She enters.]

Damon: On behalf of or in spite of?

Anna: I'm sorry about what the other vampires did to Stefan. Abducting him, torturing him...It wasn't supposed to go down like that.

Damon: You're playing house with half of a tomb of really pissed off vampires. What do you think was going to happen?

Anna: My mom is devastated; they tried to over throw her.

Damon: Why isn't she here telling me this?

Anna: She doesn't really do apologies.

Damon: Well, it's a coincidence, â€˜cause I don't do forgiveness. Just run along. And if you're going continue playing house with these little vampires pets, you might wanna stop robbing the blood bank dry because they're onto it.

Anna: I haven't been to the local blood bank in at least a week.

Damon: Then it's one of your others.

Anna: The others are gone, Damon.

Damon: Well, where did they go?

Anna: They weren't cut out for this town. After what happened with your brother my mom kicked them out and they took off. It's just us and Harper now.

 Mystic Falls High School 

[Bonnie is walking, reading papers; Elena is running after her.]

Elena: Bonnie!

Bonnie: Hey.

Elena: Hey, I tried to grab you after class but you already taken off. How are you? How's your family?

Bonnie: We're dealing, it's been hard.

Elena: Everyone here really missed you.

Bonnie: Yeah, I just had so much to deal with after Grams' funeral and, honestly after you told me the tomb spell failed I just didn't really want to come back.

Elena: I hope that you understand why I called...I wanted you to know before you came home.

Bonnie: I understand why. I just...shouldn't know.

[Long pause, they look at each other.]

Elena: I know it's been really hard...

[Caroline interrupts them.]

Caroline: Bonnie! Bonnie! Thank god you're home!

[She embraces Bonnie.]

Caroline: I know we talked everyday but I missed you.

[Elena seems upset.]

Caroline: How are you doing?

Bonnie: Better. Better. You know, glad to be back and trying to keep myself busy.

Caroline: Well, I can help with that. Major wardrobe problem. You need to help me pick up the perfect dress for the Founders' court.

Elena: The Founders' court? Did I miss something?

Caroline: The Founders' court! You know, Miss Mystic Falls. They announced it today and you and I are both on it.

Elena: Oh my god! We signed up for that so long ago...I completely forgot.

Caroline: So, are you dropping out then?

Elena: I can't.

[She looks at Bonnie.]

Caroline: No?

Bonnie: Her mom is the one who wanted her to enter.

 Salvatore Boarding House 

[Stefan is back from school. Damon walks up to him.]

Damon: How was school?

Stefan: Fine.

Damon: Yeah? Same old, same old? Nothing new? No stories to bring home?

Stefan: You're making small talk, why?

Damon: You seem awfully chipper lately, less doom and gloom, a little more pep in your step.

Stefan: And you think it's because I drank human blood again.

Damon: I don't want to brag but I would definitely take responsibility for this new and improved you.

Stefan: Well, I hate to burst your bubble but I'm clean.

Damon: Yeah, not possible.

Stefan: Not only isn't possible but it is quite true.

Damon: Stefan, just be serious for a second. You spent the last century and a half being a poster child for Prozac and now you expect me to believe that this new you has nothing to do with human blood. Nothing.

Stefan: I'm clean.

Damon: You're lying!

Stefan: Believe what you want.

[Stefan leaves, Damon seems suspicious.]

 Gilbert Residence/Salvatore Boarding House 

[Elena is in the kitchen. She opens the fridge and takes a bottle of water. She's on the phone with Stefan.]

Elena: I'm sorry for the short notice; I didn't even know that the contest was coming up much less that I would be in it.

Stefan: I will be happy to escort you anyway.

Elena: My mom was really into this Founders' day stuff. She was even Miss Mystic in her day. I kind of want to do it for her.

Stefan: It'll be great, we'll have fun.

Elena: Okay, I'll see you tomorrow, I love you.

Stefan: I love you too.

 Salvatore Boarding House 

[He hangs up. He has a blood pouch in his hands. He opens a drawer and hides the blood pouch in it. He goes in the basement and opens the fridge. There are a lot of blood pouches in it, he looks at it but Damon is looking at him in the shadow.]

Damon: Well well, he's a liar and a thief. So, when were you gonna share?

Stefan: Go ahead, help yourself.

Damon: No, no, no I'm talking about the fact that you're a closet blood junkie.

Stefan: So, I'm drinking blood again. You're the one that shoved it on me, what's your problem? I have it under control.

Damon: Under control? You robbed the hospital!

Stefan: So, what's your point?

Damon: Fine, whatever man, drink up. Just remember, we're trying to keep a low profile. Why don't you just walk up to Sheriff Forbes and ask her to tap a vein?

Stefan: Have my actions negatively impacted you? I can't imagine what that must feel like.

Damon: Yeah, what's Elena thinks about the new...you?

Stefan: Nothing's changed; I'm still the same person.

Damon: Clearly.

Stefan: Elena doesn't need to know anything yet.

Damon: You've been off the human stuff for years, Stefan. If you're having trouble controlling...

Stefan: I'm not having trouble.

Damon: Who do you think you're talking to? I know what it's like. That Jekyll and Hyde feeling, that switch, sometimes it goes off and you snap. Right now is not a good time for me to be worried about you snapping.

Stefan: I know that it pains you to see this but I'm fine, okay? I'm fine.

[He takes a pouch from the fridge.]

Stefan: So please, do me a favor and back off.

[He closes the fridge and leaves.]

 Founders Hall 

[Carol Lockwood and two others woman are interviewing the girls who are in the Miss Mystic Falls pageant.]

Carol: This year's queen will have the special honor of taking stage at the hundred and fiftieth Founders' Day Gala. Before we crown our winner, we'd like to get to know a bit more about each of you.

[The contestants speak in an inter-cut edit.]

Caroline: I'm on the Mystic Falls beautification committee; I volunteer at the poor soup kitchen.

Elena: I recognize that I haven't been as involved this year that I used to be.

Caroline: I implemented this year's go green campaign at school.

Elena: I've been distracted and I let a lot of things slide.

Girl: I don't think it's wrong for me to win two years in a row.

Amber: I was surprised to have been selected since I'm not from one of the founding families.

Elena: But I'm aware of what an honor this is and I want you to know that I take it seriously.

Caroline: I worked for the recycling program and was in charge of this year's police raffle.

Tina: Just because my D.U.I. made my community service mandatory doesn't mean that I was any less committed.

Elena: This was really important to my mother. She believed in community, family, honor and loyalty. It's the legacy she left for me.

 Salvatore Boarding House 

[Someone is ringing the bell, Damon opens the door it's John. He enters in the house.]

John: Hey partner!

Damon: What do you want?

John: You haven't return any of my calls.

Damon: Most people take that as a hint.

John: Where do we start looking for vampires?

Damon: How do you act John? You obviously don't care about catching vampires, you're here talking to me.

John: Actually, I care very much.

Damon: What Isobel say about that? I mean, considering that she is one.

John: Isobel and I share a mutual interest. The original Jonathan Gilbert has an invention that was stolen by a vampire. That vampire was then burned alive in Fell's church, or so Jonathan thought and the invention was lost forever. But then the vampires weren't killed, were they? They were trapped and now they're free, thanks to you which means the invention is retrieval.

Damon: What is it?

John: The only thing that matters is that I want it back and you're going to help me if you want your secret safe.

Damon: Why bring me into it John? I mean, I don't know what you are talking about much less who has it.

John: Oh come on Damon! You were around back then, you know who these people are, what they look like. He was friendly with a woman who turned out to be a vampire. Her name was Pearl. Does that ring a bell?

[Long pause, they look at each other.]

Damon: I'm not playing anymore. Get out. Get out.

John: I beg your pardon?

Damon: You know, I only entertain this whole blackmail scheme thing of yours because I thought that you and Isobel could lead me to Katherine but see, now I know you've no idea where Katherine is, because if you did you would know that Katherine and Pearl were best friends. See, you don't know everything, do you John?

John: I'll tell the entire council what you are.

Damon: Go for it! I'll kill every last one of them. Then I'll sever your hand, pull your ring off, and I'll kill you too. Do you understand that?

 Mystic Falls High School 

[Carol Lockwood is teaching dance moves to the girls who are in the Mystic Falls pageant and their partners.]

Carol: Honor your partner. Stay focus, right hand around. Flirt with your eyes (Elena and Stefan are laughing) Left hand around.

Elena: This is ridiculous.

Carol: Both hands.

Stefan: You're only saying that because you don't know how to do it.

Elena: Sorry. Only one of us was around when the dance was invented.

Stefan: Ouch!

[Stefan spins Elena around and catches her in his arms.]

Elena: Woah!

Mrs Lockwood: No! No! There's no touching during this part. It's about the simple intimacy of the near touch. Very nice, Amber!

Amber: Thank you, Mrs. Lockwood!

Stefan: If you ask me, the 'near touch' is overrated.

Elena: You seem to be in a good mood.

Stefan: Is that a bad thing? Would you prefer me to be brooding and tortured?

Elena: Hey, I'm not complaining.

[Elena moves closer towards him.]

Stefan: Oh, no touching!

[Elena and Stefan go back to dancing.]
[Meanwhile, Caroline is in the hallway with Bonnie.]

Caroline: The Fell cousins don't have a shot and Amber Bradley is only on the court so the pageant doesn't look like its founding families onlyâ€”which of course it is. So that leaves Elena which totally has the sympathy vote since her parents died. How can I compete with that?

Bonnie: Very nice, very sensitive.

Caroline: Oh I'm sorry, this must sound really unimportant. In light of everything.

Bonnie: It's okay, I get it, you want to win.

Caroline: Well, my grandmother was Miss Mystic and both of my aunts. My mom is the only one who didn't get the gene and I want this. I actually deserve this.

[They enter the room where the dancing is occurring, Bonnie sees Elena and Stefan leaving.]

Elena: Bonnie. Hey.

Stefan: Hey, how are you?

[She doesn't answer, Elena and Stefan feel that there's a problem.]

Caroline: I begged Bonnie to fill in for Matt, he had to work today.

[Elena looks at Bonnie.]

Elena: Bonnie, do you have a minute?

Bonnie: We only have 30 minutes for rehearsal.

Elena: It'll only take a minute, please?

[They walk out of the room.]

Elena: Bonnie, you have to tell me what's wrong.

Bonnie: It not worth talking about.

Elena: What do you mean not worth it? You barely said ten words to me and you won't even look at Stefan. Is that what it is? Is it Stefan?

Bonnie: Listen, Elena, I can't just pretend that everything's okay. Everything my Grams did was to protect us from those vampires in the tomb. And now they're out which means she died for nothing.

Elena: I'm so sorry Bonnie. What can I do to make it better?

Bonnie: That's just did, there's nothing you can do. I blame him, Elena, him and Damon and I'm not gonna put you in a situation where you have to choose sides. I'm just having a hard time with it, okay?

[Stefan is listening to them.]
[Stefan is walking across the campus. He gets to the basketball court. One of the players has injured himself and is bleeding. Stefan tenses up and can't turn away from the scene. Alaric touches his shoulder. Stefan strangles Alaric. He realizes who it is and let's go. ]

Alaric: Stefan! Are you okay?

Stefan: Yes, I'm sorry. I was just...I was feeling a little sick.

[He leaves, Alaric watches him.]

 Gilbert Residence 

[Elena goes down the stairs; she has her dress in her arms. Someone knocks at the door. It's Alaric.]

Elena: Hey.

Alaric: Hi.

Elena: I heard you're driving.

Alaric: Yeah I am. Let me get that for you.

[He takes the dress.]

Elena: Thanks.

[He enters the house and closes the door.]

Alaric: How...how is Stefan?

Elena: What do you mean?

Alaric: You know, he seems on edge.

Elena: He went through a lot, he was in bad shape for a while but he's bouncing back now.

[They look at each other, John arrives.]

John: Alaric. Hey buddy, what are you doing here?

Alaric: I'm the chauffeur.

John: I thought I was driving.

[Jenna goes down the stairs.]

Jenna: No need, we're going with Rick.

Elena: Are we ready?

Jenna: Jeremy can ride with you.

 Founders Hall 

[Anna arrives, she goes outside. Damon rejoins her.]

Damon: In the running for Miss Mystic Falls?

Anna: Sometimes you have to wear uncomfortable heels to blend in. I remember this event from 1864, I was supposed to enter before everything happened.

Damon: Ah, nostalgia's a bitch.

Anna: If you're just gonna mock me can you move along please?

Damon: John Gilbert thinks your mom stole an artifact from Jonathan senior back in 1864.

Anna: What are you, his errand boy?

Damon: I don't know what it is but I don't want him to have it.

Anna: I could ask her but you know, you've made it pretty clear that you don't trust us so why should I even bother?

Damon: Because you want to stay in Mystic Falls and John Gilbert's in town, making that impossible. Find out where it is. He leaves, you can buy a welcome mat.

[The girls are putting their make up on. Jenna is curling Elena's hair.]

Elena: Thanks for helping me.

Jenna: Don't thank me until you're sure your hair isn't gonna burn off.

Elena: You know I remember when my mom and I were first applying for this, she was so excited.

Jenna: So were you if I recall.

Elena: I was. She just made it sound like so much fun. Lots has changed since then.

Jenna: I hate to break it to you, but its a little late for cold feet.

Elena: I don't have cold feet. I just...I think I'd be enjoying it a lot more if she was here.

Jenna: Well I tell you one thing, your hair would have a better chance if she was.

Elena: Okay, I should go put my dress on. Be careful with that thing, don't hurt anybody.

[She gets up and leaves, Caroline looks at her, she seems sad.]
[Jeremy is outside, alone, John joins him.]

John: You look miserable.

Jeremy: Are there really a whole month of these events that I'm supposed to show up at?

John: You could fight it if you want but it's part of being a Gilbert.

Jeremy: Yeah, you mentioned you know a lot about the family. You know anything about our ancestor Jonathan Gilbert?

John: Prolific writer, crazy inventor. Why do you ask?

Jeremy: Well, I read his journal.

John: Is that right?

Jeremy: Yeah, I actually found it in all dads' stuff.

John: Well, it's surprising. Most of them are locked away.

Jeremy: There are more of them?

John: Jonathan Gilbert journaled his whole life. Right down to the bitter, insane, drunken end. He had a lot of demons.

Jeremy: And did you read them?

John: I've browsed, yeah.

Jeremy: What did you think about what he wrote?

John: Crazy ramblings of a mad man, of course.

[He turns his head and sees Anna, he looks at her.]

John: She's very pretty.

[She looks at him and leaves.]

Jeremy: Yeahâ€”uhâ€”she's a friend of mine. Excuse me.

[He leaves.]
[Elena enters a room to put her dress on. Amber is already here, she's nervous.]

Elena: Are you okay, Amber?

Amber: I hate being the center of attention. I get panic attacks.

Elena: Do you need some privacy so you can change?

Amber: Actually I'm just- I'm gonna go get some air.

[She leaves and closes the door. Elena takes her dress, she sees Damon in the mirror.]

Elena: Hey, you can't be back here.

Damon: We need to talk.

Elena: Does it have to be right now?

Damon: Normally I would have a completely different outlook of what I'm about to tell you but since it could really inconvenience me, I'll squeal.

Elena: What are you talking about?

Damon: Stefan's still drinking human blood.

Elena: What?!

Damon: Yeah, a month ago I would have rejoiced but with the council back on the alert, it is not a good time for Stefan to fly off the handle.

Elena: I know he's been a little edgy but he said that was normal.

Damon: He has a fridge full of stolen blood bank contraband in the house.

[She sits down on the couch.]

Elena: Oh my god.

Damon: He has no idea what normal is, his entire existence isn't normal. Normal to a vampire is drinking human blood but he spent all this time fighting it when he should have been learning to control it and now it's controlling him instead.

Elena: I can't believe this. I mean, it's Stefan that we're talking about here.

Damon: Stefan on human blood Elena; he'll do anything, he'll say anything because he's not gonna want to stop. Trust me.

[Jeremy is running after Anna.]

Jeremy: Anna!

Anna: What is it?

Jeremy: Come on, don't be like that.

Anna: Why not? You were basically using me to turn you into a vampire so you could be with someone else.

Jeremy: No, I wasn't using you.

Anna: Really? And how would you like to define it?

Jeremy: Look, I don't think it's any worse than you becoming friends with me so you could give your mother my blood.

Anna: How do you know that?

Jeremy: It's not important.

Anna: Seriously, Jeremy. What do you know?

Jeremy: Everything. I know everything.

[Elena is still talking to Damon.]

Elena: This is all my fault; I'm the one who fed him the blood in the first place.

[Stefan enters, interrupting them.]

Stefan: What's going on in here?

Damon: I was just filling Elena on your extra-curricular activities.

Stefan (laughing): What are you talking about?

Elena: I know about the blood, Stefan.

Damon: I'm uh - I'll be downstairs, drinking.

[He leaves. Stefan smiles.]

Stefan: I was going to tell you.

Elena: When?

Stefan: I'm fine. I'm fine, the blood, it doesn't change anything.

Elena: It's changing you.

Stefan: Why? Because I kept it a secret from you? Come on Elena, look, giving the way you're reacting right now, can you really blame me for doing that?

Elena: Are you hearing yourself right now? You've been stealing blood and lying and you say that everything's fine? Everything's not fine, Stefan!

Stefan: So what - so you and Damon all of a sudden have everything figured out then?

Elena: Itâ€˜s not about Damon. It's about what's happening to you.

Stefan: I know and I'm telling you that I'm fine. I'm fine. Please, come on. Elena I thought you...I thought you believed in me.

[Someone is knocking on the door. It's Carole Lockwood.]

Carol: Elena, let's go. The line-up's starting.

Elena: I just...I need a minute.

Carol: You're not even dressed yet. Escorts wait downstairs, Stefan.

[He looks at Elena and leaves.]
[Stefan goes into the bathroom and slams the door. He puts his fist into the mirror and breaks it. Amber enters in the bathroom.]

Amber: Oh God, sorry!

[Stefan's face has changed; he goes towards her.]
[The escorts, the mayor and a crowd of people are waiting for the girls.]

Mayor Lockwood: Miss Tina Fell, escorted by Bartholomew Whitmore.

[Tina goes down the stairs. Upstairs Caroline and Elena are waiting.]

Carol: Has anyone seen Amber?

Elena (looking if she sees Stefan downstairs): Do you see Stefan down there?

[Caroline look above the balcony.]

Caroline: Nope, just my boring fill in escort.

Elena: What happened to Matt?

Caroline: They wouldn't let him out of work. Wait, what happened to Stefan?

Elena: I don't know, he just disappeared somewhere, I don't know. What am I doing? I never should have gone through with this.

Caroline: What do you mean?

Elena: I need to find Stefan, this isn't me, I'm not this person anymore.

Caroline: No, no, no way, no. You had your chance to drop out and believe me I was all for it because there is no way that I could beat you. Elena, you're doing this because it was important to your mom.

Mayor Lockwood: Miss Caroline Forbes and her escort Jeffrey Lockwood Hamilton.

[She looks at Elena and goes down the stairs.]

Carol: Elena, you're next.

[Jeremy is still talking with Anna.]

Anna: You're missing Elena's introduction.

Jeremy: I don't care.

Anna: So, she has no idea you read her journal?

Jeremy: She keeps things from me, I'm gonna keep things from her.

Anna: What are you gonna do now? Now that you know everything that she's been hiding from you?

Jeremy: I don't know. There's a part of me that's so angry, you know, that she covered up what happened to Vicki and erased my memory but there's also this other part of me that's glad. I...I don't want to remember Vicki like that.

Anna: As a monster?

Jeremy: No, as someone who wanted to hurt me.

Anna: When I met you, you were just a part of my plan to get my mother back but then things changed...All the time we spent together...I would never do anything to hurt you, not now. You know that right?

Jeremy: Yeah I know that.

[They look at each other and smile. John is behind them, he heard everything.]
[Stefan is in the parking lot with Amber; he has her by the arm and is walking with her.]

Amber: Where are we going?

Stefan: I don't know.

Amber: I'm in the ceremony.

[He pushes her against his car.]

Stefan: Not now you're not.

[He compels her.]

Stefan: You're standing in the parking lot with me.

Amber: I'm in the parking lot with you.

Stefan: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not very good to be around right now, I'm a little bit on the edge. I've been drinking the human stuff and it's really screwing with my head. She knows now. God! She wasn't supposed to found out, I didn't want her to found out, now everything's ruined.

Amber: You seem sad.

[He laughs.]

Stefan: I'm not sad. I'm freaking hungry!

[Elena is waiting upstairs.]

Mayor Lockwood: Miss Elena Gilbert, escorted by Mister Stefan Salvatore.

[Damon looks for Stefan. Elena goes down the stairs and looks for Stefan but she doesn't see him. Damon takes Stefan's place to escort Elena. She smiles and rejoins him.]

Elena: (whispering) Where is Stefan?

Damon: (whispering) I don't know.

[He takes her hand and they rejoins the others girls and their escorts outside. They pass by Jenna and Alaric.]

Jenna: (to Alaric) What is she doing with Damon?

Alaric: I have no idea.

[The couples take their positions for the dance. They bow and curtsey to their respective partner.]

Elena: (whispering) What are we gonna do?

Damon: (whispering) Right now, we just have to get through this.

[The girls and their escorts begin to dance. Elena and Damon dance, they look at each other and smile. The dance ends.]
[Stefan is still in the parking lot with Amber.]

Stefan: I don't hurt people. I don't do that. I'm the good brother.

Amber: Do you want to hurt me?

[He looks at her.]

Stefan: I want to kill you, I want to rip into your skin and I want to feed on your blood.

[He touches her hair and looks at her neck.]

Stefan: Under your skin, pulsating, floating.

[He touches her neck.]

Stefan: Your carotid artery right here. If you puncture this just right you can control the blood flow. It takes practice but it doesn't have to make a mess, you don't have to waste any.

Amber: What's stopping you?

Stefan (still touching amber's face): If I do this, if I give in, there's no going back.

Amber: Then don't.

Stefan: I just want one taste; that's all I need, I just want one taste.

[His face changes.]

Amber: One taste.

[He finally bites her and drinks her blood.]
[The girls are on the stage, the mayor arrives.]

Caroline: Where is Amber?

Elena: I don't know.

Mayor Lockwood: Before I crown the winner, I'd like to offer a personal thank you to all of these young ladies for their efforts to better our community.

[Everyone applause.]

Mayor Lockwood: So, without further a due it is my honor to announce our very own Miss Mystic Falls, Miss Caroline Forbes!

[She is surprised. She and Elena are laughing.]

Elena: Congratulations!

Caroline: I actually won!

[They embrace each other; the mayor puts the banner around her shoulder.]
[John and Sheriff Forbes are in the bathroom where Stefan was earlier.]

John: There is blood on the glass.

[They look at each other.]

Sheriff Forbes: Get me Damon Salvatore.

[Stefan is still in the parking lot with Amber.]

Stefan: I can't do this.

Amber: What's the matter?

Stefan: I can't do this.

Amber: It's okay, it doesn't hurt that much, just not so hard next time.

Stefan: Oh god oh god oh god! I can't stop.

[He touches her face.]

Stefan: Why aren't you afraid of me?

Amber: You told me not to be.

Stefan: What? What's your name?

Amber: Amber.

Stefan: Listen to me, Amber. I need you to be afraid of me. I need you to run like hell do you understand me? Run, run now!

[She runs.]
[Damon is waiting for Elena, she rejoins him.]

Elena: What is it, did you find him?

Damon: There were signs of a struggle in the upstairs bathroom.

[Bonnie is looking at them.]

Damon: There was blood and that Amber girl is missing.

Elena: Oh my god! He wouldn't hurt her, he won't!

Damon: Let's just find him, okay? Let's get your coat come on!

[They leave, Bonnie follows them.]
[Amber is running but she falls into Stefan.]

Amber: You said to run!

Stefan: I changed my mind.

[She screams and he bites her. Elena, Damon and Bonnie arrive.]

Elena: Stefan!

[He releases her.]

Damon: Stefan, come on get control. It's okay, come on. Breath through it man.

[Stefan catches Damon and throws him against a tree. Damon gets up.]

Elena: Stefan stop it!

[All the sudden Stefan holds his head, Bonnie is casting a spell that hurts him. She stops.]

Damon: It's okay. Stefan.

[Stefan runs away.]
[The police arrive. Damon, Bonnie and Elena are still here.]

Sheriff Forbes: She doesn't remember what happened.

Damon: It's a good thing the girls got here when they did, she lost a lot of blood.

Sheriff Forbes (to Bonnie and Elena): You didn't see anything?

[Long pause, Elena and Damon look at Bonnie.]

Elena: No, we just found her and then called Damon.

Bonnie: Is she gonna be okay?

Sheriff Forbes: It looks like it yeah. Why don't you girls get back to the party? Damon and I can take it from here.

Elena: Okay.

[Elena and Bonnie leave; Damon stays with the Sheriff.]

Sheriff Forbes: They didn't see the bite mark?

Damon: No, I got here before they got too close. There was too much blood, they couldn't see it clearly.

[They look at each other.]
[Bonnie goes to her car, Elena follows her.]

Elena: Bonnie, can we talk about this?

Bonnie: There's nothing to talk about.

Elena: Bonnie, please!

Bonnie: I told you I wasn't gonna make you choose but I need to make the choice for myself. Please just leave me alone.

[She gets into her car, Elena looks sad.]
[Jeremy is still talking to Anna. Jenna calls him.]

Jenna: Jer, are you ready?

Jeremy: Just a sec.

[She leaves and runs into John.]

John: Who's that girl with Jeremy?

Jenna: His friend, Anna.

John: What's her story?

Jenna: Why so nosy?

John: I'm just curious; he really seems to like her.

Jenna: She's new in town, I think. She and her mom Pearl, the family who you're so rudely trying to prevent from buying Grayson's building.

John (looking at Anna and Jeremy): Her mother's name is Pearl?

Jenna: Yes, so?

John: Well, I believe I already know all about her.

[Alaric goes out, Elena is waiting for him.]

Alaric: Good, there you are. Jenna wanted me to get the car.

[He looks at Elena, and sees that she's upset.]

Alaric: What happened?

 Salvatore Boarding House 

[Damon is going home but Anna is waiting for him.]

Damon: All right now, this is getting weird.

Anna: We're here to talk.

[Pearl arrives.]

Damon: Not in the mood, today's been a no good, very bad day.

Pearl: Annabelle tells me you're looking for something I took from Jonathan Gilbert.

Damon: Iâ€˜m listening.

[She gives him the device.]

Damon: What is it?

Pearl: Jonathan was passionate about his inventions. He confided in me that he had created a detection device meant to track down the town's vampire element.

Damon: It was a pocket watch.

Pearl: That's what it turned out to be yes. But that's not what I stole. I discovered my mistake when I saw the watch in Jonathan's hand, the night they took us, its stile pointed at me.

[Damon looks at the device.]

Damon: So what is this?

Pearl: I have no idea but now it's yours.

Damon: What's the catch?

Pearl: There is no catch. My daughter wants to stay here. I want to stay here. You refused to trust us and for good reason. Consider this an apology.

[He looks at them and leaves.]
[Stefan enters in his bedroom, he tries to calm down. Elena arrives.]

Stefan: You shouldn't be here.

Elena: I know.

Stefan: Now you know.

Elena: That wasn't you.

Stefan: Oh, it was absolutely me. A monster, a predator, that's who I am Elena.

Elena: That's what the blood makes you.

Stefan: The blood brings out what's inside of me and if you think any differently then you're an idiot.

Elena: I know this isn't you Stefan.

Stefan: I wanted to drain every ounce of blood from that girl's body.

Elena: No.

Stefan: It's who I am Elena.

Elena: No, you can't scare me off.

Stefan: Why would you risk it? Why would you come here?

Elena: Because I did this, this is my fault; I'm the one who made you drink the blood.

Stefan: All you did was expose me to who I really am.

Elena: This isn't you.

Stefan (screaming): Stop saying that!!!

[She starts walking towards him.]

Stefan: Don't get any closer to me.

Elena: I'm not gonna let this happen to you.

Stefan: Stop.

Elena: Stefan, I'm not gonna give up on you! I believe in you!

Stefan: Stop!!!

[He pushes her against the wall very roughly and slams his fist into the wall.]

Stefan: Stop!

[She's afraid; he looks at her.]

Stefan: I'm so sorry.

Elena: It's okay. It's okay.

[He puts his head on her shoulder. He begins to cry.]

Stefan: I don't know what's happening to me.

Elena: It's okay, Stefan. Its okay. You're gonna be okay.

[She takes a vervain dart and stabs him with it. He falls and Damon enters in the room, she looks at him.]

Damon: Sure you want to do this?

Elena: I'm sure.

[They put him in a cell in the basement. He closes the door.]

Damon: There's no guarantee it's going to work.

Elena: It has to.

Damon: Coming?

Elena: I'm gonna stay here.

[She sits down opposite the cell door, resting her back against the wall. Damon looks at her for a moment then sits down as well, facing her.]
