<p>(The scene picks up from the end of the <a href="/wiki/I%27ll_Wed_You_in_the_Golden_Summertime" title="I'll Wed You in the Golden Summertime">previous episode</a>. The wedding ceremony has descended into chaos, and people are screaming across the room. Some of the attendees of the party are already dead, and many more are injured or dying. Damon is kneeling on the floor at the front of the altar, where he is clutching Elena's unconscious body against his lap and desperately trying to awaken her)
</p>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">DAMON</a>: Elena?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena remains unconscious and limp in his arms)
</p>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">DAMON</a>: (worriedly) Come on. Hey, wake up. Elena?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon bites his wrist and tries to feed Elena vampire blood. On the other end of the altar, Alaric is holding Jo, whose eyes are closed and whose abdomen is bleeding heavily, soaking Alaric's hands and clothes. He looks devastated to the point where he can do nothing but sob desperately)
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: (distraught) Oh god. Someone, please help.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Joshua struggles to stand to his feet by bracing himself on a chair. He is furious as he looks around the room)
</p>
<dl><dd> JOSHUA: (shouts) Kai!
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon is trying to feed Elena his blood, but she's not conscious to be able to actively drink it)
</p>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">DAMON</a>: Come on, just drink it.
</dd></dl>
<p>(The blood simply dribbles down Elena's chin) No! (He becomes distraught as well and starts looking around for the others)
</p>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">DAMON</a>: Stefan? STEFAN?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan and Caroline, who were knocked backward by Kai's magic, stand to their feet, both of them covered with blood from the broken glass and projectiles hitting them. When they see Damon clutching Elena's unconscious body, their eyes widen in alarm)
</p>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">DAMON</a>: She won't wake up.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Oh, my God.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">DAMON</a>: She won't wake up. I don't understand.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Stefan_Salvatore" title="Stefan Salvatore">STEFAN</a>: Get her to the hospital, <i>now</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon realizes that this is the obvious solution)
</p>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">DAMON</a>: Yeah.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon scoops Elena up in his arms and vamp-speeds away. Caroline turns to Stefan with fearful eyes)
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: (worriedly) She's human, what if she doesn't -
</dd></dl>
<p>(Suddenly, Stefan and Caroline's necks are instantly snapped in mid-air. When they fall to the floor, Kai is revealed to be standing behind them, having used magic to break their necks.)
</p>
<dl><dd> KAI: Nothing personal, but this is a family matter now.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Kai turns and sees Alaric, still sobbing desperately as he clings to Jo's lifeless body, his hands becoming more and more blood-soaked from her fatal wounds)
</p>
<dl><dd> KAI: Tsk. Oh.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Joshua finally comes back, holding an Ascendant in his hand and shouts an incantation to a spell)
</p>
<dl><dd> JOSHUA: (chants loudly) <i>Sanguinem filio. Sanguinem effurgarex perpetuum</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KAI: (sighs) Let me guess, Prison World?
</dd></dl>
<p>(The other Gemini Coven members who are still alive stand to their feet and begin to chant as well)
</p>
<dl><dd> GEMINI COVEN: (chants) <i>Sanguinem filio. Sanguinem effurgarex perpetuum.</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KAI: (unimpressed) I mean, you can't kill me. Or else you all die too, right.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: (sobbing) Ohh, ohh.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Kai turns to Alaric with fake sympathy)
</p>
<dl><dd> KAI: (softly) Hey, I'm sorry about your twinsies. I just don't feel like competing for leadership with future Gemini twins. (He kneels down next to him) See... when your family decides that your nothing but an irredeemable piece of trash, well... I guess the best thing to do is prove them right, right?
</dd></dl>
<p>(The witches are still chanting and Kai stands up with a broken shard of glass in his hand and turns around to his father.)
</p>
<dl><dd> KAI: This ought to do it.
</dd></dl>
<p>(He stabs himself in his neck and falls down on the floor, gagging intensely as he bleeds to death)
</p>
<dl><dd> JOSHUA: (horrified) No!
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ELENA.27S_MIND--_THE_WOODS"> ELENA'S MIND-- THE WOODS </span></h2>
<p>(Elena and Alaric are in Elena's mind, where they're in work-out gear and sparring with each other, just as they did in <i><a href="/wiki/Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit" title="Smells Like Teen Spirit">Smells Like Teen Spirit</a></i>. Elena punches the pads in Alaric's hands and then gestures to him to give her more)
</p>
<dl><dd> ELENA: You're going easy on me. Come on. This is supposed to be a special moment.
</dd></dl>
<p>(She punches the pads again, but Alaric becomes so overwhelmed that he stops what he's doing)
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Yeah, no. I can't do this.
</dd></dl>
<p>(He pulls off the padded gloves and throws them onto the ground before walking away. Elena follows him and shakes her head)
</p>
<dl><dd> ELENA: Don't do that. Don't give up like that.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Why not? (He turns around so his back it to Elena) I have nothing left to fight for.
</dd></dl>
<p>(He walks over to where a punching dummy is standing and begins punching it furiously with his bare hands. Elena comes up behind him and wraps her arms around his shoulders and squeezes him tightly so he can't move)

<p>(Elena is laying in a hospital bed where a a doctor is checking up on her. Damon is outside in the hallway, where he's watching the doctor work from the window and staring at her)
</p><p>(The scene cuts back and forth between the hospital and the boarding house as Damon calls Bonnie, who is in the kitchen where Matt is bandaging up her slit wrists from when Kai attacked them earlier. When Bonnie sees it is Damon calling her, she answers it quickly)
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Damon!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">DAMON</a>: (sighs in relief) Ah. Bonnie Bennett. You have <i>no</i> idea how good it is to hear your voice right now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: (anxiously) Damon, Kai's out.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">DAMON</a>: (sighs) I know. I'm glad you're safe. I was worried Kai already got to you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: He <i>did</i>. And I don't know how, but I'm still alive. He drained my blood and that's all.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">DAMON</a>: (unhappily) That's <i>not</i> all. He was at the wedding. Jo's dead, he killed her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: (stunned and horrified) Oh my god.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Damon_Salvatore" title="Damon Salvatore">DAMON</a>: (frustratedly) And Elena got knocked out, and she's not waking up. The doctors keep telling me that there's nothing <i>physically</i> wrong with her. I don't know what to do, Bon.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Stay there. Okay? I'm coming.

<p>(Stefan and Caroline are scrunched in the backseat of a car. When they start to wake up, they realize where they are, and that Caroline is laying with her head on Stefan's chest. Caroline quickly sits up, and the two find Enzo driving the car and become even more confused)
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Good, you're up. Sorry to be indecorous, but you were both <i>solidly</i> unconscious when I pulled you from the wedding mayhem.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Where are we going? (She suddenly remembers the chaos at the wedding) Elena!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Elena is in the hospital with Damon. Kai is dead, and all the Gemini's are going down with him. And. I grabbed the two of you to help me deal with a bigger problem.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: (exasperatedly) There's a <i>bigger</i> problem?!
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WAREHOUSE_DISTRICT"> WAREHOUSE DISTRICT </span></h2>
<p>(Stefan, Caroline, and Enzo arrive to the block of warehouses outside of Mystic Falls, where Lily and Enzo came in the previous episode to find Lily's "family." Stefan finds Lily desperately opening warehouse door after warehouse door in search for her den)
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: (calls out) Valerie? Malcolm?
</dd></dl>
<p>(When she realizes that there is no one in the storage space, she closes the door. Stefan sighs in annoyance and approaches her)
</p>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Stefan_Salvatore" title="Stefan Salvatore">STEFAN</a>: Get in the car, please.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: (rambling anxiously) 1702 Route 12. That's... That's where we are, right? I mean I read the map very carefully. He... He said they would be here. They're probably scared out of their minds.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Stefan_Salvatore" title="Stefan Salvatore">STEFAN</a>: (frustrated) Who are you talking about?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Lily opens the door to another storage space and searches it)
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: My friends. Kai brought them back when he escaped that prison. (She looks around the room but there's nothing in there. She turns around again.) They're here, somewhere.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <a href="/wiki/Stefan_Salvatore" title="Stefan Salvatore">STEFAN</a>: (sighs) He lied to you. There's <i>nobody</i> out here. You made a deal with a sociopath, and now a lot of people are <i>dead</i>. You're wasting your time!
</dd></dl>
<p>(Lily walks away, ignoring Stefan's comments.)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WEDDING_LOCATION">WEDDING LOCATION</span></h2>
<p>(The members of the Gemini Coven are in various stages of dying as a result of Kai, as the leader of the coven, killing himself. Joshua manages to stumble onto his feet and desperately looks around the room as he calls out for his family)
</p>
<dl><dd> JOSHUA: Where's my daughter. Liv! Liv!
</dd></dl>
<p>(Just outside the barn where the wedding was held, Tyler and Liv, who were thrown outside from the force of Kai's spell, are covered in blood and laying in the grass. Tyler has a huge piece of glass lodged in his stomach, and Liv is crawling to him. She looks horrified when she realizes the extent of the carnage)
</p>
<dl><dd> LIV: Oh, Tyler. Oh God, no. This can't be happening (She coughs up some blood) Oh, God. What's happening to me?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Tyler turns his head to look at her with a sad, guilty expression)
</p>
<dl><dd> TYLER: Kai's dead, Liv. (Liv looks horrified and upset) I heard the screams. Your dad, your coven, they're all in there... dying. Which means--
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LIV: (overwhelmed) No, no, no.
</dd></dl>
<p>(The two hear more screaming from inside, and Tyler reaches out so he can intertwine his fingers with Liv's)
</p>
<dl><dd> TYLER: I love you, Liv. You need to know that, if this has to be it for us.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LIV: (determined) <i>No.</i> You're <i>not</i> dying, not after everything. You're not dying, Tyler.
</dd></dl>
<p>(She looks up at the sky and sees the full moon above them, which gives her an idea)
</p>
<dl><dd> LIV: It's a full moon. If you turn, it will heal you. You <i>have</i> to.
</dd></dl>
<p>(When Tyler realizes what she's suggesting, he shakes his head vigorously)
</p>
<dl><dd> TYLER: <i>No.</i> I'm not triggering it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LIV: (crying) You once told me that I gave you a second chance, and you <i>promised</i> me that you wouldn't waste it. I love you. Let me do this for you.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Tyler takes a deep breath and yanks the piece of glass out of his stomach before he sits up and looks at her, clearly conflicted and not wanting to do this)
</p>
<dl><dd> TYLER: (groans in pain) Agh.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Tyler rolls over so he's leaning over Liv and kisses her softly before pulling away and looking at her)
</p>
<dl><dd> LIV: (whispers) Don't waste it.
</dd></dl>
<p>(She puts his hands on her mouth, just like when she smothered the man Tyler hit so he wouldn't turn in <i><a href="/wiki/The_World_Has_Turned_and_Left_Me_Here" title="The World Has Turned and Left Me Here">The World Has Turned and Left Me Here</a></i>)
</p>
<dl><dd> TYLER: (crying) I love you.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Liv starts choking as she suffocates, but Tyler keeps holding his hands on her mouth despite not wanting her to die. When she stops moving, he realizes that she's dead, and he pulls his hands away from her face. When he is hit with the implications of what he's just done, he screams in anguish)

When the phone continues to ring, Tyler groans in frustration and anxiety)
</p>
<dl><dd> TYLER: <i>Come on</i>, answer! (More of his bones start to break as he shifts) Uhn, argh, ahhh! Answer, damn it!

<p>(Finally, Matt answers the phone)

<dl><dd> MATT: Ty, what's wrong?

<dl><dd> TYLER: (sighs in shame) I triggered my curse.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: (horrified) No.

<p>(Bonnie, noticing the fear in Matt's voice, walks toward him)

<dl><dd> LILY: (offended) We spent a century and a half together. We're loyal to each other. Our relationship is a deeper bond than I have <i>ever</i> known. What other word would I use?

He then gets in his car and numbly sits in the passenger seat for a moment as he processes the night's events. After a short pause, he reaches into his glove box and pulls out a loaded pistol. When he looks up, he sees Kai walking toward him through the windshield and gets out of the car to confront him. Kai takes note of his devastated appearance)

<p>(Alaric shoots Kai multiple times with his gun, but it has no effect. After a moment, the bullets pop themselves out of his wounds as he heals, and he picks one up and holds it up for him to see.)
</p>
<dl><dd> KAI: Freaky, right? I turned myself into one of Lily's Heretics. It's really incredible, actually. I can <i>literally</i> siphon the magic of my vampirism and convert it into <i>more magic</i>.

You left me behind in 1903, which I did <i>not</i> appreciate, but I guess you forgot about that old Canadian rock filled with Bennett blood.

The scene then cuts to downtown Mystic Falls, where Matt is driving down the road in a police cruiser, wearing a deputy's uniform. The town square is in ruins, and the Mystic Grill looks as though it's boarded up as fires rage in trash cans on the sidewalk. Matt looks defeated as he continues to drive past the clock tower, where a figure is standing near the top.
