<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ROUTE_70--_GLENWOOD.2C_ARKANSAS"> ROUTE 70-- GLENWOOD, ARKANSAS </span></h2>
<p><i>[Stefan, wearing a green hoodie, a tan jacket, jeans (not the clothing he was wearing when Rayna stabbed him with the Phoenix Sword in the <a href="/wiki/Days_of_Future_Past/Transcript" title="Days of Future Past/Transcript">previous episode</a>), awakens with a gasp to find himself laying flat on his back in the middle of an unknown. He's all alone, his hair is mussed up, he has a bloody gash on his forehead, and he's missing a boot. Stefan grunts and breathes quickly as he takes in his surroundings, and his eyes widen in horror when he sees shattered glass covered in blood that leads to the site of a gruesome car accident. The door of a Jeep has been ripped off, and the bloody, battered body of a middle-aged man hangs from the driver's seat, only kept in by the seat belt he's wearing. In front of the wrecked car is a school bus that has apparently hit the Jeep and is currently being consumed by flames, and Stefan scrambles to his feet before rushing toward the inferno]</i>
</p><p><i>[Once he gets to the bus, the sound of a screaming man and woman startles Stefan into action, and he shoves at the school bus door with all of his strength and looks confused when it doesn't budge]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> WOMAN: Help!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MAN: Help! Help...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> WOMAN: Help! Help! Help!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan shoves his shoulder into the door over and over again until it finally busts open, and he wastes no time getting inside and helping a young, injured woman out of the bus while the others yell in fear. Once he's safely deposited her onto the ground outside of the bus, he runs back inside to help a young man out, accidentally tripping and causing them both to fall onto the pavement just as as sirens are heard approaching them. Stefan stands to his feet and looks concerned as three police cruisers with their lights flashing drive up to the crash site, sighing in relief as help arrives]</i>
</p><p><i>[After the others have been rescued, Stefan sits on a nearby stretcher, covered in a warm blanket and with an oxygen mask over his face, while a female paramedic checks him out]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PARAMEDIC: Easy. Breathe slow. Dizzy is normal. And keep your foot off the ground, we're in a cold snap. Weather folks say temperature's a record low. What's your name?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[frowns]</i> I don't remember...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> PARAMEDIC: Let's take a look at you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The paramedic takes out her pen light and frowns when she notices a large gash on his right shoulder blade. She winces sympathetically as she pulls his collar aside to get a better look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PARAMEDIC: Ooh, wow. Whoever you are, you are one lucky SOB. You're the first person I've met to survive a gash to the carotid.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan winces as the paramedic puts a gauze bandage over his wound, but he's quickly distracted by the sight of a dead victim being wheeled away on a stretcher in a body bag, which causes him to look upset. The paramedic notices this and gives him another sympathetic look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PARAMEDIC: Hey... Take it from me-- even heroes can't save them all.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan frowns in confusion at this statement]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What'd you just call me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> PARAMEDIC: <i>[slowly]</i> A hero? That's what those cheerleaders are saying, anyway. I'm keeping them at bay until I've ruled out concussive amnesia.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan's brow furrows in concentration when he finally remembers who he is]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: My name's Stefan Salvatore.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> PARAMEDIC: And there we go! Do you know where you are, Stefan?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan's demeanor becomes defeated when he remembers what has happened to him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Yes... I'm in Hell.

<p><i>[Night has fallen, but Damon is still sitting on the ground next to Stefan's body at the airfield, where he is looking sadly at his "dead" brother]</i>
</p><p><i>[Meanwhile, Valerie, who has just found Nora and Mary Louise's bodies and has wrapped them in sheets to be burned in the middle of a huge field near the airfield, is holding Rayna's sword in her hands, staring at the now-broken Phoenix Stone with a devastated expression while crying for Nora, Mary Louise and Stefan. After a moment, Damon slowly approaches her from behind, and Valerie's expression turns stony as she addresses him, not even bothering to turn around to face him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: They didn't know... that Rayna had stabbed Stefan. That his spirit was already trapped in the Phoenix Stone. They probably thought they were doing the world a favor.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sarcastically]</i> Well, that's awfully generous. Of you, not them. Considering they never gave a damn about anyone else other than each other. So, if you're done mourning Thelma and Mary Louise, I think we should get out of here.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie finally turns to face him with angry tears in her eyes as she starts in on him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I'm not going <i>anywhere</i> with you. You could have prevented this. All you had to do was take Stefan's scar and put your brother first, for <i>once</i> in your life.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hey! I'm trying to make it right, which is why we have to find Rayna and get Stefan's soul back in his body.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: The Stone is destroyed, Damon. And Stefan with it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: We don't know that.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Yes, we do, if we have logic, and a sense of reason, and a <i>brain</i>. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I see it differently, okay? If Stefan's dead, then I'm responsible. Which means I'm going to spend the rest of eternity haunted and doing penance and seeing my own self-loathing reflected in everyone else's actual loathing. And, I'm not ready for any of those things-- ergo, he's not dead. Try it my way. It's less depressing.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I see I've been charitable in assuming you have a brain...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You can keep being a Debbie Downer, or you can do a locator spell and help me find Rayna. What do you say?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie turns and walks away, and Damon looks annoyed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Where are you going?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: To do what you just told me to do-- without you. <i>Invisique</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie vanishes as her cloaking spell takes effect, and Damon scoffs in frustration]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Really? <i>Really</i>?
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ROUTE_70--_GLENWOOD.2C_ARKANSAS_2"> ROUTE 70-- GLENWOOD, ARKANSAS </span></h2>
<p><i>[Back at the car accident site, Stefan is still confused about what is happening and assumes that he's trapped in the Phoenix Stone]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I don't get it. My failed attempt at being a hero, the dead bodies... What's the lesson here?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> PARAMEDIC: <i>[confused]</i> I'm not sure I'm following you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I remember being stabbed by the Phoenix Sword, which means this is all some sort of looping nightmare, custom-made from my own psyche.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> PARAMEDIC: <i>[concerned]</i> Maybe I was a little hasty in my check-up. Can you look straight ahead?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[frustrated]</i> I think I'm fine. I'm just... I'm not in the mood for charades, all right? Can we just skip to the torture please?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan calls out to the cops nearby]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hey, officers! Why don't we just get on with it, huh?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> PARAMEDIC: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sit down. You are not making any sense.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[One of the officers walks toward them as the paramedic takes a wallet out of Stefan's jacket pocket and looks at the driver's license inside to get his information]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OFFICER: Marty Hammond?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: No, but okay...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> PARAMEDIC: That's what it says on this license.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I believe you, but that's not my wallet.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> PARAMEDIC: <i>[concerned]</i> Possible memory loss. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> OFFICER: Have you been drinking, sir?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Oh! I get it. I'm a vampire with control issues, and alcoholism is a metaphor for my bloodlust. See, now we're getting somewhere!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The paramedic and police officer seem to be getting more worried and confused with every statement Stefan makes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OFFICER: Sir, could you stand up for me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Are we going to a warmer hellscape?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> OFFICER: Maybe... First, I'm gonna have to ask you to walk in a straight line.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan frowns and looks around at the scene in confusion]</i>

<p><i>[Matt is sitting at the bar at the MYSTIC GRILL when he suddenly gets a phone call, which he quickly answers]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Hello?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt is shocked to hear that it is Rayna who is calling him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Matt? I need help...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>Rayna</i>?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: You're the only person that I trust.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: You put Stefan back in the Stone?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Yes, but--
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt cuts her off as he picks up a bottle of liquor from behind the bar and uses it to pour himself another drink]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Then we have nothing to talk about. I did my part. I'm out.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Rayna groans as if in pain and taps the payphone against her temple in frustration before she replies]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: You don't understand! Those bitches destroyed the Stone! He's free. They're <i>all</i> free.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[shocked]</i> Wait-- what are you talking about?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt becomes even more concerned when she doesn't respond]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Rayna? What do you mean, "free?"
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When the scene cuts back to Rayna, it is revealed that Valerie has appeared and is now holding Rayna in a headlock, though the phone is still pressed to her ear]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Well? Go ahead and answer him. What do you mean, <i>"free?"</i>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Rayna gasps for breath due to the strength of her choke-hold and drops the phone]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Meanwhile, back at the DALLAS AIRFIELD, Damon has just returned to find that Stefan's body has vanished. The scene cuts to Damon's car, where he's speeding down the road as he tries to call Valerie, though it goes straight to voicemail]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[voicemail greeting] This is Valerie. And now, you speak.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The voicemail beeps as Damon leaves her a message]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Valerie, I don't know why you took Stefan's body, but if anything happens to...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon slows down and stops talking when he sees someone walking toward him, and when he sees that it's Stefan (wearing the same clothing he "died" in), Damon's voice becomes confused]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: ...My brother? Never mind.
</dd></dl>

</p><p><i>[The other Stefan from ROUTE 70 is doing a field sobriety test while the police officer watches him walk in a straight line away from him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OFFICER: Nice work, Marty. And back to me.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan rolls his eyes and turns to walk back to the officer]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Meanwhile, at the PHONE BOOTH, Valerie is holding a knife to Rayna's throat as she questions her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: I can hear them... All the voices...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie keeps her hand around Rayna's neck, but spins her around so she can face her, the tip of the knife still pressed to her throat]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: What are you talking about?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: <i>[dazed]</i> They're coming from everywhere.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Back at ROUTE 70, Stefan has just finished his field sobriety test and looks at the officer with annoyance]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What is this supposed to prove?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> OFFICER: That you were under the influence when you were driving the bus.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks shocked by this remark]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What did you say?
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Over at the PHONE BOOTH, Rayna and Valerie are still talking, and Rayna looks completely overwhelmed]</i>

<dl><dd> RAYNA: When you destroyed the Phoenix Stone, all the souls inside escaped. Scattered. And I can hear them. <i>Alive</i>. Every one of them.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[horrified]</i> You're saying that <i>every vampire</i> you ever killed with that sword is now wandering the earth?

</p><p><i>[At ROUTE 70, the officer is now questioning Stefan]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OFFICER: What the hell happened to you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[confused]</i> I'm not sure... I woke up in the middle of the road, and I saw the bus on fire.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> OFFICER: <i>[sarcastically]</i> Yeah, you're a real hero, Marty-- saving half the kids from the accident <i>you</i> caused.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[frustrated]</i> Why do you keep calling me "Marty?"
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Rayna and Valerie continue their conversation at the PHONE BOOTH, where Rayna is genuinely terrified about what is happening]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: I burned all their original bodies, which means the Stone's prisoners are in random corpses. Vampire, human... it doesn't matter. The spirits fled, scatter-shot into the first dead piece of flesh they could find.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Meanwhile, the other "Stefan" is now riding in the passenger seat of Damon's car while they drive]</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> OFFICER: Here you go.

<dl><dd> STEFAN/MARTY: And what if I refuse to take the test?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> OFFICER: Then you're not giving me much of a choice.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> OFFICER: Stop. Calm down!

</p>
<dl><dd> OFFICER: Hey! Get back here! Stop! STOP!

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: I'm calling to warn you--

Three years. <i>Three years</i>-- no stabbings, no hostage swaps, no supernatural threats breathing down our neck, okay? We are getting married in a month. We have got kids that we need to take care of.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[sighs]</i> Look, Caroline was bait to draw Stefan out. That's all.

<i>[Inside, Alaric is sitting at his kitchen table, Josie and Lizzie's stuffed unicorn and teddy bear laying on the table top where Alaric left them when he stopped packing, while Valerie explains the situation to him.

</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: It's like what happened with Jo, only more random. All the vampire souls from the Phoenix Stone have found fresh corpses to inhabit. Some vampires, some not.

</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Okay. What do we need to do?

He continues to cough and hack, groaning in pain, until he sees a cabin nearby and sighs in relief]</i>
</p><p><i>[When he rushes over to the cabin, he walks onto the porch and tries to look through the windows, only to find that they've been boarded up. He turns to try to use his handcuffed hands to open the door, but the door is locked and the knob won't turn. Finally, he uses his cuffed hands to pull off the board over the window, though it takes most of his human strength to do so, and once the window has been uncovered, he kicks his leg through the window and shatters the glass before carefully shoving himself through it, landing on the leather couch under the window and subsequently rolling off of it and onto the floor, groaning in pain upon impact. He then forces himself into a seated position and takes a look around the cabin, which is small but well-furnished, He uses his feet to open the various drawers in the kitchen in hopes of finding something to break out of his cuffs, but when his efforts yield no results, he sighs in frustration]</i>
</p><p><i>[He glances out the window, where he sees a shed behind the cabin and decides to make his way there. Inside, he finds a slew of construction tools, including a vice, which causes him to sigh in both relief and in annoyance at the effort it will take to break through his cuffs. He arranges two cinder blocks on the floor to stand on so his hands will be level with the vice, and he slowly uses his bound hand to turn the stile to widen the vice enough to use it to make the cuff wider, allowing him to slide his hand through it and free himself, though it causes him obvious pain to do so]</i>

<p><i>[Damon makes to leave, but Stefan just stares at him incredulously. Damon gives him a look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: What? What's wrong?
</dd><dd> STEFAN: This. You. If you're here, then I'm safe, and I owe you one.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks away from Damon as tears fill his eyes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: But, if you're a hallucination, then I've entered the delirium phase of my withdrawal, which means I am officially and royally <i>screwed</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When Stefan looks back at the passenger seat, Damon has vanished, and Stefan nearly breaks down in sobs before he suddenly starts to retch and gag, forcing him to open the car door so he can vomit into the snow. However, he's so weak that he tumbles out of the car completely, landing on his hands and knees on the snow-covered ground. Once he's finished, he sighs and closes his eyes before falling back on his bottom and leaning his back against the side of the truck, closing his eyes]</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> CAPTAIN: All right. Try to calm down and tell me what happened.
</dd><dd> WOMAN: I saw him. He <i>attacked</i> me.

<dl><dd> DAMON: If it's okay with you, Captain, I'd like to question her myself.

<dl><dd> CAPTAIN: All right, everyone. Matt Donovan's got this.

<p><i>[Damon kneels in front of the woman and looks her in the eyes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I need you to tell me <i>exactly</i> where you saw him.
</dd><dd> WOMAN: Yeah, it was an access road off of 274. It was north of Oden. There's an outlook there.
</dd><dd> DAMON: And you're <i>sure</i> it was north?
</dd><dd> WOMAN: <i>[nods]</i> Yeah.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon stands to his feet to make an announcement]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Okay. All right, boys. He's south of Oden. Let's pull all troops down to that area, okay?

<p><i>[Damon stands and goes to walk away, and the woman calls out to him]</i>

He sees a patch of snow is glowing and desperately crawls over to it to answer it, having not realized that the woman dropped it during their struggle. On the other end of the line is Damon, who is driving his Camaro through the snow in an effort to find Stefan]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hello?
</dd><dd> DAMON: Wow. Marty's voice is, uh, huskier than I imagined.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan is both relieved and annoyed to hear his brother's voice]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Damon?
</dd><dd> DAMON: Sure picked a great night to get lost in the woods.
</dd><dd> STEFAN: Yeah, well, at least I'm starting to warm up. Which, in case you didn't know, is a <i>bad</i> sign.
</dd><dd> DAMON: <i>[concerned]</i> You gotta move, okay? Just pick a direction, start walking.
</dd><dd> STEFAN: <i>[weakly]</i> I can't. I can't even feel my legs. At this point, I can't tell if the tremors are from my withdrawal or from me freezing to death.
</dd><dd> DAMON: <i>[frustrated]</i> Stefan, just get up! This is <i>not</i> how you are going to die, Stefan Salvatore.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan can't help but chuckle and sniffle at this remark]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Alone in the wilderness, trapped in the frozen corpse of an alcoholic murderer? Uh, I don't know... Seems kind of fitting to me.
</dd><dd> DAMON: <i>[groans]</i> Come <i>on</i>. Give me <i>something</i> to work with, here.
</dd><dd> STEFAN: Day late and a dollar short. You suck at playing hero, brother.
</dd><dd> DAMON: Well, I guess I'm just not used to you being such a damsel in distress.
</dd><dd> STEFAN: Should I list all the ways in which this mess is <i>your</i> fault?
</dd><dd> DAMON: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> Sure, Stef. Go for it. I'm not doing anything important right now.
</dd><dd> STEFAN: You <i>bailed</i> on me, Damon.
</dd><dd> DAMON: <i>[interrupts]</i> Listen, Valerie and I were <i>literally</i> just about to do the transfer spell--
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan cuts him off]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Even before that. You bailed on me when you decided you'd rather live in a coffin than own up to your mistakes.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon's eyes widen in shock at this remark]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No. No, no, I was trying to prevent myself from <i>making</i> mistakes, Stefan.
</dd><dd> STEFAN: And why is that so hard for you, Damon? Don't say "Elena." You lived 160 years before you met her. I got ripped out of hell and thrown into a dead man's body, and do you know what my first thought was when I came to? "I need to save those people on the bus." I didn't know who I was, I didn't know <i>where</i> I was... it was my instinct. What are <i>your</i> instincts, Damon? What does the voice in <i>your</i> head say?
</dd><dd> DAMON: <i>[sighs]</i> You want me to say what we both already know? <i>Fine</i>. I'm selfish. I'm angry. I am impatient. And yes, until I met Elena, I wasn't interested in doing the right thing for anybody.
</dd><dd> STEFAN: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> Your brother included.
</dd><dd> DAMON: My brother included. You mad?
</dd><dd> STEFAN: Yes.
</dd><dd> DAMON: You resent me?
</dd><dd> STEFAN: Yes.
</dd><dd> DAMON: <i>Good</i>. Then get up and come kick my ass yourself.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan sighs and does as he's told, groaning as he struggles to pull himself to his feet. Damon sounds concerned by the sound of his panting]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Stefan...?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan continues to groan as he finally gets to his feet and slowly starts to put one foot in front of the other to make his way down the road]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I'm walking.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He pauses for a moment before he continues]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You want to know why this is so hard? 
</dd><dd> DAMON: Because Marty Hammond is a total train-wreck? 
</dd><dd> STEFAN: <i>[sighs]</i> Because eventually, I'm not going to be able to go on. And when that happens, I don't believe you'll be there. 
</dd></dl>

</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[impatiently]</i> Must we wait this out?
</dd><dd> ALARIC: <i>[scoffs]</i> Well, unless you want to end up in a ditch off the freeway, we're gonna spend the night right here.
</dd><dd> VALERIE: How convenient for you.
</dd><dd> ALARIC: What's <i>that</i> supposed to mean?
</dd><dd> VALERIE: Well, if this ends badly, you emerge the victor. Stefan dies through no fault of your own-- less competition for your fiancée's heart.
</dd><dd> ALARIC: Oh <i>wow</i>. How insecure do you think I am?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie gives him a knowing look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Don't pretend it hasn't crossed your mind. I am <i>very</i> familiar with the sensation of watching Stefan and Caroline from the outside.
</dd><dd> ALARIC: <i>[sarcastically]</i> Well, except for the part where Stefan ditched Caroline to travel around the world with <i>you</i>.
</dd><dd> VALERIE: You see, I never fooled myself into thinking that what I had with Stefan would last. But you? You put a ring on it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric becomes more and more annoyed with this conversation by the second]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Yeah, I proposed to Caroline, because I fell in love with her. And she said yes because it made sense for the kids. So yeah, Stefan coming back might ruin my perfect little life. So what?
</dd><dd> VALERIE: <i>[shrugs]</i> Well, for what it's worth, I'm rooting for you and Caroline.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric can't help but chuckle despite himself as he rolls his eyes]</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Ah, don't tell me you don't appreciate the irony of this? You being human?
</dd><dd> STEFAN: Well, safe to say I do <i>not</i> appreciate it at this particular moment.
</dd><dd> DAMON: Tell me, though-- what's the worst part about being human? Is it... Is it leg cramps? Is it sniffles? Frostbite? What is it?
</dd><dd> STEFAN: How about the inability to compel people?
</dd><dd> DAMON: Ooh, yeah! Yeah, that's a big one. Sucks having to play by the rules, doesn't it?
</dd><dd> STEFAN: <i>[laughs weakly]</i> Like you would know. Hey... You remember playing hide-and-seek when we were kids?
</dd><dd> DAMON: You bring that up because you used to cheat?
</dd><dd> STEFAN: <i>[scoffs]</i> I did not!
</dd><dd> DAMON: Absolutely, you did. You used to hide in Father's office, even though we weren't allowed to be in there.
</dd><dd> STEFAN: <i>Once</i>, maybe.
</dd><dd> DAMON: No. <i>All</i> the time.
</dd><dd> STEFAN: Then why was it so hard for you to find me?
</dd><dd> DAMON: 'Cause I was scared. I didn't want to break the rules.
</dd><dd> STEFAN: Maybe you were hoping Father would catch me and punish me.
</dd><dd> DAMON: No. I wasn't scared I'd get caught-- I was scared for <i>you</i>, Stefan.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon pauses for a moment before he continues]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Why do you bring up hide-and-go-seek?
</dd><dd> STEFAN: <i>[defeatedly]</i> Because you're never gonna find me.

<p><i>[Just then, Stefan is hit with a coughing fit so strong that he falls to his knees before keeling over, landing face-first in the snow and dropping the phone. When Damon doesn't get a response after that, he frowns in concern. Stefan/Marty's body is still laying in the snow when bright headlights illuminate his face as the Camaro pulls up to where he fell. Damon walks toward him and gently grabs him by the shoulders to flip him over and pull him to his feet]</i>
</p><p><br/>
<i>[Some time later, Stefan/Marty awakens in the passenger seat of the Camaro, and Damon looks relieved. However, when Stefan turns to face Damon, Damon seems a little unnerved by his brother's words coming out of Marty's mouth]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Damon...? What's wrong?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon shakes off his initial shock at seeing Stefan in his new/temporary vessel]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Nothing. It's all very normal.

</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Are those...?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[nods]</i> Cop-approved.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan wastes no time tearing into the box and shoving a doughnut into his mouth, moaning in pleasure at the first bit of food he's eaten since awakening in Marty's body]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Mmmmm... You asked me what I missed most about being human? The ecstasy of eating this... incredibly crappy doughnut.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon seems relieved by this response]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: So all's forgiven?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan shakes his head as he continues eating his doughnut]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Not by a long shot.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon nods, seemingly understanding this response, but he and Stefan both become concerned when Stefan suddenly groans. Blood drips profusely from his nose and lands on one of the doughnuts in his lap before Stefan reaches up with his hand to try to staunch the blood flow]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[confused]</i> What is that?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, remembering what Alaric told him about vampire souls that are improperly placed in human bodies]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: About that... I'm afraid Marty's not gonna make it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon gets a determined look on his face and turns back to the road as he accelerates]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Buckle up. We have less than 48 hours to track down your real body.

<dl><dd> ALARIC: Okay, we gotta go.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[confused]</i> Why? What's going on?

<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[frowns]</i> It's something that Rayna said. It reminded me of an old wives' tale about a string of murders that happened in the 1880s.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Alaric continues the story in voiceover as the scene cuts to the University of Memphis fraternity house (specifically Alpha Rho Tau), where "Stefan" is walking up to the door of the house with a six-pack of beer in his hands]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[voiceover] Apparently, he was a serial killer before he became a vampire. He would stalk sororities and fraternities and murder for sport.</i>

<p><i>[Stefan nods, and the camera pans down to his feet as he's able to cross the threshold after being invited in by the fraternity member. As he enters the house, he looks around at his new environment, taking note of how things have changed since the last time he was alive. On the staircase, another "frat bro" is chugging beer from a Solo cup, while a young couple makes out in a corner]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[voiceover] As the story goes, he wouldn't just kill. He would force his victims to murder each other.</i>

<p><i>["Stefan" smiles at the sight of two girls giggling and dancing with each other as he walks over to the fireplace and grabs a poker]</i>
</p>

<dl><dd> ALARIC: They never caught the killer.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie's eyes widen in horror at the thought of the chaos the vampire possessing Stefan's body could cause. Back at the U of M FRATERNITY HOUSE, "Stefan," thrilled to be back at his job as a serial killer, closes his eyes, lifts his hands in the air, and sighs in pleasure]</i>
