<p><i>[Stefan, still in his bloodstained gray shirt, is in the middle of packing another bag while Valerie argues with him about his plans]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Stefan, you can't go.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan throws his bag onto the couch before anxiously peeking out through the closed blinds over the window to make sure the mysterious huntress hasn't followed him. Once he's sure the coast is clear, he turns back to Valerie, who looks at him with worry]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: She has Damon <i>and</i> Caroline.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie gives him a frustrated look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Because she wants <i>you</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan returns to packing his bag, and throws in what look like several vervain bombs]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Well, then she's gonna get me. Oh, and I, uh, burned my Porsche, so I kind of need to borrow your car...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie walks over to him and stares at him intensely]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I'm coming with you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: No, you're not.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Stefan.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: She already has two people that I care about.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan sighs and walks closer to Valerie so he can caress her cheek with his hand. When he speaks again, his voice is even more gentle]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I'm not gonna let her have a third, okay?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie sighs in defeat, though she is visibly unhappy about having to stay behind and gives him a very serious look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: If anything happens to you, I will rain hell down on anyone responsible.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan smiles weakly at her before chuckling softly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Don't be so dramatic.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan leans forward and kisses Valerie softly for a long moment before he pulls away, sighing unhappily at the thought of leaving her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I'll be back before you know it.

<p><i>[Night has fallen at some point shortly after Lily's death, and Damon and Stefan are silently carrying Lily's coffin to the family plot where they have dug a hole to bury her. They join Nora and Valerie, the latter of whom has a bouquet of white flowers in her hands. Damon looks unimpressed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, this it? This the whole funeral party?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon looks directly at Nora]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Where's your girlfriend?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[uncomfortably]</i> Not your concern.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[amused]</i> Trouble in paradise?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What about Julian? Where is he?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora looks even more uncomfortable, though she gives them an unamused look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: I haven't heard from either of them in days. I sided with Lily, or did you forget?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie, feeling badly for Nora, cuts in before Damon can make any more comments]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: It's just us.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie looks over at the coffin holding Lily's deceased body]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Beau couldn't bring himself to say good-bye.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'm sure he just couldn't find the right words to say.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon chuckles at his own joke before walking toward Lily's casket to place it in her grave]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Heh. All right. Let's get her done.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Wait. We should say something.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> No, we shouldn't.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[appalled]</i> Yes, we should.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora walks over to Lily's grave and stands in front of it before making her eulogy]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: When I was a girl, I loved my mother deeply. She loved me, too, until she found out about my little siphoning problem. If she only knew that was just one of the things that made me different. When she turned her back on me, I thought I'd never find that kind of love again. You proved me wrong. Thank you, Lily.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora pauses before walking away, and Damon impatiently gestures for the others to get on with it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Next.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie walks over to the coffin to say her goodbye]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: You knew me at my brightest and my darkest. No matter what my mood, you always saw the light in me.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie reaches out and touches the wooden coffin lid with her hand]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I'll miss you, Lily.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie nervously holds up her small bouquet of white flowers, and Stefan smiles weakly at the gesture]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Cream violets. You remembered.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Of course I did.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Thank you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie walks over to join Nora]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: We'll leave you two.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The two Heretics walk away, leaving Damon to look expectantly at Stefan]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: How many times do you get a second chance to deliver your mother's eulogy?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Good point, brother. How's this? Ahem.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon clears his throat dramatically before leaning forward toward Lily's coffin]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Lily, you were a terrible mother when you were alive, and you were a terrible mother when you were dead.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon smiles and straightens up, looking over at a very unimpressed Stefan with a smirk]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You're right! It <i>does</i> feel good. Huh.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon walks away, leaving Stefan alone with Lily to say his final goodbye. He lifts the lid of the coffin and looks down at Lily's body, which is gray and desiccated from death. Her face still shows the ghost of her disappointment and hurt of Damon's final words]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I'm so sorry. I promise I'll make this right.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WHITMORE_COLLEGE_.2F_SUNBURY_STREET"> WHITMORE COLLEGE / SUNBURY STREET </span></h2>
<p><i>[Several weeks have passed since the funeral, and it's almost Christmas now. Caroline is wearing an elf's hat at her dorm at WHITMORE COLLEGE as she multitasks between talking to Stefan on the phone and organizing the school's Toys for Tots toy-drive. Stefan is walking down a SUNBURY STREET while he talks to her and waits for Damon to join him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Last year, we filled ten crates. This year, I am aiming for twenty.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You know, compelling people to donate doesn't actually count as donating...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline chooses to ignore this comment and instead rubs her belly, which has grown into a small baby bump in the time since she was last seen]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Wait 'til you see me. I popped this week. I have a pot belly.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Yeah? Put on a Santa hat, you'd fit right in here.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks around at all of the Sunbury residents who are celebrating the holidays by drinking and visiting the shops]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Sure you don't need me over there?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: To do what? Come to boring birthing classes? You're chasing after an immortal jerk who basically killed your mother. That's much more important. I can handle this...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline trails off and becomes distracted by a young college boy standing nearby. She becomes transfixed by the sight of his neck, and nearly starts to salivate as she watches his carotid artery throb as his blood pumps through his body]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Of course you can.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[After Caroline is silent for a long moment, Stefan becomes concerned]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Caroline? You still there?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline, realizing that she almost lost control of her bloodlust, looks panicked and ashamed as she shakes her head to break herself out of her trance and returns to her phone call]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Yes. Here. How are you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I'm good. I'd be a lot better if my traveling companion would actually stick to task instead of stopping by every single bar we pass by.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Damon appears behind them, carrying a beer stein full of bourbon and eggnog that has reindeer antlers attached to each side of the mug]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: It's a pub crawl, Stef! That's the whole point. Don't be such a Grinch, or you'll get coal in your stocking.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline, hearing Damon's complaints, rolls her eyes, just as Bonnie, wearing an elf's hat as well, approaches her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: : And <i>that's</i> my cue. I'll call you later.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie gives Caroline a teasing smile as she starts to put the wrapped toys into Santa Claus bags]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: "Hey, Stefan. Did I mention Bonnie saw me mix a blood bag with a jar of mayonnaise at 2:00 in the morning?"
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline blushes in embarrassment and starts to help Bonnie with the work]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Okay. One, that was marshmallow fluff, and, two, I'm feeding for three now, so I get cravings.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Fair. Why not just tell him?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Because he doesn't need to worry about the specifics of my magical pregnancy with Alaric's babies.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric appears behind them with a bemused expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Words that should <i>probably</i> not be spoken at that volume.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric looks over at Caroline]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: You ready to go to this class?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline takes off her elf hat before gathering up her study materials in preparation to leave with him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Now I am!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[confused]</i> You know it's a birthing class, right, Caroline, and not SAT prep?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline ignores him and turns to Bonnie, who has picked up Caroline's clipboard to lead the toy drive]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: You sure you can handle this on your own?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: If you can handle all of this while pregnant, I can handle a fraction of it while not. Go to your class.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline sighs and hands Alaric some of the study materials she collected]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: That was the least graphic one I could find. Study up.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric can't help but scoff at her as she walks away to go to the class, and he quickly follows after her as Bonnie gives him a sympathetic look]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SUNBURY_STREETS"> SUNBURY STREETS </span></h2>
<p><i>[Damon and Stefan are still walking down the streets of Sunbury as Damon continues to drink his mug of spiked eggnog]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: So what's it gonna be... Uncle Stefan? Unkie Stefy?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hmm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I got it! "Creepy Dude Who Hangs Out With Mom Who's Not Dad."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Ooh. See, the thing is, she's not their mom.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs loudly]</i> Oh, come on! It's <i>Caroline</i>. You think she's gonna turn those kids over to a functioning alcoholic with no supervision?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[shrugs]</i> Whatever she wants to do.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: So diplomatic. You're gonna make an amazing not-father. It's kind of your thing, isn't it, hmm?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What's that, Damon?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon holds up his hand and pinches his index finger and thumb together until there is only several centimeters between them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>Just barely</i> not being a father.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan just rolls his eyes, seemingly unbothered by Damon's glib remark]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Oh, wow. You know, in these last few weeks, your jokes, they've gotten quite sad.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon stops walking and looks Stefan in the eyes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You know what? You need me, little brother. Sucks for you, but Julian's almost 500 years old, and you ain't taking him alone--
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon reaches out and lifts up the lapel of Stefan's jacket, revealing that the inside of his coat has been packed full of anti-vampire weapons in preparation for a possible fight with Julian]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: --No matter how many vervain darts and stakes you have on you. Hmm?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What I need, Damon, is your actions, not your words.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Sounds like you should have brought Beau then. I'm here to help. Trust me. I got more vervain syringes and grenades strapped to my body. One wrong step, and I'm vampire shrapnel. Relax!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon holds up his mug and smirks]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Eggnog?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan shakes his head in exasperation]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SALVATORE_BOARDING_HOUSE"> SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Valerie has just quietly slipped into the Salvatore Boarding House, where she quickly looks around before trying her best to make it to her bedroom without running into anyone. Unfortunately for her, Mary Louise comes out behind her and stands in the middle of the hallway as she calls out to her with a cold expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Julian's not here... if that's what you're worried about.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Is he coming back?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: None of your concern.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I left a few things. I'll just grab them and be on my way.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie is about to leave to find her things when Mary Louise hesitantly speaks up again]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Have you seen her?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie, who realizes she's talking about Nora, frowns before she replies]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: We've spoken.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise seems upset by this and glares at her angrily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: This is your fault, you know. This <i>fracturing</i>?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie, unamused by Mary Louise's pettiness, rolls her eyes sarcastically]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Yeah. If only I hadn't fallen in love and placed my pregnant womb in front of Julian's boot...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[scoffs]</i> Sticking to your story, are you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: It's not a story.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise walks toward her with a menacing expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Even if by some stretch of the imagination it's not, the timing is <i>awfully suspect</i>, isn't it?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[annoyed]</i> What's <i>that</i> supposed to mean?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Well, you had over one hundred years to tell this story, and you only did once you were back in Stefan's life. 'Til it served you. Gained you sympathy.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie is visibly hurt by Mary Louise's words and scowls at her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: And I always thought <i>you</i> were the nice one, that you had a heart deep down. Guess I was wrong. Nora will <i>blossom</i> without you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie angrily turns and walks away, leaving a hurt Mary Louise behind to ponder what just happened]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WHITMORE_COLLEGE"> WHITMORE COLLEGE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Nora has just appeared at the toy drive and walks up to Bonnie with a gift in her hands. It's clear she wants to befriend Bonnie, but she's unsure of how to do so]</i>

<dl><dd> NORA: You appear tired.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie, visibly irritated, turns to Nora with a fake smile on her face]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Nora. How unexpected. What are you doing here?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: Uh, I have a toy... for a tot.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora holds out her toy, the board game Sorry!, and Bonnie gives her another mocking smile]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: You shouldn't have.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora shrugs bashfully]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: I didn't, actually. It was a passive aggressive gift for when Mary Louse came crawling back to me, but that hasn't happened, so...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[nods]</i> Still very generous of you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: I know.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie assumes that their exchange is now over, but when Nora doesn't leave, Bonnie's tone becomes more sarcastic]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Okay. You delivered it. Yay! That's the end.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora seems sad that she's been dismissed and frowns]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: But how will the tot know the toy's from me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I'll tell them.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora still remains where she's standing, and Bonnie gives Nora a look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: And you're <i>still</i> not leaving...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora seems nervous and hesitates for a moment before she replies]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: I want to be more involved. See, I recently enrolled in classes, and...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[surprised]</i> You're going to school here? Why?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: Because I was curious about college and, well... Mary Louise hated the idea, so...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[nods]</i> Spite. That's a good reason for higher education.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora looks frustrated that Bonnie isn't more open to attempts at bonding]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: Look, you clearly need help.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[scoffs]</i> Not from an evil Heretic who kidnapped my friend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: Are you going to let that old news get in the way of a little charity? And I'm not evil.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie sighs before pointing across the room]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Collection booth. The far one, like, way over there.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora looks at where Bonnie is pointing and starts to walk in that direction as Bonnie shoos her away]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Yeah. You see it? See?

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Just so we're clear, me helping you kill Julian is your Christmas present, so don't be expecting any socks or a TV or anything.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Yeah. Well, we got to find him to kill him.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: We will. Bonnie did the locator spell, and she said Sunbury. We're in Sunbury, so...

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Oops. I'm dry. Pit stop.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon and Stefan walk into the nearest bar, but as soon as they're through the threshold, they stop and gape in horror at what they see. The bar is full of Santa Claus impersonators, all of whom have been killed and are laying scattered across the room. Some are laying on the floor in pools of blood while others are bent face-first over the tables]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Merry Christmas, brother. Think we found him.

<p><i>[Stefan continues to stare in horror at the carnage]</i>
</p><p><br/>

<dl><dd> DAMON: Gonna be a lot of disappointed faces Christmas morning.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[irritably]</i> Yeah, well, maybe if we hadn't stopped at every single bar for eggnog, we could have done something about it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> Yeah, and maybe been two more bodies in this pile.

<p><i>[Stefan gives him another look, and Damon sighs]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: What I am saying is... maybe we should just take a little bit of a beat, you know? I mean, look around. Julian is <i>clearly</i> off the proverbial rails here.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What? Since when you do you think logically?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon waves at Stefan theatrically]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hi. I'm level-headed Damon. I only come out when Stefan goes a little cuckoo, and since you're letting your mommy and could-have-been-daddy issues drive you right now...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: So you don't think that Julian deserves to die?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I do! 100%. But not if it means <i>us</i> dying. So, I think we should just stop and think about some backup.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You <i>are</i> my backup. You're just terrible at it. And if Julian's off the rails, then good. It means he's careless. I mean, look at these wounds. They're fresh, which means he's obviously still in town, so either you help me find him, or...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Don't be so dramatic, Stefan. I got this.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon pulls out his phone and calls Bonnie, who is still working at the toy drive at WHITMORE COLLEGE]</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: What a lovely way to be greeted. "Hi, Bonnie. I need something."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, isn't it so great to feel loved and needed? So, Julian...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Yeah. I've already done a locator spell.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yes, yes, you did, which led us to this Santa-infested hell-hole. But is there, like, a way to do, like, a zoom-in spell, or something maybe a little more accurate? Like an address or...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: It doesn't work that way, Damon.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Right. Well, here's the deal, Bonnie. Stefan's here, and he's being kind of a crazy person. He's breathing down my neck, and I was just kind of hoping you might have some information for me, you know what I mean?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie looks across the room and sees Nora collecting toys from some donors and gets an idea]</i>

<dl><dd> BONNIE: Hmm. Actually, there might be something I can do.

</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Don't give me that look.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: What look?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: That is a "Your hormones are making you crazy because you are pregnant"- look, which I will have you know is really just a man's attempt to minimize the gift that our bodies bring into this world.

</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian holds up the sword so he can see that the Phoenix Stone has been affixed to the end of the handle]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: See, when a vampire is stabbed through the heart with, uh, the completed sword, it acts as a magical conduit, transferring their spirit into <i>this</i> particularly nasty stone. And the purpose of the stone is to punish vampires like you boys. Every sin you've committed goes into creating your own little personal hell. I spent over one hundred years inside.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian, nearly hysterical with grief and glee at the thought of torturing Stefan and Damon, laughs and blows a raspberry]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Pbbbt! One hundred. Then, Lily saved me. And for the briefest of moments, oh... I had her back in my life. So, she was the only thing that kept the madness of the stone at bay. You know, the only thing that kept me... <i>sane</i>.

</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: He was a painter-- terrible painter, though-- but a painter.

<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[confused]</i> What? What are you talking about? He's building a small army back there. He's obviously up to something.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> He's getting wasted with his friends! You're delusional. Trust me. That? That is a hornets' nest, and take it from an expert-- you do <i>not</i> want to kick it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You of all people should <i>not</i> be the one to give up! You're the reason he's alive and she isn't.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[appalled]</i> What kind of backwards-ass logic is that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Because we would have killed Julian the minute he showed up into our lives, but <i>no</i>. You wanted to punish Lily with a long-con, didn't you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> She punished herself with a short stake.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Huh. You know, for weeks, I've been watching you. I've been trying to catch even the slightest bit of regret on your face.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[exasperatedly]</i> Regret for <i>what</i>, Stefan?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: She was <i>dying</i>, Damon? How difficult would it have been to say something nice?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, I didn't want to lie to the woman.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: All she wanted was forgiveness, and you practically spat in her face!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: She didn't deserve my forgiveness.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What, because she made some mistakes? Or is it because she didn't choose poor you over Valerie?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon is clearly offended and hurt by Stefan's words, but he just smiles coldly at Stefan]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Giving her a hall pass, like always. Her little angel.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You acted like a spoiled little brat. A <i>coward</i>. You had a chance to make things right, and you still do.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, no longer willing to play this game, glares at Stefan angrily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Road trip's over, brother. You want to go back and risk it? Go for it. I'm going home.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon walks away, leaving a frustrated Stefan behind in the alley]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SALVATORE_BOARDING_HOUSE_.2F_ON_THE_ROAD"> SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE / ON THE ROAD </span></h2>
<p><i>[Outside the SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE, Valerie is packing her bags of belongings into her car, including Stefan's leather-bound journal from 1863 that she brought back from the prison world. She looks at it sadly for a moment before her phone rings, and she pulls it out of her pocket to answer it and finds that Stefan is calling her from his car on the way back to Mystic Falls]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Please tell me this is the "Julian is dead" call.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I wish. I'm headed home. Damon bailed on me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[sighs]</i> And here I was looking forward to leaving all this behind me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: He thinks I'm overreacting.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>Any</i> reaction is appropriate when it comes to what he's done to us. I am <i>sick</i> of everyone giving this monster a pass!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie sighs again, looking upset]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I should have gone with you. We could have ended this.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: We still can. Have you seen Mary Louise?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie realizes what he's suggesting]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SCULL_BAR"> SCULL BAR </span></h2>
<p><i>[Mary Louise is sitting at the empty Scull Bar, which has been decorated with Christmas lights and decorations. However, all of the chairs stacked up on the tables indicates that the bar has been closed for the holidays. She downs a glass of bourbon and scowls for a moment before drunkenly yelling at no one]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: I've been here all day. You'd think that would earn me better service!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Stefan appears in the doorway next to the bar and smiles mockingly at her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I think you've had enough.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[groans]</i> You have <i>no</i> idea how poor your timing is.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You sure about that? You look like you could use a friend. Things with Nora didn't quite work out, did they?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[coldly]</i> I would hold your tongue if you value its existence.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[smirks]</i> And I would not make threats when there's a cloaked Heretic behind you...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise looks confused for a moment, and before she can react, Valerie releases the cloaking spell and appears behind her as she jams a syringe full of vervain in her neck, knocking her out instantly. Valerie looks satisfied as she smiles at Stefan]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Payback's a bitch.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Stay with her and make sure she's unconscious until Julian's dead.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie nods as Stefan leaves to continue his plan, though she does look worried]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="BONNIE_AND_CAROLINE.27S_DORM_ROOM"> BONNIE AND CAROLINE'S DORM ROOM </span></h2>
<p><i>[Bonnie returns to her room after the toy drive to find a crying Nora sitting on her bed. She looks surprised for a moment before giving the Heretic a sympathetic look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Guess it didn't go well...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: She called me a charity case.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie takes in the tears trailing down Nora's cheeks and tries to comfort her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Why don't I get you a tissue?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora holds up a bundle of cloth in her hands]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: Oh, it's all right. I used one of your hideous tops.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[chuckles]</i> Which is now <i>your</i> hideous top.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie sits down next to Nora on the bed and looks at her for a moment before speaking]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Can I ask you what might seem like a mean question?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[shrugs]</i> Fire away. It's not like I'm in a fragile state or anything.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[sighs]</i> What do you see in her? Aside from the fact that she looks like a blonde Angelina Jolie?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora laughs weakly at this comment]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: She's loving, protective, kind...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: But just to you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[nods]</i> That's fair. She does always think of me first. Maybe I'm spoiled, or old-fashioned, but it's nice having that one person who doesn't need anything from you. Who just loves you and thinks you're the most amazing, beautiful girl in the whole world, you know?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie seems to disagree with this remark, but smiles anyway, and Nora suddenly becomes self-conscious]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: Maybe... Maybe you don't.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I don't need someone to tell me I'm pretty.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[smiles]</i> Nobody <i>needs</i> it. That doesn't mean it doesn't feel good to hear it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie smiles at her affectionately, and Nora seems genuinely touched by her sympathetic reaction. It almost looks as though Nora is starting to develop feelings for Bonnie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: Thank you for today. You're a very kind person, and... beautiful. Even if you do wear hideous tops.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie and Nora both giggle and smile at each other as Nora stands to leave. However, before she makes it to the door, Nora's phone buzzes, and she checks it to find a text message from Julian that reads, "They've taken ML hostage. Thought you should know." Nora's eyes widen in horror, and she turns to look at Bonnie with a betrayed expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: I guess I was wrong.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie, who has no knowledge of Stefan's plan, nor did she play any part in it, looks at her in confusion]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: What?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: You and your friends are not kind at all.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie stands to her feet to try to figure out what is going on, but Nora roughly grabs Bonnie by the arm and siphons her magic until she falls unconscious onto the floor]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SALVATORE_BOARDING_HOUSE_2"> SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Damon is standing in front of the fireplace in his old bedroom, where he's burning what appears to be Lily's clothing in the roaring fire as he reclaims the room for himself. After a moment, a very unhappy Julian walks into the room]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: I'm sure there are places that would have loved those as a donation.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sarcastically]</i> Back so soon?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: That tends to happen when I'm threatened. Where is she?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon frowns in confusion and turns to face Julian]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'm not exactly sure who "she" is.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian's tone and expression only become colder, assuming that Damon is involved in Stefan's plans]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Don't play dumb. I got your brother's text message. I was told to come alone. I am here alone. Now, where is Mary Louise?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon's eyes widen in shock as he realizes what is going on]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Stefan kidnapped Mary Louise? Ballsy.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: I just spent two hours crammed in a small metal tube, flying across the country to be here. It was hell.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hmm.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian takes the Phoenix-Stone-clad sword and aims it at Damon's heart]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: But that is just a <i>fraction</i> of the hell that this sword will put you in if I don't get her back.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon sighs in frustration before addressing Julian with a fake-nice tone]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Look, Jules. You and I, we got no beef, okay? You didn't kill my baby, and I don't blame you for Lily's death. It was her own stupid fault.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: <i>[angrily]</i> Kindly do not speak that way about your mother.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Let's just stick with "Lily." Mother's incidental.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Right. I forgot. You don't care about your mother. Look at you not caring as you burn her clothes, attempting to erase every trace of her existence.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I needed space in my closet.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: See, I always knew that her love for you would get her killed. It was toxic.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No. It was nonexistent.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Heh. It's easier for you to think that way, isn't it? Because then you don't have to take any responsibility for her death.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: She killed herself.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Because she couldn't turn her back on you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[unamused]</i> Funny, because I would have had no problem turning mine on her.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian angrily vamp-speeds toward Damon, shoving him backward onto the floor and aiming the sword at Damon's heart as he grimaces in fear and defeat]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: I don't know what your hell will be, but I hope she's there.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Before Julian can stab Damon, Stefan vamp-speeds into the room and shoves Julian away from him, saving his brother at the last moment. Stefan glares at Julian, who vamp-speeds out the door before anything else can happen]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="MYSTIC_FALLS_CEMETERY"> MYSTIC FALLS CEMETERY </span></h2>
<p><i>[Caroline has brought flowers to her mother's grave at the cemetery, and she stops for a moment before she speaks to it as though Liz is there with her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Hi, Mom. I just realized that this is going to be my first Christmas without you. That <i>sucks</i>. I still got you something. Two somethings actually. I will spare you the details of how, because honestly? I am sick of talking about it. But it's happening. I'm pregnant. I used to picture us having this conversation. It looked different, obviously. I was a human carrying my own children, and you... were... you were alive. I know they're not mine... But they're still my responsibility, you know? And I want to... I <i>have</i> to do this right. And I have no idea what I'm doing. And all I want to do is just sit on our kitchen counter while you burn our dinner and ask you a million questions.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline's eyes fill with tears, and she pauses for a moment before sighing loudly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: God, I miss you.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SALVATORE_BOARDING_HOUSE_3"> SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Stefan and Damon walk downstairs to the parlor to find Julian standing in front of the lit fireplace there. They both glare at him angrily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Thought you ran away.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Heh heh heh. In my own house? I'm twice your age. I could take both of you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, you could certainly try.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon picks up a ceramic vase from the table and throws it at Julian at vampire speed, but Julian uses the sword to smash it before it can hit him. Julian vamp-speeds toward Stefan and shoves him across the room, causing him to fly over a table and shatter the glass dishes on top of it. Damon angrily shoves Julian against the fireplace mantle and holds a knife to his neck, but Julian uses his strength to turn the blade on Damon. He then snaps Damon's forearm and head-butts him in the face]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Aah!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian head-butts him three more times in quick succession until Damon's nose is gushing blood, and though Damon punches Julian in the face through his daze, Julian easily kicks him backward onto the floor and flips his sword in his hand to prepare to stab Damon with it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: I would have killed you on sight if it weren't for your mother. I respected her.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian hits Damon in the back of the head with the hilt of the blade, knocking him on his face on the floor. However, Stefan once again rushes toward Julian and shoves him away from Damon before he can hurt him. He then throws a vervain dart at Julian, which embeds itself into his neck]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Clearly the feeling wasn't mutual.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan pulls out a small stake and lunges for Julian, who stabs Stefan in the stomach with a broken piece of wood from the table. Damon, afraid that Julian killed him, shouts out to him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[groans]</i> Unh!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Stefan!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When Damon manages to get to his feet and vamp-speed toward Julian, Julian stabs him in the heart with the Phoenix Sword, which starts to glow from within as his soul is trapped inside. Stefan, still recovering from his stake wound, yells out in fury]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: No!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian smirks at Stefan]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Now I'll run.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian vamp-speeds out of the house, and Stefan stumbles over to check on Damon, whose body is motionless, though it is not desiccated like most "dead" vampires]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Damon?
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WHITMORE_MEDICAL_CENTER_3"> WHITMORE MEDICAL CENTER </span></h2>
<p><i>[Valerie has taken Mary Louise to the room currently under construction at the hospital where Damon, Alaric, and Bonnie kept Oscar earlier in the season. Mary Louise is laying on an autopsy table in the middle of the room as Valerie paces around in the doorway. After a moment, Valerie hears a whooshing noise and immediately walks away to investigate it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Who's there?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie walks back into the main room, only to find that Mary Louise's body has completely vanished, presumably by Nora. She looks horrified as she looks around the room]</i>
</p>

<p><i>[Caroline has just arrived to the SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE and walks into the parlor to find a distraught Stefan kneeling over Damon's motionless body, gaping in horror at the sight]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Oh my God.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[numbly]</i> Damon wanted me to let it go. I should have let it go. I couldn't...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline sighs and gives him a sympathetic look as she walks toward him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: She was your mom, Stefan. And if you think it's easy to let something like that go, take it from a girl who just got back from her mom's grave, it's... it's not. Let's figure out a way to save your brother.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
<i>[The scene cuts to moments later, as Caroline calls Bonnie. At BONNIE AND CAROLINE'S DORM, Bonnie's phone starts to buzz on the floor next to Bonnie, who still lays unconscious there from Nora's attack. She slowly begins to stir, but is still too weak and confused to answer her phone. Back at the BOARDING HOUSE, Caroline groans in frustration and hangs up her phone and returns to Stefan, who still looks devastated]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Oh, she's not answering. We need to call Valerie.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan remains silent, and Caroline looks even more concerned]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Stefan?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: He's not gonna make it in there.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Yes, he will.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: That stone is punishment for every bad thing you've ever done. This is Damon. I don't even want to know what he's going through.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The camera zooms in close to Damon's still-bloody face before we're transported to inside the PHOENIX STONE, in Damon's personal hellscape. It is the Civil War, and Damon is still a 24-year-old human man serving in the Confederate Army. Exploding shells and gunfire are ringing through the woods, and soldier after soldier falls as they're hit with bullets and shrapnel. Damon is laying flat on his back on the floor of the forest, where a large bloody wound on his stomach is staining his uniform. Damon suddenly comes to and groans in pain as he tries to figure out where he is and how he got here. He rolls over on his side and watches as several soldiers hiding behind trees get shot down. Despite his wounds, he stumbles to his feet and looks around as landmines explode around him, shaking in fear and watching the chaos around him in horror]</i>
</p><p><i>[Back at the SALVATORE BOARDING HOUSE, Caroline and Stefan continue their conversation]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Hey. He can survive this.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Nora, who was cloaked and has been standing with them for an unknown amount of time, appears out of nowhere with the Phoenix Sword in her hands and looks at Stefan]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: Even if he can, he'll be different... Just like you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora quickly vamp-speeds toward Stefan and stabs him in the heart with the sword as Caroline gasps in horror]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Unh!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Stefan!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan grabs the hilt of the sword and falls backward against the nearby armchair, and Nora and Caroline watch as Stefan's soul is sucked into the now-glowing Phoenix Stone]</i>
