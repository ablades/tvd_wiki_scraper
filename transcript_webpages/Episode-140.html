<p><i>[Damon is speeding in his car on the highway with Alaric riding in the passenger seat. They're on their way to the KQBC Channel 3 news station to make sure Caroline is alright after the events of the <a href="/wiki/Best_Served_Cold/Transcript" title="Best Served Cold/Transcript">previous episode's</a> flash-forward, where Caroline was forced by the mysterious huntress to go live on the news channel to give a message to Stefan. Alaric looks down at his wristwatch with a panicked expression as Damon exceeds 80 miles per hour]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Twenty-three minutes.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Just enough time for me to get in, take out little Miss Stabby-Pants, and grab Caroline.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[incredulously]</i> That's it? That's your plan? Just take her out?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: It's simple. It's classic. Come on!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Yeah. Listen. I saw the "X" carved in Stefan's chest. Pretty sure she's not playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon scoffs at Alaric, who gives him a serious look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Look. This is a trap.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON; Oh, I know it's a trap, and I'm gonna spring it so Stefan can't.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Yeah. Well, look-- I didn't get a babysitter on thirty seconds notice just to sit in the car.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[exasperatedly]</i> You're not gonna just sit in the car!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[quickly]</i> Turn, turn, turn, turn.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon sharply takes the turn Alaric has indicated, and Alaric has to hold onto the door to stay upright as they slide into the back parking lot of the news station]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: There's no way Stefan didn't see Caroline's broadcast. He'll be here in a minute. When he gets here, pump him full of vervain so he can't hero his way in there.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[insistently]</i> If Caroline's in danger, I'm coming with you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: She doesn't want <i>Caroline</i>. She wants <i>him</i>! If he goes in there, he's dead.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric sighs in defeat as Damon quickly gets out of his Camaro and heads into the station. Once he's through the door, he walks carefully, clearly on edge that the huntress could attack. He looks concerned when he suddenly hears Caroline's pleading voice coming from the next room]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[voiceover]</i> Stefan? Stefan, please.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[quietly]</i> Guess you're gonna have to settle for the other one, Blondie.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[voiceover]</i> Stefan, I...
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon walks into the main stage and is horrified when he finds that Caroline is not actually here at all. Instead, what he has been hearing is a video recording of Caroline that is being played on every television screen in the room. As soon as Damon walks in, the recording starts from the beginning, which is the part that Alaric and Damon saw in the previous episode]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[video recording]</i> We apologize for the interruption to your current program. My name is Caroline.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[stunned]</i> Well, that's not good...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Before he can do something, the mysterious huntress shoots him with four vervain darts that causes him to fall on the floor unconscious.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[video recording]</i> Please listen carefully. I have an urgent message for Stefan Salvatore.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="PRESENT_DAY--_CAROLINE.27S_AND_BONNIE.27S_DORM_ROOM"> PRESENT DAY-- CAROLINE'S AND BONNIE'S DORM ROOM </span></h2>
<p><i>[Caroline is sitting on her bed with a pregnancy test in her hand, which she has apparently just taken off-screen. Meanwhile, Alaric walks over to sit on Elena's old bed, looking nervous. Alaric tries his best to cheer Caroline up, but it's obvious she's also anxious as well]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Well, simple enough. Two lines you're pregnant, one line you're not.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: And how many lines if you've been mystically knocked up by a coven of dead witches?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[smiles sheepishly]</i> Guess we'll find out in three minutes.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline sighs loudly in disbelief]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: This is crazy! I mean, you're an occult studies professor. Have you <i>ever</i> come across anything about a pregnant vampire?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric's smile fades slightly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: No. But until a few weeks ago, I'd never heard of a stone that was full of tormented vampire souls, either.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: But how would it even be possible? I'm technically <i>dead</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[hesitantly]</i> Well, your body basically functions normally. Your heart beats. You breathe. I mean, is it that far outside the realm of possibility that your body could support a baby or two?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[confused]</i> Why would the coven want me to?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: I don't think they had a choice. The Gemini were all dying. They couldn't let the future of their coven perish along with them, so they had to put the babies someplace safe, inside a body that... that wouldn't die.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline is clearly overwhelmed by the possibility that she's pregnant as she looks at the pregnancy test in her hand]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="LOCKWOOD_MANSION"> LOCKWOOD MANSION </span></h2>
<p><i>[Stefan is in the middle of grabbing several glasses and a decanter of bourbon in the late Mayor Lockwood's study when Damon walks in with a confused expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Is that cornbread I smell?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[smiles]</i> We're hosting Thanksgiving!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[snidely]</i> Thanksgiving's <i>tomorrow</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[shrugs]</i> Well, pre-Thanksgiving. Whatever.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Whatever happened to taking out Julian? Remember him? Killed what would have been your firstborn? You know, I cleared out my entire schedule so we could make that guy count worms... Unless you're too busy baking.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[sighs]</i> Julian knows that I want him dead, so our next move needs to be smart. We're probably only gonna have one more shot at this.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[frowns]</i> Not quite following the whole Martha Stewart strategy, to be honest...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[smiles]</i> I am planning on recruiting an ally.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, the doorbell rings, which makes Damon even more confused. He walks out into the foyer and scowls in displeasure when he opens the door to reveal that Lily is standing on the doorstep with a large Tupperware container in her hands. She smiles awkwardly at him before holding out the container]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: I brought cranberries!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, confused, steps backward so Lily can walk through the foyer into the kitchen. Stefan appears behind him and smiles smugly, causing Damon to gesture toward him and give him a look that says, "Are you kidding me??"]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="CAROLINE_AND_BONNIE.27S_DORM_ROOM_.2F_MYSTIC_GRILL"> CAROLINE AND BONNIE'S DORM ROOM / MYSTIC GRILL </span></h2>
<p><i>[The timer Alaric has set on his phone goes off, and Caroline takes a deep breath before looking down at the pregnancy test in her hand. She frowns when she sees the results, which makes Alaric anxious]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Negative. I don't understand. I mean, Valerie was <i>so</i> certain.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Well, I guess she was wrong, or playing some twisted game. Either way, I trust <i>that</i> a lot more than I trust her.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline gestures toward the test in Alaric's hands, but when she sees how visibly devastated she is, she sighs and looks at him with sympathy]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: And I'm <i>really</i> sorry. I know how much you wanted this.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric nods and rubs Caroline's back affectionately just as Caroline's phone buzzes. She pulls it out and politely turns away from Alaric to answer it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Hey, Matt... Now's not really a good time.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt, in his deputy's uniform, gets out of his police cruiser and starts walking toward the MYSTIC GRILL as he talks to Caroline on the phone]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Bonnie and I found <i>two dozen people</i> compelled to hang out at the high school last night. I've been trying to call her, but she won't pick up. I'm starting to get a little worried.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[frowns]</i> I think she's with Enzo.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[shocked]</i> What? Well, now I'm a <i>lot</i> worried. What the hell is she doing with him?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline shakes her head, clearly distracted by the baby situation]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: I don't know. Were you able to clear them out?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: We had to tranquilize them just to get them out of there, but they were all back this morning like they never left.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[confused]</i> Why would someone compel people to gather at the high school in an abandoned town?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt walks into the Grill and immediately stops dead in his tracks when he sees that each of the tables are full of silent and motionless compelled humans, who, like the ones at the high school, have been hooked up to IV drips as well]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[worriedly]</i> Matt? Matt?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[horrified]</i> Hey, Care. How fast can you get to the grill?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline sighs defeatedly as Alaric watches her with concern]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="LOCKWOOD_MANSION.C2.A0"> LOCKWOOD MANSION </span></h2>
<p><i>[Lily is seated in an armchair in front of the coffee table in the late Mayor Lockwood's study while Stefan and Damon sit across from her on the leather couch. On the table is a decanter of bourbon and three glasses. Lily looks at her sons warily, and after a moment, Stefan decides to begin his spiel]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I invited you over here because we can't keep doing this. I mean, I... I want us all to start over.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[smiles]</i> Well, uh, if the Pilgrims and Indians could do it, I'm sure there's hope for us.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sarcastically]</i> We call them Native Americans now, but we didn't bring you here to correct your outdated racial slurs.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon gives Stefan a pointed look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Did we, Stefan?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan ignores Damon's snide comments and continues to look at Lily]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I want to convince you of all the reasons that you need to help us get rid of Julian.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, surprised at the tactics Stefan is using, leans forward to listen intently to what comes next. Lily, however, looks confused, and chuckles nervously]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: I'm sorry. Is this some kind of set-up?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[insistently]</i> Just hear me out for a second. In 1863... I got Valerie pregnant.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily's eyes widen in shock at this confession]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: She kept it a secret from me, from you, from everyone. And Julian found out about it somehow, and he felt threatened by it. He beat her until the baby was no longer alive.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily blinks in confusion and frowns as she processes this information]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Her child-- <i>your grandchild</i>-- was <i>murdered</i> by Julian. She swore me to secrecy, but the truth is too important. You need to know what kind of man he is.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, visibly uncomfortable by the tension in the room, pipes up with a snarky comment]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: What I think Stefan's trying to say is... you have <i>really</i> crappy taste.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily is clearly overwhelmed by what she's just learned, and she pauses for a moment before she looks Stefan in the eyes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[quietly]</i> My son... Valerie <i>lied</i> to me for over a century about you. Then she tried to kill a member of my family in cold blood and tried to incinerate the love of my life. Do yourself a favor. Don't lose any more sleep over the words that come out of that poor girl's mouth.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks disappointed but not surprised by his mother's reaction, and nods awkwardly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Wow. I guess the joke's on me then, right? I mean, I was the idiot who believed her.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan picks up the decanter and pours the three of them a drink, and Damon looks at him with exasperation, mistakenly believing that Stefan believes what Lily is saying]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: I did, too... about <i>many</i> things. But I will <i>not</i> make that same mistake again.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Here's to moving on then, right?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan stands to his feet, and Lily eagerly does as well, also believing that Stefan is on her side about this. Damon rolls his eyes before standing and joining them with a glass in hand]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[smiles]</i> To moving on.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily is the first to drink, though Stefan makes it looks like he is drinking as well, and she swallows the entire glass of liquor before realizing that her lips, mouth, and throat are sizzling and burning]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Ugh!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, Lily collapses onto the floor, and Damon looks at Stefan with a shocked expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Concentrated vervain.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[impressed]</i> Wow! Did I ever mention I like your style?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I had a feeling we were gonna have to do this the hard way...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon looks down at Lily's unconscious body gleefully]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Best... Thanksgiving... ever!

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="MIDLOTHIAN_COUNTY_IMPOUND"> MIDLOTHIAN COUNTY IMPOUND </span></h2>
<p><i>[Bonnie and Enzo are walking around an old junkyard, where they are walking through rows of old and abandoned cars, some of which are badly smashed up. Bonnie has a piece of paper in her hand with the license plate number of Oscar's car as the two work on trying to find it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[skeptically]</i> Why would a centuries-old vampire with a bunch of witch groupies be so desperate to find <i>anything</i> collecting dust in the Midlothian County impound? Seems a little beneath him.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[shrugs]</i> Well, if Julian wants it, then so do I.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie gives him an incredulous look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Are we talking about Oscar's car, or Lily?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo, knowing that she's got a point, says nothing]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: You're not doing this to stop a psychopath. You just want the girl.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[sarcastically]</i> Congratulations. You've just unlocked <i>every man's</i> true motivation in life.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Let me give you some advice. Stop treating Lily like some prize to be won.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[scoffs]</i> Spoken like somebody who's never been fought over.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[rolls her eyes]</i> It's not the turn-on you think it is. Try flowers. A quiet dinner. <i>Listening</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo chuckles in amusement, and Bonnie stops walking when she sees a yellow car with a smashed back window that has the correct license plate they're looking for]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Found it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo wrinkles his nose in distaste]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Well, I'm assuming Julian doesn't want it for it's Bluebook value.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He takes a deep breath as he walks toward the car's trunk]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Charming.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo opens up the trunk to find that it is full of empty beer bottles and several bottles of automobile oil. Bonnie watches as Enzo lifts the carpeting covering the spare tire compartment and pulls out the tire, revealing a long object wrapped in a dirty cloth. When Enzo picks it up and unravels it, he finds a silver shortsword inside of it. The end of the blade is in the shape of an X, and Enzo examines it closely]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: I'll wager this is what Julian's looking for. Wonder what makes it so special?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie's eyes widen, and it appears that she recognizes the sword]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I think I've seen that before... when I was doing research on the stone. Let me see what I can dig up.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie grabs the sword and tries to take it from him, but Enzo yanks it back]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: No. I don't need research to tell me which one's the pointy end. What do we need to know?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[annoyed]</i> If he wants to <i>kill</i> someone with it, or he's worried about being killed <i>by</i> it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Well, there's one way to find out-- ram it through his chest. See what happens.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie smiles fakely at him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I know what's <i>not</i> gonna happen-- Lily falling hopelessly in love with the person who murdered her sweetheart.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Not if I make it look like self-defense.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[mockingly]</i> Good idea! Go pick a fight with an extremely powerful, unhinged ancient vampire! Should work out <i>great</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo, amused by their banter, smirks at Bonnie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Is that a hint of concern for me I detect in your voice?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie rolls her eyes, though she seems to be enjoying the banter just as much. She playfully shoves the sword against his chest]</i>

<dl><dd> MATT: I found more at the courthouse and another dozen at the supermarket.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: What's with all the IVs?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: Saline... to keep them hydrated. Which you'd only need if you were gonna keep them here for a while.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline stops in front of a woman who is sitting motionless in her chair. She leans forward to look at the woman in the eyes before waving her hand in front of her face, which elicits no response from the woman]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: They're using them as human blood banks.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline sighs and turns back to Matt, both of whom look concerned about what they've discovered]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: I guess we know what the Heretics are having for Thanksgiving dinner.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: Problem is I can't find a single bite mark on any of them, which is somehow creepier. They're not being fed on. They're being <i>fed</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt turns toward the nearby table, which is covered in take-out containers]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: I found these in the trashcan. This is salmon, steak. Iron-rich foods-- probably to boost their red blood cell count. It's like someone's fattening the cattle for the slaughter.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline looks horrified by this statement, and after a moment, she gags and covers her mouth before rushing over to the nearby trashcan and throwing up in it. Matt looks worried and surprised to see her so sick and walks over to her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Whoa, Care. Hey. Um... Are you okay?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline, looking a little shaky, leans against the trashcan with one hand while she wipes her mouth with the other hand, trying to hide how woozy and scared she is]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Yeah, I'm fine.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[suspiciously]</i> No, you're not fine. You just <i>puked</i>.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline finally musters up the strength to stand up and turn to look at him, though she's still pretty out of it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: I... I think I had an expired blood bag last night or something. You know, and then the talk of the food and the iron and the slaughtered cattle...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Looking as though she's about to throw up again, Caroline closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. Matt gives her a look that indicates he definitely doesn't believe her story]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: ...So you're a vampire with food poisoning?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[irritably]</i> Yes, Matt, I am a vampire with food poisoning, standing in a room of much bigger problems. So stop looking at me like you've never seen a vampire vomit before and start thinking of a way to break their compulsion.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[sighs]</i> Short of turning them into vampires, I can't think of a way to break their compulsion.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE Well, maybe we don't have to break it.

</p>

</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I am <i>all</i> for scuttling Julian's plans, but siphoning these people won't make a difference. He'll just replace them. You'd be trading one life for another.

<p><i>[Enzo remains silent, so Julian continues talking]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Most people don't. It isn't going against incredible odds and thinking you're going to win. No, that's merely confidence. Bravery is knowing you're going to lose, but doing it anyway.

He notices blood on a stone on the ground next to a headstone and touches it with his fingertips before realizing Julian is nearby. He stands to his feet and spins around to see Julian behind him, giving him just enough time to duck out of the way as Julian lunges for him]</i>

<p><i>[Enzo parries his blows and vamp-speeds toward him, shoving him against a tree, but when he tries to stab Julian, the ancient vampire just smirks and shoves Enzo several yards away into another tree. Enzo hits it so hard that the longer sword is knocked out of his hands, and his eyes widen in alarm as Julian pins him to the tree by the throat with his forearm]</i>

<p><i>[It's late at night, and Lily quietly slips into the dining room with a lit candle. She gently opens the glass door to one of the bookshelves and pulls out a greenish-brown book. She quickly takes a look around to ensure that no one will catch her before setting the candle on the table and examining the book. However, when she opens it, she searches the pages for something and becomes horrified when she's unable to find it. In her panic, she tries to search through all of the books on the shelf when she suddenly hears Giuseppe's voice from the doorway]</i>

<dl><dd> GIUSEPPE: Train tickets. Three of them.

<dl><dd> GIUSEPPE: Planning a trip, are we?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily thinks quickly before trying to lie her way out of it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Oh, Giuseppe, you ruined all my fun. I thought it could be a surprise. I... I thought you could take the boys to New York for a weekend and see that new steamship we read about in the paper.

<dl><dd> GIUSEPPE: You took that money, and I punished Damon for your duplicity, and you tried to steal my children from me. Should you ever attempt that again, I will take the boys far away from here. You will be alone, and you will never see them again. Do you understand me?

Enzo attempts to fight his way out, but Julian knocks his sword out of his hands, giving him no choice but to hold his hands up in a defensive position. Just as Julian is about to make the killing blow by beheading Enzo, Damon appears out of nowhere and shoves Julian against a nearby tree at vampire speed, pinning him against it by the throat with his forearm so hard that it snaps his neck and causes him to fall to the ground. Damon walks over and picks up the shortsword where Enzo dropped it before looking at Enzo incredulously]</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Wait. Back up. What are you talking about, linked himself to your mom?

</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Damon, tell me you did not just kill Lily.

<p><i>[Caroline rolls her eyes and scoffs in frustration]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Ugh! Isn't it possible that "Kill the psycho" and "Save the babies" just sound similar in Witch-Latin? Not to mention that you've been out of their loop for, like, one hundred years...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie looks hurt by this remark]</i>

<p><i>[Valerie hesitates for a moment before she responds]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Because I've used it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline's eyes widen in shock as Valerie continues]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I was pregnant before I turned. Julian knew that if Lily found out, it would ruin his plans with her. She would want to return to Mystic Falls instead. So, he promptly ended it. But I did everything in my power to save the life inside me.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline's face softens, and she looks at Valerie with sympathy as the Heretic chuckles bitterly]</i>

<dl><dd> VALERIE: I didn't have an entire coven to work with... It was just me. Hard as I tried, I wasn't strong enough.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline looks sad for her, though she is confused about one fact]</i>
</p>

</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Oh. That's the big secret that you have with Stefan.

<p><i>[Lily returns to the present with Julian, and once again repeats the words she's said many times before]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: Of course.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian comes up behind her and gently grabs her wrist to help her to her feet]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Come here.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Lily stands and turns so her face is close to his, but she can't bring herself to make eye contact with him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Look at me.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He gently cups her face and moves her head so that she's forced to look him in the eyes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: I love you, darling. I will <i>never</i> hurt you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian wraps his arms around her in a hug, which she returns, but it is obvious by the look on her face that she's realizing the kind of man Julian is]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WHITMORE_MEDICAL_CENTER"> WHITMORE MEDICAL CENTER </span></h2>
<p><i>[Caroline and Alaric are in an exam room, where an OB/GYN is performing an ultrasound on Caroline]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OB/GYN: How far along are you?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline, alarmed, looks up at Alaric, who quickly answers her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Uh, I'm not really sure how to answer that.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> OB/GYN: <i>[smiles]</i> Okay. Let's see what we can see.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline takes a deep breath as the doctor moves the ultrasound wand over Caroline's abdomen. After a moment, she frowns]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OB/GYN: And you're <i>sure</i> you're pregnant?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline immediately looks over at the screen]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Why? What's wrong?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> OB/GYN: <i>[hesitantly]</i> Well, I'm not seeing one baby, let alone two.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline and Alaric both focus on the screen in hopes of seeing something she didn't]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: And you're absolutely sure?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The doctor gives her a gentle smile]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OB/GYN: Twins would be hard to miss. I'm not hearing any heartbeats either.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When the doctor sees how disappointed Caroline and Alaric are, she looks at them sympathetically]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> OB/GYN: I'm not hearing any heartbeats, either. I'm sorry if you were informed otherwise. I'll give you some time alone.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The doctor gives them another look before leaving the room. Caroline looks over at Alaric with concern]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: I'm <i>so</i> sorry.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: No, <i>I'm</i> sorry... that I've been so desperate to believe this was actually possible. I, uh... I, um... I'm really sorry that I put you through all this.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[gently]</i> Honestly? For a second there, I believed it, too.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Valerie slips into the room]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[awkwardly]</i> I, um, saw the doctor leave.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[disappointedly]</i> She just told us you were wrong.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie gives Caroline a tiny smile]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Are you sure about that?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie puts her hand on Caroline's stomach, and it starts to glow red as she siphons away magic. Caroline looks at her in alarm]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: What are you doing?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie continues siphoning for another moment until Caroline seems to sense something and comes to a realization]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[whispers]</i> Oh, my God.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline looks at Alaric for a moment before she quickly grabs the ultrasound wand and puts it back on her stomach. Alaric frowns in confusion, not understanding what she's doing]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: ...I'm not sure you're qualified to use that...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Just let her.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline continues to try to find the babies with the ultrasound wand as Valerie explains]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: You know, it never made any sense to me. The spell pointed directly at you, but the tests came up negative. And then, it hit me-- I cloaked you from Beau to protect you. Alaric's babies are the future of the coven. They would have protected them in any way they could.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric is completely overwhelmed by this information]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Wait, wait-- how is this all possible?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie, seeing something on the ultrasound screen, smiles in wonder]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: They were cloaked.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The three of them look at the screen to find both babies are inside of Caroline's womb, and their heartbeats become audible as well. Caroline and Valerie both look as though they're in awe, while Alaric can't believe what he's seeing]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="LOCKWOOD_MANSION_6"> LOCKWOOD MANSION </span></h2>
<p><i>[A knock is heard at the front door, and Damon walks over to answer it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Yeah, yeah, yeah...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon opens the door and is shocked to find that Lily is standing on the front porch once again. He scowls at her, not in the mood for her presence]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Did you come back to get your dish?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[softly]</i> May I come in?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, still glaring at her, shrugs and moves aside so she can walk in. Stefan, having heard Lily's arrival, walks into the foyer to investigate]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: What's going on?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: You were right.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon looks at her in shock]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[snarkily]</i> Pardon me? I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't quite hear what you said.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> LILY: <i>[sighs]</i> You were right about Julian. I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner. I've traded one monster for another... But I am <i>not</i> going to let him hurt us anymore.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan and Damon continue to stare at her in surprise, and Lily looks determined to do right by them this time]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> LILY: I have a plan. And this time, we won't get caught.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan and Damon look at each other, still surprised by this turn of events]</i>
