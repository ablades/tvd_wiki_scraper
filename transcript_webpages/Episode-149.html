<p><i>[The scene picks up right where the end of the <a href="/wiki/I_Would_for_You/Transcript" title="I Would for You/Transcript">previous episode</a> left off, with Stefan bound to a chair at Caroline's news station while Rayna and Damon (who is still weak and woozy from the werewolf venom he was shot up with and is slumped over the news anchor's desk) try to convince him to take Rayna's deal]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Sun's coming up, Stefan. Make your choice.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: It's a pretty big deal, you know? Me offering to take this scar from you? But, hey, I've been on the bench for quite a while, and you look pretty tired. So, let me tap in and give you a breather! Hashtag "you're welcome." Are hashtags still a thing? I don't know, it's been three years...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Say yes, Stefan. You can stop running. You'll get your life back.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[panting]</i> All it's gonna take is one itty-bitty transfer spell. Any more suspense, I might pass out, little brother. Of course, I might pass out anyway.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[sighs]</i> Phone's in my pocket. Valerie can do the spell.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hallelujah, he's seen the light. Now, I'm just gonna loosen these love-knots a little bit, just to get his phone.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Rayna aims her gun at him as he does as he said]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Make sure he behaves.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon's hands sizzle as he loosens Stefan's restraints]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You okay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Brother, I'm so full of werewolf toxin, I can't even feel my face. A little vervain's not gonna hurt me now.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon and Stefan share a significant look before they each nod at the other. Just then, Stefan breaks through his ropes before shoving Damon across the room, where he hits Rayna and causes them both to fall in a heap on the floor. Rayna accidentally shoots her gun, which hits one of the windows and shatters. Stefan then takes Rayna's sword and vamp-speeds away with it while Damon takes a piece of broken glass and cuts Rayna on the back with it before grabbing a nearby power cord and wrapping it around her neck, squeezing it tightly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: <i>[gasps]</i> If you kill me, you kill anyone I've marked with my sword. That includes your brother.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Don't worry about Stefan. I'm just giving him a head-start.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon tries to use the cord to put her in a sleeper-hold to knock her out, but Rayna manages to pick up her gun and shoot him with another werewolf-venom-laced bullet, causing causing them both to pass out on the floor]</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: See? Now I'm in St. Petersburg! Red pin, I'm in Malaysia. Red pin... Oh, dear. I've landed in the ocean.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan chuckles as he grabs a bottle of bourbon from the liquor cabinet]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: They do sell liquor elsewhere, you know. It's best to travel light.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Yeah, but... it's my favorite kind. I'm wondering how many more of these I can have, now that I'm on a time limit...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: No time limits here. The night is young, my friend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I'm not talking about tonight. I did the math. Rayna Cruz won't live forever, therefore neither will I. So, tick-tock.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: And you've found mortality doesn't trouble you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: No, actually. Funny thing is, it makes me feel human again, like every minute counts.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Then... let's think of it as an adventure!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Right now?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Damon's gone. You have no one waiting at home anymore. I have no one, either. Why not just follow where the red pins lead?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[chuckles]</i> So, you want to go, uh, pin-hopping all over the world?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: While we search for a way to get rid of your scar. We could trace Rayna's bloodline back to wherever her ancestors come from. Start searching for answers there. But best-case scenario, we save your life. Worst case? We have a <i>long</i> vacation. Everyone you know has made the choice that serves them best. Why not make a choice that serves you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[sighs]</i> Well, I guess there's nothing left to hold me back here. Sure.

</p>
<dl><dd> ALEX: Three years with us, and you <i>still</i> haven't learned to sit quietly. Do you like the change in scenery?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[angrily]</i> Where is she? What did you people do to her? Where is Mary Lou??
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: We need your help.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[scoffs]</i> The only help I'd ever give you is off a cliff!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: Oh, I don't think that's true, because we have something you want-- answers about the research we've been doing with your girlfriend.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora, realizing she has no choice if she wants Mary Louise safe, looks defeated]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: I'll do anything. Just... name your price.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: The price is a name, actually. Lorenzo St. John.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[confused]</i> Enzo? Why do you want him?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: So I can kill him myself.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The scene cuts to a hallway, where Nora, looking slightly less pale and wearing a sweatshirt over the clothes she was wearing earlier, is walking with Alex]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: Not that I'm not grateful for the chance to get some air, but what exactly am I doing?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: I believe Enzo released Rayna Cruz. Why? I have no idea. Why does Enzo do anything lately? But I have learned over time that if I can't trust my family, I certainly can't trust my usual team. And that's where <i>you</i> come in.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alex stops in front of a door and turns to Nora]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALEX: You can be the one to hunt him down.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[incredulously]</i> You trust the girl you've held captive for three <i>bloody</i> years?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALEX: <i>[chuckles]</i> "Trust" may be too strong a word. But after you see the results of our experiments, you'll be highly incentivized to do what I want.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She holds her hand in front of the digital door lock, and as the lock glows green, the door opens to reveal Mary Louise sitting on a bed, looking even more pale and sick than Nora. Nora wastes no time rushing into the room to reunite with her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: Are you all right?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise nods weakly, keeping her arms under the white comforter over her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Just... just feeling cold.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: Who could blame you in this horrid, damp basement? Every day, I dream I'll carry you away from this place, leaving a trail of gutted corpses in our wake.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Despite Mary Louise's obviously dire condition, she manages to laugh weakly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: You seem quite yourself.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora affectionately squeezes Mary Louise's arm, and she winces before reflexively pulling her arm out from under the covers, though it's clear she was trying to hide them from Nora, who gasps in shock at the sight of them. Her forearms and hands are covered in painful-looking, blood-red lesions, and Nora looks horrified and concerned for Mary Louise while also being appalled by what the Armory has been doing to her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: What happened?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[weakly]</i> They gave me pills...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise opens her hand, revealing one of the pills in question inside]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Made from Rayna's blood. It's poisonous to witches.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora turns and glares at Alex, who is standing in the doorway]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALEX: Bring Enzo back to me, <i>alive</i>, and I'll give you everything I have to heal her.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora instantly stands up, but Mary Louise grabs her by the wrist to stop her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[fearfully]</i> No, please don't go!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[pained]</i> I have to. I'm going to save you.
</dd></dl>

</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Hey, Martel. What's up? I got your text. I owe you for calling off the alert on the whole hostage hoax, so whatever you want, man.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Martel, who has remained speechless this entire time, opens the door to the backseat of his car, and Enzo vamp-speeds out and grabs Matt in a choke-hold]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: All he wants is to cooperate with me. I compelled him to summon you here while remaining silent and calm.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Still holding onto Matt's throat, Enzo turns to Martel]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Detective, cuff yourself to the car.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo sighs as he turns back to address Matt, staring at him intensely]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: So, by now, I'm <i>sure</i> Alex has decided that I'm the one who let Rayna escape, which, of course, is untrue.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo starts to squeeze Matt's throat even harder]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: But what I've yet to understand is... why did <i>you</i> release Rayna Cruz?

<p><i>[Stefan is driving down a back road in Texas as he talks to Valerie on his phone while she packs up her belongings at their apartment]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: So, Damon said he could take my scar through a transfer spell. Does that make any sense to you?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie looks uncomfortable, but is able to cover it up well since Stefan can't see her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: He must have been desperate to come up with that idea.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[scoffs]</i> Ironic that he's the one that finally figured it out, considering how far you and I went looking for a solution.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie picks up two white pillar candles and packs them into her bag]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I suppose fate has a sense of humor...

<p><i>[Just then, her phone beeps, and she checks it for a moment before returning to the call]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Taxi's here. I better go.

<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hey, be careful, okay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[smiles]</i> Always, love. I'll get to Dallas as quickly as I can.

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Oh, you stayed to keep me company. How sweet.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Nice try. Once I'm done patching myself up, I'm out of here... Because as much as I'd like to kill you first, my sword is on the move, and so is my target. I have to chase them both. My mystical nature calls.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She winces as she puts in the stitches to close her wound, and Damon groans as he flops onto his back on the floor]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: So weird, how Stefan ran away from your offer...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[rolls his eyes]</i> He's just being a martyr. He probably thinks I can't handle the scar.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He pulls his phone out of his pocket and holds it up]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: As soon as I charge this, I'll call him. Tell him to get his ass back here. We'll do the transfer spell.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: <i>[surprised]</i> That is downright <i>noble</i>. More than I expected from you. Especially considering everything you have to give up.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> What am I gonna give up? I've been in a coffin for the last three years. It's not like I was keeping up with my hobbies.

</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Look at my arm. What do you see?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[shrugs]</i> Someone who should have brought bandaids?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: I'm made up of regular flesh and bone. My body's 100% human. Even if I stay in good health, in sixty to seventy years, I'll toddle off to the big news station in the sky... Which means right around the time Elena wakes up, I'll be dead. So will you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon's eyes widen in horror when he realizes what she's saying]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Because if I die, you'll die. But I'm sure you already figured out that when you take the scar, you'll be giving up your future with Elena. You'll never see her again. A hero move. Nice.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She cuts the fishline she's using to stitch herself up while Damon gapes at her in shock. Now finished, she stands her to feet and sighs]</i>

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: And...?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: And I realized that by the time he wakes up, I will probably be dead. So, uh, no... Never gonna call him again.

<dl><dd> VALERIE: ...And, likewise, he will never call you.

<p><i>[Damon is driving to the airfield when Valerie, who he placed in the passenger seat, finally wakes up from her vervain nap to find that she's been bound]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[mockingly]</i> Good afternoon. This is your captain speaking. We have leveled off at our cruising altitude. Please feel free to move about the cabin, unless you are tied up with vervain rope...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[annoyed]</i> Why did you stop me from doing the spell?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I put a little spin on your plan.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[groans]</i> God, you're an <i>ass</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> You're one to talk! How long did you know you could fix Stefan's problem?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie looks uncomfortable]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Your suggestion was news to me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Not what I asked. How long have you known the answer? For example-- my thinking was, "Hey, the transfer spell worked on Ric's babies. Maybe it'll work on the scar." Three years go by, and that little concept <i>never</i> crossed your mind? If I was a betting man-- which I am-- I would bet that you knew about the spell all along. And rather than sharing it with my brother, you <i>lied</i> to him.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I <i>never</i> lied to him.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: But you didn't tell him the truth either, did you? Because you didn't want to get rid of that scar. Because without his scar to keep him running, he could've gone back to Caroline. How insecure could you <i>possibly</i> be?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: All right, I lied. But I wasn't protecting myself, I was protecting <i>him</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: By risking his life??
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: By keeping you out of it! The Phoenix Scar requires a special kind of transfer. It can only go to a blood relative, and that would've meant waking you and bringing you and all the drama that you come with back into his life-- a life which he was finally thriving in without you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I get it. You think I'm a piece of crap. And by the way, I was. <i>Before</i>. And then I met a girl, and she made me good. And that's why I need Elena in my life. And when I get her back in my life, I <i>will</i> be there for Stefan.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: The only person you ever needed was by your side all along, and you abandoned him. So, I took your place. I took Caroline's place. I've been <i>everything</i> to him.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, Valerie's phone starts to ring]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Sounds more like he was everything to <i>you.</i> I'll take that.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon sees that Stefan is calling and answers the phone]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hold tight, brother. This vintage beast only goes so fast.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: <i>[shouts]</i> He's refusing to participate!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[concerned]</i> Val, you okay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[quickly]</i> She's wonderful. She's great. She's a rock. And yes, I am fully participating.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Yeah, by kidnapping me instead of doing the spell.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I needed you for backup. I didn't have time to argue. Shut up.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[shocked]</i> You're not doing the spell?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Stefan?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: We <i>are</i> still gonna save you. The calvary's coming to you, brother. We're gonna take down Rayna. You're gonna get your freedom, and I'm still gonna get my future.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[appalled]</i> So you're <i>not</i> taking the scar?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Relax! I have a good plan.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[angrily]</i> Answer the question, Damon.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Stefan, listen--
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Say it! I want to hear you say it. You're not taking the scar.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I have a plan!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You always do.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: He should've never trusted you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[scoffs]</i> Oh, don't get me started on "trust."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: All right, can we just stay focused here? How far--
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Suddenly, a gunshot is heard as it hits Stefan in the back, and he gasps in pain and falls to his knees as Valerie and Damon look horrified. Rayna is standing behind him with her sawed-off stake-shooting shotgun in her hands as she walks toward him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[anxiously]</i> Stefan? Stef?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan grunts as he tries to pull the mini-stake out of his back, and Rayna throws her gun aside in favor of pulling out her sword. She grabs Stefan's phone off the ground and gives Damon one last goodbye before she hangs up]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: I'll catch you later.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie glares at Damon furiously]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: We're too late! We're too late because of <i>you</i>!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No. No, we'll be there in ten minutes.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: You're clinging to the coward's way out. This is <i>exactly</i> why Stefan ran.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I thought Stefan ran to save me from Rayna?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: He ran because he knew that when the moment came, you'd let him down and choose yourself. In his heart of hearts, <i>that's</i> what he thinks of you, and he's right. <i>Now</i> is when you prove who you really are.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[groans]</i> Ugh, okay. Screw it, I'm in. I am Damon Salvatore. I'll figure this out. We need to draw Rayna away from Stefan. Do the spell now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: We have to pull over--
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[overwhelmed]</i> We don't have time to pull over! Just give me the scar now!

<dl><dd> NORA: Well, I don't care what she says. We'll find a way-- together.

<dl><dd> RAYNA: I want to finish our conversation.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[gasping]</i> I prefer our phone calls.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: It hurts me to see you like this, Stefan. I mean, it <i>really</i> hurts me. Because of our connection, I can feel what my targets feel. Like when Matt set me free at the Armory. As soon as I touched my sword, I felt what it did to you.

</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> RAYNA: <i>[voiceover] I felt your scar reopen right then. The smart play would have been Valerie. Get your backup girl and go on the run with her again. But that's not what you wanted.</i>

</p><p><i>[Rayna continues her speech to Stefan while he gasps for breath on the ground]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: You almost gave me time to catch you. You just <i>had</i> to have Damon along for the ride again. Those three years he was in the coffin? Guess that was all the enjoyment you could take.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I didn't enjoy being a fugitive.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: <i>[makes a face]</i> Yes, you did. You were happy while your brother was gone. You were happy <i>because</i> he was gone. And now, here we are, thanks to him.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Why do you care about my mistakes?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: It's not <i>me</i> who cares. It's the Phoenix Stone. Its voice is in my head all the time. You have <i>no</i> idea how loud it is. It wants me to liberate you, Stefan. It is still trying to show you-- the only way for you to be free is to let Damon go.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Rayna kicks Stefan in the chest, causing him to fall backward on his bottom]</i>
