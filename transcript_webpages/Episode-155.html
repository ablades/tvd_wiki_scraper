<p>Flashes from the previous episodes can be seen.(Bonnie is meeting with Virginia at the Mental Health Center. Yvette St. John's decrepit body can be seen in the vault)
</p>
<dl><dd> Virginia: Whatever's inside that vault... wants out. And you have to promise me you won't let Alex set it free.
</dd></dl>
<p>(The Vault is seen open. Men are being drug away as Alex and the others attempt to escape.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I promise.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie seals the Armory with Alex and the other trapped inside, standing at the double doors, begging to be let out.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alex St. John: Bonnie, please!
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie just finished the sealing spell out side the Armory.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: No one's getting out.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie is asleep, as the Shaman transfers the status of Huntress to her.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Rayna: When she wakes, she'll be just like me... full of hatred for you and your kind.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Rayna stabs herself, completing the Shaman's spell, transferring the status of Huntress to Bonnie. Bonnie wakes from her self induced 'witchy' coma as the new huntress. Stefan is worried about Carolina after she had entered Bonnie's mind and was staked, forming a subconscious link to the new Huntress.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: You need to get as far away from her as you can.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan drugs Caroline and forces her to leave her friend before she wakes up. After Caroline awakens in a car, Caroline is clearly mad at Stefan. Stefan and Caroline are in a car driving to get far away from the new Huntress (Bonnie).)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Do you love him?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: I don't know. Can you love someone and leave them behind, right when you need each other the most?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan is attempting to make amends with Damon while letting Caroline's words about abandonment sink in.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: (On the phone with Damon) I'm still mad at you. You put me, quite literally, through hell, and I'm not ready to let that go yet. But don't think I'm not noticing all the good you've been doing lately.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon and Matt is seen carefully putting Bonnie into the back of Matt's cruiser whom he tranquilized to prevent her from killing Damon. The last Everlasting can be seen in the glass coffin in the Armory.)
</p>
<dl><dd>Enzo: Bonnie's life is linked to that of the final Everlasting. If we sever the link, it might also sever the curse. Unfortunately for us, the Everlasting resides in the Armory. The evil in the basement escaped from its vault and could be anywhere.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Dead bodies are seen scattered throughout the Armory, littering the floor, as the camera pans to the Vault.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: We're gonna open the place back up.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie wakes up from the tranquilizer and chokes Matt, who is barely able to stop the car before he is pulled into the back of his car. Bonnie frees herself and speeds off in the cruiser, heading off towards Stefan and Caroline's direction.)
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Outside_The_Armory"> Outside The Armory </span></h2>
<p>(Damon is at the Armory carrying large gas barrels to a central location, while on the phone with Stefan. The conversation goes back and forth between the Armory with Damon, on the road with Stefan and Caroline, and Enzo at the Mental Health Center.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: (over phone with Damon and Enzo): You haven't heard from him?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Nope. Which means, to absolutely no one's surprise, Donovan failed and now Bonnie's huntressing in the wild.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: (Focused on driving away from Bonnie) All right, well, where is she now?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: (In the Mental Ward where Virginia is staying) Coming after one of us. Where else? Weren't you meant to be on a plane?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Flights got cancelled because of the storm. Where are you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: (At the Armory) I'm in Solution Land, baby. There's a preserved body at the Armory called "the final Everlasting." All we have to do is destroy that, Bonster is a monster no more.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Caroline is visibly upset about Damon and Enzo's plan to kill the Everlasting.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (In the Car with Stefan) But if you kill the Everlasting, Bonnie dies. And so do we, for that matter.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: I've been told differently.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: By who? Someone that wants you dead?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: A descendent of the people who created Rayna Cruz.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Yeah, the people who hate us.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Well, whether we believe them or not, it's Bonnie's only chance.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon has assembled three large gas tanks at the two large double door in the front of the Armory. He is turning the gas valves, releasing the gas they contain. He picks up a gasoline can, leaving behind a trail to burn.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Look...best case scenario, we destroy it, everything goes back to normal. Worst case scenario... we all die and Stefan lives to tell the tale of our demise to the lovely Elena.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Are you forgetting about the other problem that's in there?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Oh, you mean the ambiguously terrifying monster from the vault? I'm on it. Perhaps once it's less ambiguous, it will be less terrifying.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Guys, it doesn't matter. Bonnie sealed the whole Armory. You can't get in.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Don't tell me what I can't do.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon sets a trial of gasoline on fire that leads up to three large tanks of gas at the Amory's door. A large explosion ensues. Damon looks back to see that the Armory was well protected with Bonnie's sealing spell. The doors have no visible marks of destruction.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: (Damon disappointed) I can't get in. Plan B. Stefan, call your ex. Obviously, not the one next to you. Valerie. She can siphon the seal.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: That's great, but I have absolutely no idea where to find her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: There is a third option. And let me just tell you, it is just adorable. The cutest little Plan Cs you've ever seen.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Caroline is furious that Damon would even suggest involving her kids.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (exasperated) No! Absolutely not.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: All they have to do is walk up to the door and put their tiny little siphon hands on it...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (In a stern voice) No, my kids are staying out of this, Damon.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: It's for Bonnie!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: No, it's for us. So that we don't have to run anymore. And that is not a good enough excuse to involve my children in this mess.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: You know these scars that we have link her to us, huh?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Coincidentally, Bonnie is seeing and hearing bits of the conversation, as Damon is standing outside on the Armory's lawn with smoking pieces of the destroyed gas tanks.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: She can probably hear what we're saying right now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: We'll find Valerie.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Whatever, bro.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Matt.27s_Cruiser_--Bonnie_is_Driving"> Matt's Cruiser --Bonnie is Driving </span></h2>
<p>(Matt and Bonnie are catching up to Caroline and Stefan.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt: So what's it like when you see them?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I get snippets of conversations. Some visuals. But mostly, I can feel them. Their emotions. They're scared. And they should be. The urges are getting stronger. I can feel it taking over. I don't want to hurt them.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie looks distressed as she is losing control and giving in to the Huntress' urges.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt: Then untie me. Let me help you, okay? I can stop you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I know in my heart that I should. Sorry, Matt.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mental_Health_Center_--_Ashville.2C_North_Carolina">Mental Health Center -- Ashville, North Carolina</span></h2>
<p>(Enzo is meeting with Virginia at the Mental Health Center)
</p>
<dl><dd> Enzo: My name's Enzo. Bonnie's friend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Virginia: She didn't listen, did she? After everything I said, she still opened the vault?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: It's complicated.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Virginia: If that thing's allowed to get out in the world, we're...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: That's why I'm here. We need to know exactly what we're dealing with, so we can fight it.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Virginia is scared and concerned with the 'monster' within the Vault.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Virginia: You can't fight it. You can't kill it. It's been alive for thousands of years.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: (Compelling Virgina) Don't be scared, love. Now tell me what it is.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Alaric_and_Caroline.27s_Home_--_Dallas.2C_Texas"> Alaric and Caroline's Home -- Dallas, Texas</span></h2>
<p>(Alaric is cooking cookies. He places a couple on a plate for the girls. The twins are video calling with Caroline while they draw and color.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Josie: Then Lizzie had three cookies, and I only had two.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Lizzie's eyes go wide as she corrects her sister.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Lizzie: Two and a half.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (Still on the run with Stefan driving down the highway.) Wow. This sure is a lot of cookie talk for 8:00 in the morning.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alaric is placing cookies on the plate in front of the twins.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Yeah, well, the girls wanted cookies and Daddy needed something to take his mind off things.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: So you stress baked?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: There's got to be a more masculine way you could say that.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Caroline laughs)
</p>
<dl><dd> Lizzie: I miss you, Mommy.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: I miss you, too, baby.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: All right, wave good-bye, girls.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Lizzie and Josie: (Waving goodbye) Bye.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Caroline waves goodbye)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Be safe. (The phone beeps off)
</dd></dl>
<p>(Caroline is upset that she is having to run and cannot be with her children.)
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stefan.27s_Car"> Stefan's Car </span></h2>
<dl><dd> Caroline: They're three years old. They shouldn't be involved in this world. Not yet.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan looks concerned for Caroline)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Lizzie siphoned me the other day. The girls had their friend's birthday party, and Lizzie took Josie's goodie bag. I took it back from her and then she grabbed my arm. She didn't mean to. I just want them to have as normal a childhood as possible.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan comforts Caroline, reassuring her it is <i>her</i> choice.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: It's your decision. Period.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (Feeling somewhat relieved) Thank you. This doesn't let you off the hook, you know. For the leaving or the kidnapping.
</dd><dd> Stefan: No?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: No.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Hmm. Not even a...a little bit?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Nope. Not even a little bit.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I feel...a thaw.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: There is definitely not a thaw.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Okay.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Caroline's phone rings interrupting their semi-playful conversation, Bonnie is calling)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Bonnie?
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Matt.27s_Police_Vehicle"> Matt's Police Vehicle </span></h2>
<p>(The conversation flips back and forth between Bonnie and Stefan's car.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: (Tensed) I need you to drive faster.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Why? What happened?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I'm gaining on you. Tell Stefan to drive faster and don't stop. (Stefan raves the engine.)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: How'd you catch up to us?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie is using the siren on Matt's cruiser and the police lights are flashing.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: We have a police siren, okay? It's been helpful.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Okay. We won't stop, I promise.
</dd></dl>
<p>(The Dispatch in Matt's car goes off.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Dispatch: All units, we have a six-car pileup on eastbound 60 at Franklin Drive. Injuries reported. Please respond.
</dd></dl>
<p>(They are al visible worried that they are on Highway 60.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Tell me we're not on 60.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: (sighing) We're on 60.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan arrives at the car pileup on 60 and slams to a halt, tires screeching, coming up with a Plan B.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: (Sensing Stefan's fear and that they had stopped) Oh, no.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I got this. (Stefan puts the car in reverse, tires squealing, engine revving. He drives back toward the opposite direction, on coming car horns honking at them.)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Stefan?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie is heading in their direction, straight for them.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Why do I feel you getting closer?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: All you have to do is let us drive by you, Bonnie.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I can't do that.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Yes, you can.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: No, she can't! (Matt is struggling with the bindings on his wrist.)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Come on... Bonnie.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan is weaving in and out of traffic, heading the wrong way down the road. Bonnie in Matt's cruiser can be seen in the distance.)
</p><p>(Bonnie is trying to fight the Huntress' nature within her.
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I'm sorry.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie is heading straight towards Stefan car, planning for a head on collision. Matt breaks free from the rope bindings and pull the stirring wheel, forcing Bonnie off the road, down an embankment into the woods at the last possible second. The car crashes into a tree. Caroline and Stefan are spared, saved by Matt.)
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Outside_The_Armory_2"> Outside The Armory </span></h2>
<p>(Damon is speaking with Enzo, who is leaving the Mental Health Center. Damon is still outside the Armory, coming up with yet another plan to get inside.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: (On the phone with Enzo.) Let me guess, It's an ancient, tentacled evil that will destroy our lives and the world as we know it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: (Not in the mood for Damon's jokes) Don't be ridiculous. No tentacles.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Do I even want to know?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Will it deter you from going in?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Nope.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Then no, you don't. Has anyone heard from Valerie?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Unnecessary.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Somebody has a plan. Care to share?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: It's messy.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: I fear you've forgotten just how messy I can be.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Small runway a few miles east of the Armory. Meet me there. Bring your cowboy boots.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id=".28Stefan.29_Gas_Station"> (Stefan) Gas Station </span></h2>
<p>(Stefan and Caroline are out pumping gas and she is visible worries about Bonnie and Matt who crashed.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (Concerned and afraid for her friends) Do you think they're okay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: We have to assume they are. And that she's still after us.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan finishing filling the car up with gas.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Any word from Damon?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan checks his phone for any messages.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Nothing. Listen...you should get going.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (Somewhat alarmed) You're not coming with me?
</dd></dl>
<p>(He hands her the keys to the car that he was driving.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I haven't heard from Damon, which means he probably has a plan that doesn't involve us. Therefore, it can't be a good one. I should handle it.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Airplane_Runway_--East_of_the_Armory"> Airplane Runway --East of the Armory </span></h2>
<p>(Damon and Enzo are walking down the runway towards a large, personal, red and white plane.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Enzo: (Slightly annoyed) This was the best you could find?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Best, no. Closest, yeah.
</dd></dl>
<p>(A mechanic is working on the plane.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Hey. Where's the pilot? Called him a few hours ago. He said he'd be here.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Maintenance Man: Well, he was, until you called and told him to forget it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Except I didn't do that.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Maintenance Man: Are you Damon Salvatore?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Yes.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Maintenance Man: Well, that's who called.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon is very upset and vamp-speeds towards the mechanic, grabbing him by the neck.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: (Contained anger emerges in his voice) You bring that pilot back before I rip your throat out.
</dd></dl>
<p>(He lets the mechanic go.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Spot of turbulence?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon's phone rings, Stefan is calling.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: More like interference. (Damon answers the call.)
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stefan.27s_Car_2"> Stefan's Car </span></h2>
<p>(Stefan is in a new car, heading towards the Armory. The conversation flips back and forth between the car and the runway.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Salvatore Airlines, may I help you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: You think you're clever?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Wow. Considering the fact that I tracked down you, your pilot and your plan, all in a little bit of brotherly intuition, yes, Damon, as a matter of fact, I do.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Have you forgotten that I'm running from a hunter, Stefan? I'm trying to get out of her way.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Oh, come on. We both know that's not why you're getting on the plane.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: You have no idea what I'm up to.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Really? Because I think you're headed to Dallas to kidnap two innocent children.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon attempts to fool Stefan.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: (Trying to get around the current situation) Or I'm headed to Dallas to speak to their father and talk some sense into him.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Hmm. And if he says no?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: (In a stubborn tone) Well, then, I will kidnap those two innocent children, because that's the right thing to do.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: No. The right thing to do is to let Caroline, their mother, decide what's best for them.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: (Still stubbornness to Stefan's argument) She's wrong, Stefan.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Well, it's her choice and I'm gonna let her make it. See ya.

<p>(Stefan hangs up the phone.)

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Tell me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Bonnie almost got us, but I'm okay.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Look, you guys can't keep doing this. You've got to find another way.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Damon and Enzo can fix her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Well, that's great.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (she sighs) It involves Josie and Lizzie.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: (he takes the phone off of speaker mode and picks it up.) What? What do they need?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (Hesitantly explains) To get into the Armory. Lizzie and Josie could siphon Bonnie's spell. I said no. Instantly. Because I thought it was just about me and Damon and Enzo, and that's fine. You know, I'm willing to run, they're willing to run... (sighs) but then I talked to Bonnie on the phone and... gah, she's scared, Ric. And she's in pain. But they're your kids and I can't make that decision for them.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Well, they're not just my kids, Caroline, they're <i>our</i> kids, and that's a decision we need to make together.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: She's my best friend. I don't know what to do.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Well, look, it's been almost a week since the girls have been able to hug their mother, so... (sighing) if there's something we can do to make sure it's not two weeks, or three, or never...just tell me what it is we need to do.

<dl><dd> Matt: (groaning) Yeah. (Continues groaning) Just stuck. How about you? Are you okay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Of course I am. Because if I were dead, then this would all be over and everyone could go back to their lives. But we're not that lucky.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: They'd be dead too, Bonnie. They're marked. If you die, they die.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: So this is just gonna go on forever.
</dd></dl>

<p>(Damon has his back to Stefan while drinking from his flask. They hold a conversation in the Armory courtyard.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Well, you're awfully quiet. Don't tell me you're still mad about the pilot. Caroline's bringing her kids, and we're gonna get inside, and that's all that matters.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: (Confusion and slight sarcasm in his voice) What happened to you, hmm? You and I had a breakthrough yesterday. You pulled a Damon. You made the right choice, to hell with the consequences. We actually agreed, Stefan. I sent out a press release. And then you spend one night with blonde ambition. You're right back to your old, boring, choice-matters self. What the hell, man?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: (Incredulous) Do you really think that I did the right thing by taking Caroline against her will?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: One hundred percent.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: (Voicing his opinion) You said that's how you know you love someone. And for a second there, I actually, I actually believed you. I thought that my love for Caroline was so strong that I would do anything to protect it. But then I realized, that's not love, Damon. That's fear.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: (Bitter sarcasm) You should put that on a greeting card.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: That night that you put yourself down, it wasn't because you loved Elena. It was because you were afraid if you didn't, you would do something terrible, and you would lose her forever. And that fear, that fear was so powerful that it overrode any love that you felt for me or Bonnie or anybody else.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: It wasn't about you, Stefan.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: (Slightly angered) Oh, it had absolutely everything to do with me. No. I looked you in the eyes, Damon, and I begged you to stay. And you turned your back on me like it was nothing. And I thought about that yesterday, when I "pulled a Damon." And I realized...I never want to be that person. I refuse to be ruled by fear. I refuse to be you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: They're here.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alaric and Caroline holding the twins hands inbetween them arrive at the Armory.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: You guys know why we're here? (The twins shake their heads 'No') Because there's something inside this building that's really important that we need. The only problem is these doors are locked, so we're gonna need your help to open them, okay?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alaric, Caroline and the twins are at the front door of the Armory.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (Loving voice) Want to know something cool? You two are special because you two are the keys. Let's play a game. Everyone put one hand on the door.
</dd></dl>
<p>(They place their hands upon the armory doors)Remember Amy's birthday party? I took away your goodie bag, and what happened?
</p>
<dl><dd> Lizzie: I hurt you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Yes, because I took something from you. Now...how would you feel if someone tried to take me away from you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Lizzie: Mad.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Josie: Sad.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (Slightly, emotionally effected by her loving daughters) Yeah, me, too. And if we don't get inside of here, that might happen. I might never be able to see you or hug you or... tuck you in at night.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Lizzie and Josie's hands are glowing as they are siphoning Bonnie's Seal)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: (Slightly surprised and happy) It's working.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (enthusiastically) Keep going, girls.
</dd></dl>
<p>(The twins are overwhelmed with magic, as they finished siphoning the seal. Alaric and Caroline both embrace their daughters.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Good job.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (Voicing her feelings of pride for her daughters) Good job you two! You did so good.

And over and over again, it's screwed you, and so, this time, I need a different kind of help, okay? I need you... to let me go. Let me succeed or let me fail... but let me do it by myself. I'm sorry I walked out on you that night. You're right, I was scared. And I knew you'd be mad, but I also knew that you'd be okay. I know my choices suck sometimes, and you like to be there to head them off at the pass, but this time... I need you to believe in me. Okay?

Throwing everything, including himself, at that door, trying to get it open.After a week, Alaric managed to crack the security code. We were prepared for almost anything... except what we saw. It was empty.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie rushes into the Vault)
</p>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Enzo?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline (voiceover): Completely cleaned out. I don't know how they got out, but they did.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: (Desperate) Enzo!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline (Concerned voiceover): I'm worried about Bonnie. She lost the two people closest to her, and she can't even do a locator spell to find them. Her magic never came back. She feels hopeless.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Bonnie falls to the Vault floor, in tears.)
</p><p>--Back in Mystic Falls--
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt (seen but providing a voiceover): I reached out to all my contacts, knowing they'd show up sooner or later. I owed 'em that much. Then I left. Because as sad as it is, this isn't my fight. And if I'm ever going to be happy, I have to recognize which ones are.
</dd></dl>
<p>--Salvatore Boarding House--
</p><p>(Bonnie, Caroline and Stefan are doing research on their own computers, papers are spread out across the tables.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan (voiceover): It was three months before we heard the first rumor... a string of missing persons on the West Coast. It was encouraging. But then the numbers kept growing. 20, 50, 60 people missing.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan is writing in his diary.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan (voiceover): It's them. I know it. I don't know what's wrong with them, or what they're doing, or why... but I promise you, we'll get him back. Just know that whatever happens between now and then... it's not his fault.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan sadly closes his diary)
</p><p>-- Unknown Warehouse --
</p><p>(Damon is dragging in another body, seemingly alive but unconscious. Damon walks past a large pool of dripping blood on the floor.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Enzo: There you are.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: (Teasingly) Aw, did you miss me?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Damon hoists up the body on chains, while Enzo presses a button to raise him into the air. When the body is facing Damon, he slits his throat.)
</p>
<dl><dd> Enzo: (Content) Never gets old, does it?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: It sure as hell hasn't yet. (He smiles a wild, devilish grin.)
</dd></dl>
<p>(The camera fades out and countless of hanging bodies can be seen.)
