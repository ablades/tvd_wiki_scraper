<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>[Checking on Bonnie, comforting her]</i> Hey, how you feeling?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I don't know. Just feel different.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Considering you were on death's door, that's probably a good thing.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Okay, here's how I'm feeling: I'm thirsty and starving.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: I'm on it.
</dd></dl>

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I actually think I want a bourbon. Neat.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: There's the girl I love.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo gets up, pours bourbon into a drinking glass. Hands her a glass of bourbon.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Right. What should we drink to then?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: New beginnings.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie raises her glass of drink, smashes the glass on Enzo's head; stunning him before he can react, breaks his neck and kicked his body into the fireplace and looks shifty as Enzo's body is burning in the fire.]</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: <i>[Opens door to his house, looking as he gets in.]</i> What's happening?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Nothing's happening, mate. That's the problem. Bonnie won't wake up.

<p><i>[Enzo is pondering in front of a fireplace, Damon is pouring himself a drink.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Damon: Rayna screwed us. She failed to mention that by giving Bonnie her life, she was actually giving Bonnie her lifestyle. So now when Bonnie wakes up, she's gonna be Rayna 2.0. And does that gift begin with a very long nap? I didn't get a chance to ask as she burst into flames. And before you ask, no, I did not get a chance to interrogate her little shaman friend, because he vanished at the same time.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: <i>[Getting annoyed from Damon's thoughts on what happened with Rayna.]</i> Damon, did the spell work or not?!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: I don't know, Enzo. I have no idea why she's not waking up. I mean, the least she could do to thank us for saving her life is just open her eyes, let us know whether or not she wants to murder us.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: <i>[Giving his thoughts after doing some thinking.]</i> What if she doesn't?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: What? Oh, you know her as well as I do.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Waking up means she'll have to kill us. So what if the reason Bonnie isn't waking up is because she's Bonnie?

<dl><dd> Caroline: I think she's better off in here, don't you think? It's quieter and more peaceful... Did you grab those scented candles?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: <i>[Taking out chains from a bag.]</i> Not exactly.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric walks with the chains towards where Bonnie is.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: No. No, you're not going to do this. <i>[Grabs the chains from him and puts it back in the bag.]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: You heard what Damon said. If she wakes up...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: When she wakes up, we do not know what she's going to be or how she's going to feel. And if we chain her up, we've made that decision for her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Okay, fine. No chains. But then I'm not leaving.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Ric. The flight's in an hour, it's the last flight out tonight and Lizzie and Josie have been stuck with a sitter for two days now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: I know, but if this goes the wrong way, I'm the one person Bonnie's not gonna want to kill on sight, okay? I should be here with you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: While our three year old children are in a different time zone?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Okay, then you get on the plane. Let me stay here and help. That's the safest, most logical plan anyway.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: I am the single best person for Bonnie to see when she wakes up... and you are the single best person for our girls to see when they wake up. Take the flight. I'll be home as soon as I can. I promise.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: I'm gonna hold you to that promise.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: We'll get through this.

</p>
<dl><dd> Deputy: Sir? <i>[Knocks on door and holds it open, which has caught Matt's attention.]</i> I know you said you didn't want to be disturbed. Is there a break in Penny's case?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: Yeah, it turns out it was an accident. <i>[Looks at her photo for the last time, closes her file.]</i> You need something, Deputy?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Deputy: Yeah, you wanted to be notified if there was any activity over at the Salvatore house. Seem to be some squatters tonight. Do you want me to go over there and...?

<dl><dd> Stefan: <i>[Sitting at the bar area having a drink, his phone rings and sighs as he sees who is calling him.]</i> What do you want, Damon?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: <i>[Calling Stefan from home.]</i> Do you never check your voicemail? I left you about nine messages.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Yeah, sorry. I've been a little busy telling Matt Donovan he's the reason his <a href="/wiki/Penny_Ares" title="Penny Ares">fiancée</a>'s dead.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Ooh. Do I want to know how that went?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Probably not. You also probably don't want to know how screwed you are with Bonnie either. <i>[Takes a sip of his drink.]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number... Because I dialed H for "hero," clock's ticking, brother. You need to get your head in the game.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: My head is in the game, Damon. My life was blown apart when I was marked by Rayna's <a href="/wiki/The_Phoenix_Sword" title="The Phoenix Sword">sword</a>, you remember that? I had to leave everything I loved behind and run for years. So as much as I want Bonnie to wake up, I'm not exactly looking forward to doing that again.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: All right, all right, I get it. You don't have any ideas, I don't either. This conversation just got really depressing.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Well, I never said I didn't have an idea.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[In the next scene, Stefan is at the Salvatore boarding house, talking to Enzo.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Rayna used to say that she had to kill me, but she didn't want to. She could sense my humanity through some sort of psychic link. So if Bonnie's fighting the same war in her head, we need to give her some ammunition.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: What, so one of us needs to delve into her subconscious, and... do what exactly?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Convince her hunter-brain that not all vampires are selfish vicious monsters. It's exactly why I'm the worst person for the job.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: She's my girl. I'll do it.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline is seen walking into the living room where hey are talking.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: No, it should be me. I was her best friend before I was a vampire. I can show her the difference between the two.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: She's right.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: I just wanted to see if you needed anything.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: You want to be helpful? Then do your thing and run away so I can focus on my friend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Okay, I can take a hint. [Backs out as he thought Caroline told him to get out.]

</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Now for our favorite subject. Anyone? Anyone?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie is in the classroom on a seat in the front row.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Vampires, real or myth? Bonnie?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Myth.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Wrong. Vampires are as common today as mosquitoes. <i>[Shows a powerpoint for his lecture on the subject.]</i> They can walk in the daylight, kill from the shadows. Hell, some of your best friends might be vampires... So what do we do when we meet a vampire? Anyone?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Sorority Girl: <i>[Appears as a vampire, noticeable with blood on her lips running down to her chest.]</i> Invite them to the party.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Very funny. <i>[Students as vampires are shown feeding on their classmates.]</i> Anyone else? How about you, Bonnie? What would you do, huh? Would you sit there, or would you run? <i>[Starts to grip her neck with strength hard.]</i> Or would you fight back? Show me how to kill a vampire, Bonnie. <i>[His face starts to change, showing he's a vampire like the other students in class.]</i>

<dl><dd> Bonnie: This isn't real! <i>[Gets out of his grip and starts to run out of the classroom.]</i>

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: <i>[Appears in her room.]</i> My God. This is what you've been going through?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Get away from me. You're not real.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Well, you're half right, I'm in your head. Your body is safe in Damon's bedroom. This isn't real. And you just need to stay focused on me, Bonnie, your friend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Caroline. <i>[Gets up and hugs her.]</i> Something's messing with my head. All my memories are being twisted into these freakish nightmares.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: It's your brain rewiring itself to hate vampires, to become the hunter. You have to resist.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I'm trying. I don't want to hurt you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: You just have to concentrate on who I am, you know, not what I am. I have kids now, Bonnie, and a family. You should see the girls, they are just getting so big. You have to fight the voices in your head. Open your eyes and just come and have dinner with us. We miss you so much.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: <i>[The huntress curse is starting to affect her brain.]</i> Do your kids know that you're a vampire?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Uh, no, we haven't had that talk with them yet. Kind of waiting for the birds and the bees first.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: <i>[Talking creepily as it starting to take over her mind.]</i> And when you tuck them in at night, and you brush the hair off their pretty necks, admire it a little?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Bonnie, that's gross. This is your lizard brain talking. Fight it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: I can't help it. All I see is you losing control. Hurting those little girls.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: No, that's not me. You know that's not me.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Why? You don't understand how she marked me any more than I do.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Caroline, when you were in Bonnie's head, she must have created some sort of psychic link... The scar is just a manifestation of that connection. You need to get as far away from her as you can. Starting now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: No, that is not an option. Enzo's gonna figure it out. He's gonna get through to her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Caroline, I carried that scar with me for three years. I've lived through this before.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: So all of a sudden the past three years have just been a living hell for you? I saw the postmarks on your letters, Stefan. Paris, Marrakech, Bora Bora. I'm shocked you even had time to write between escaping certain death and sipping mai tais. Meanwhile, I was so desperate, I called Klaus for help, who's nowhere to be found, by the way.
</dd></dl>

</dd></dl>

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: Those rules are the last shred of what my fiancée and I built together.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Well, no disrespect to your dead girl, but my still alive girl is hanging on by a thread, and I'm about to use my vampire powers to try to find a loophole in her subconscious, knowing full well that if I fail, I'll be forever marked for death at her hands.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: She wouldn't be in this situation if it weren't for you and Damon... It's an endless cycle. Penny knew that. She knew that we needed to take a stand.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Yeah, how'd that work out for her? <i>[Gets up and continues to talk.]</i> If you want to follow in her footsteps, be my guest.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Meaning we could have gone anywhere? "Anywhere" means Paris, by the way. So why are we walking around in my old high school? I might ask you the same question. I guess I'm trying to find something to hold onto... A time before vampires were a part of my life. Take those stoners, Chad Carpenter used to annoy me after practice every day, but he was a jerk... not a vampire. It's like the spell is overriding who I was. Who I am.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Bonnie: Yeah, I'm still wearing my cheerleading uniform.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: How could I forget? You're trying to remember your life without vampires. Remember us instead. When we wrote music together you not only tolerated a vampire, you fell in love with one. <i>[Offers her an acoustic guitar he picked up in the classroom.]</i> Play that song and you will have something to hold onto.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Well, you don't have a choice. If you don't take Rayna's life...
</dd></dl>

<p>Enzo: I'm sorry, Bonnie, but the one thing I can't do is leave you.

<p>Caroline: "We"? There's no such thing as "we," Stefan... There hasn't been for a very long time.
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Fine. You want to do this alone, that's your choice.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Oh, how ironic, considering that the only reason I'm even here is that you decided to go all caveman and kidnapped me against my will. This is not you. You usually respect people's choices.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Yeah, until it comes to life and death, and then it's not up for discussion. There's always a choice.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: You gave Elena that choice.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: ...And then I lost her. Elena asked me to rescue her friend from the bottom of a river instead of her, and she died because I respected her damn choice.
</dd></dl>
<p>Caroline: Well, maybe one day you'll wake up and realize that I deserve the same respect that she did, but I stopped waiting for that day a long time ago. Whatever I decide to do about Bonnie is a decision that I'm going to make by myself or with my family, but not you.
</p>

</p>
<dl><dd>Bonnie: Screw you, Damon.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Damon: [Continues on to goad her.] Oh you screwed me, all right. Got your life all intertwined with Elena's, dooming me, and let's be honest, all of our friends to a lifetime without the one person we miss the most, which, to be perfectly clear, ain't you. That's why we're on this porch, because it's the first place Elena and I ever kissed. Over there by that bench? The first time she ever had the courage to tell me she loved me, and merely one foot to my right, is where I watched her take the cure so that she could have the life that she dreamed of before you screwed it up, but the very spot you're standing, is the happiest place of all. You know why? Because that's the spot where you're gonna decide to give me my Elena back. So, why don't you close those pretty little eyes and give up the ghost for me?

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Stefan: Look, when I went to go find you in Dallas, here's what I saw... I saw you and Ric and the kids, and you were happy. You know what I didn't see? Me.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Caroline: And three hours ago.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Stefan: Just don't pretend that you wouldn't act any differently. You're doing the same thing with Bonnie right now. You can't accept a world where Bonnie dies. Even though that's a choice that she's trying to make for herself, and you know why? Because you love her too much and there's nothing wrong with that, and I love you, and the thought of you getting hurt... it's not an option that I'm willing to entertain.

<dl><dd> Enzo: Well, as much as it pains me to say it, Matt was man of the match tonight. He found a lead on the shaman who helped Rayna turn Bonnie. Turns out that shaman was quite willing to talk... once he had a good look at his own entrails. [Takes a sip of his drink.]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Tell me you have a way to help her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Maybe, maybe not. <i>[View of The Armory, inside scatters of dead bodies are shown, the last Everlasting is shown.]</i> Bonnie's life is linked to that of the final Everlasting. Sever the link, it might also sever the curse. Unfortunately for us, the Everlasting resides in the Armory.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Yeah, in a coffin, in a forever nap. Piece of cake. <i>[Gulps the rest of his drink.]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Uh, you're forgetting why Bonnie the Good Witch sealed the whole building shut. The evil in the basement escaped from its vault and now it could be anywhere in that bloody maze.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Well, evil be damned. We're gonna open the place back up.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Continuation of showing outside of the vault where an Armory agent is seen alive, banging his head repeatedly against a wall while others are dead.]</i>
