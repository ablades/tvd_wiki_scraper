<p><i>[Damon is laying flat on his back on Route 9, just like he used to do in earlier seasons. After a moment, a man in an SUV honks his horn loudly, and Damon manages to sit up just as the vehicle screeches to a halt only inches away from him. The man gets out of his car and rushes over to Damon to check on him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> COOPER: Whoa, you okay, man?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, looking extremely depressed, holds up his hand]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Mind giving me a hand?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Cooper takes his hand and helps him to his feet, looking at Damon with concern]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> COOPER: What are you doing out here?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sighs]</i> I don't know. I thought it would make me feel better.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Cooper is obviously confused and slightly uneasy about Damon's behavior]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> COOPER: Okay. Should I call someone, or...?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: What's your name?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> COOPER: It's Cooper.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[nods]</i> Cooper... You ever done something so <i>unspeakably</i> horrific you couldn't even look in the mirror? Like, it <i>literally'</i> makes you ill to see your reflection?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon stares Cooper in the eyes and compels him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: And be honest, now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> COOPER: <i>[hesitates]</i> I ran over my girlfriend's cat a couple months ago and didn't tell her. Even though it was an accident, I threw the body in a supermarket dumpster.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon doesn't seem at all impressed by this story and replies in an emotionless voice]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I killed the love of my life. Burned her alive while she was asleep. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Cooper's eyes widen in alarm in horror]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I also beat one of her best friends 'til he was unconscious and left him for dead, if we're keeping score...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Cooper, very scared now, laughs nervously and starts to head back toward his car]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> COOPER: I think I'm just gonna go...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon stops him and stares him in the eyes to compel him again]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Actually, I can use a ride.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon smirks at him]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[The scene cuts to inside the SUV, where Cooper is driving Damon back into town while he continues to talk]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I thought Elena had changed me. I thought she made me a better man, but... I was wrong. I was <i>so</i> wrong. It was always gonna end up this way. With me destroying her. That's what my whole tour-of-duty in the Phoenix Stone has taught me-- is that I'm permanently damaged goods.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon looks over at Cooper, who has been listening silently while he drives down the road]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You ever feel that way, Cooper? 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> COOPER: Hmm? Not really.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon seems shocked at this answer, and just rolls his eyes before he responds]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Well, you're lucky, Coop. I'm gonna kill you now.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Cooper looks at him in alarm]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> COOPER: Excuse me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[shrugs]</i> Oh, it's nothing personal. I'm hungry, you're food... Think of it as a stop at a drive-thru window. You know? You'll be afraid, I won't care...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon thinks about this for a moment before he continues]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Honestly, I can't imagine caring about anyone ever again. Not a single, solitary soul...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Cooper looks terrified as Damon smirks at him before vamping-out and lunging at him. Cooper screams as Damon bites into his neck. The camera cuts to outside the car, which has just screeched to a stop in the middle of the road]</i>

<p><i>[It's the next day, and Caroline is laying in bed, writing in her journal to Elena while she narrates in voiceover]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[voiceover]</i> Dear Elena. I realized I haven't written in a while. I'm sorry. Apparently, pregnancy eats at your brain. Anyway, we all miss you, and Stefan's finally bouncing back from that Phoenix Stone hell. But, he's worried about Damon... a lot more than usual.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Stefan walks through the door with a paper bag in his hands, and Caroline stops writing and sets down her journal so she can greet him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hey, sorry, I was trying to track down my brother.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline smiles happily at him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Curly fries or waffle? I brought both.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[gleefully]</i> All of them. <i>Everything</i>. Gimme, gimme, gimme!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan hands her the bag, and she reaches into it, pulling out a smaller bag of waffle fries that she immediately starts eating. She moans in pleasure as she enjoys her snack]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Mmm, oh, my God! I love you!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan gives her a knowing smile]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Are you talking to me, or are you talking to the fries?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline gives him a mischievous smile in return]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Do you want me to lie to you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[amused]</i> Hmmm.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline leans forward to kiss him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Hi. I love you, too.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When they pull away, Caroline's face becomes concerned]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Did you find him?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[sighs]</i> No. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Okay. Let me just chow down on this cheeseburger, and then I will help you track him down. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline is about to finish eating her food when she suddenly yelps in surprise and grabs her belly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Oh!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks at her with concern as Caroline continues to rub her side with her hand]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Are they kicking again?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Mmhmm. Yeah, just... Ow!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline grabs her side harder and tries to laugh it off]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Yeah, that wasn't very nice. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The babies seem to kick harder, and Caroline yelps again]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Ahh!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks even more worried and moves toward her on the bed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hey, you okay?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline starts to look a little woozy and dazed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Mmhmm. I think I should just, um... I'm gonna stand up.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline starts to stand to her feet as Stefan watches her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Okay...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: For a second.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline gets up and takes some deep breaths as she holds her side, but after a moment, her knees buckle, and she faints, falling forward onto the bed. Stefan rushes over to her and tries to gently wake her up]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hey, hey, Caroline. Hey, Caroline! 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[When Caroline doesn't wake up, he starts to panic]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Caroline!

<p><i>[Matt is still locked up in his holding cell, where he's standing at the door and watching as Officer Penny Ares starts to go through the contents of his duffle bag full of anti-vampire weapons. She looks extremely confused and unnerved by what she finds]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PENNY: So, crossbow... stake gun... wooden ammo... grenades filled with, uh...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[mockingly]</i> Vervain. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Penny looks at him skeptically]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PENNY: Vervain. Right. And you confiscated this stuff from a group of zombie apocalypse survivalists?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: <i>[curtly]</i> That's what I said. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Penny still doesn't seem to believe his story, but she doesn't question it further]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PENNY: Uh-huh. I heard Mystic Falls has become a nutball magnet for all sorts of supernatural thrill-seekers.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MATT: People have a <i>lot</i> of spare time on their hands. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt looks as though he's dying to get out of there, and sighs deeply]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Anything else, Officer Ares?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Penny puts everything back into his bag before she turns back to him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PENNY: No. You're free to go. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She lets him out of the cell and starts to hand him all of his belongings that were taken the previous night]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PENNY: He's your wallet, keys, and phone. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Penny smirks at him in amusement as he looks through his duffle bag]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> PENNY: PS, your MatchASingle.com notifications are blowing up. Lucky you. Mine's crickets. You can call me Penny, by the way. And, I didn't officially book you last night, so... You know, you're welcome.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt seems surprised by this kindness, and he smiles at her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Thanks.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> PENNY: <i>[cheerfully]</i> Hey, chin up. Turns out, they aren't letting your town burn to the ground after all.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt looks extremely concerned by this news and frowns]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: What do you mean?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> PENNY: My friend Doug got a call from the Mystic Falls city planning office this morning. They said he should come reclaim his house today. Something about the fire-risk zone being reevaluated?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Matt becomes even more worried by this news and gulps nervously]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MATT: Do you know what street Doug lives on?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="MYSTIC_GRILL"> MYSTIC GRILL </span></h2>
<p><i>[Julian and his huge band of vampires are gathered in the Grill, where Julian is aiming a pistol at a man who is standing with his back against the far wall and an apple perched on the top of his head. After a moment, Julian covers his eyes with his hand]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Just to make things interesting!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He shoots and hits the apple, leaving the vampire unharmed. He sighs in relief, and Julian crows triumphantly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Bulls-eye! And for your courage, my bold friend, how would you like to make your new home at 224 Harmony Lane? 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He gestures toward an elderly couple sitting quietly at a table behind him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Mr. and Mrs. Leonard, here, have been called back to town so that they might invite you in.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian looks around the room at his friends]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Who's next?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, a familiar female voice calls out to him from the back of the bar]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I'll give it a go.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian turns and looks both furious and horrified to see Valerie standing before him calmly. She hums under her breath as she takes in the scene and walks toward him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Hmmm. Isn't this cozy? How nice it must feel to be surrounded by degenerate yes-men. How <i>safe</i> it must seem.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian hesitates for a moment before he speaks, trying his best to maintain his composure in front of his men]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Valerie, I'm struggling to comprehend you showing your face within two hundred miles of me.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie pulls out a postcard with a red X written on it and holds it out so Julian can see it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I really only wanted to give you something that was delivered to me by mistake. It's a shame someone won't be letting you feel safe for long.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian's eyes widen in horror when he realizes what Valerie has received]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ALARIC.27S_OFFICE"> ALARIC'S OFFICE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Bonnie and Nora are in Alaric's office at Whitmore, where they're kneeling on the floor, each holding one end of the Phoenix Sword. They're surrounded by lit candles, and below the sword is a map of the United States for their locator spell, upon which they've placed the postcard Nora received from the Huntress]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE &amp; NORA: <i>[chants] Phesmatos invenira venatrixos isto gladulla onyx. Phesmatos invenira venatrixos isto gladulla onyx.</i>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[They look down and find that the black sand on the map has made a line from Virginia to Cincinnati, Ohio. Bonnie looks at Nora with a skeptical look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Ohio? Are you sure this isn't a prank or something?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[nervously]</i> It's not a prank. A ruthless killing machine is on her way to hunt us all down. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: But why announce herself with a cryptic postcard? Isn't the element of surprise a basic principle of good vampire hunting?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Just then, Mary Louise appears in the doorway, looking worried]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Not for Rayna Cruz. Rayna has a taste for taunting her victims. Like a cat nibbling the legs off a spider.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora, who is clearly shocked to see her ex, stands to her feet, and after a moment, Bonnie joins her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: What are you doing here?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise sees the postcard on the floor and looks even more concerned]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: You got one, too.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>[sarcastically]</i> And what about Julian?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[sighs]</i> No. But I said we'd take care of the problem. For <i>all</i> our sakes.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Your vampire huntress is currently residing somewhere in Cincinnati.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise ignores Bonnie and continues to stare at Nora]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: Let's get going, Nora. The sooner she's dead, the better.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise turns to leave, but Nora stays where she is, and Bonnie scoffs loudly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Do you think I just did that locator spell for a tune-up? I'm going with you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Mary Louise sneers at her patronizingly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: We're good, thanks.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Uh, I wasn't asking. The last thing I need is a so-called ruthless killing machine going after any of my friends. I need to protect them, and it's not like I can trust either one of you to take her down.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> MARY LOUISE: <i>[irritably]</i> And what makes you think we trust you?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Nora glares at Mary Louise]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> NORA: <i>I</i> trust her. She actually cares about the well-being of others. Unlike you, who only cares about pleasing Julian.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie looks pleased by Nora's support and gives Mary Louise, who looks jealous and hurt, a smug look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I call shotgun!

<p><i>[Julian is at the bar in the Grill, where he has just used a candle to burn the postcard Valerie gave him. He still looks terrified (though still furious at Valerie's appearance), which makes Valerie smirk in satisfaction]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: When did you get this?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: There it is. <i>That's</i> the look I've been yearning to see. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie's voice takes on a mocking tone]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Why, Julian, dare I say you seem <i>afraid</i>? What a shame. To think, you just made yourself a home here, and now you have to run.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[This comment is the last straw for Julian, who turns to one of his vampires behind him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Kyle, if you kill this <i>shrew</i> right now, I'll throw in the Lincoln family Buick.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie looks nervous as Kyle approaches her to kill her, but before he can, Damon appears and decapitates him by throwing a menu at his neck at vampire speed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[smirks]</i> Well, I feel happier!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The sight of Damon coupled with the death of another one of his minions causes Julian to lose his temper completely. He grabs Damon by the lapels and vamp-speeds him against the bar, where he pins him down with his arm]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: What did I say would happen if you ever harmed one of my men again? Hmm?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon just smiles under Julian's grip]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hmm, I think...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon feigns as though he's thinking before he snaps his fingers for emphasis]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: It was something about you gutting me and feeding my entrails to Stefan.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[frowns]</i> Are you sure? She collapsed. That's not normal.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DOCTOR: <i>[shrugs]</i> Well, it's not abnormal, either. Her blood vessels have dilated, which can lower blood pressure.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan doesn't seem convinced, but he nods in agreement anyway. The doctor hesitates before she continues]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DOCTOR: You know, it's best to keep the father in the loop in situations like this. Would you like for me to contact her boyfriend?

<dl><dd> STEFAN: Um, yeah, no-- he's in, the father's in Dallas for a job interview. I'll... I'll call him.
</dd></dl>

<p><i>[He gets ready to plunge his hand into Damon's chest and rip out his heart, but Damon just chuckles sarcastically]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: "Last words?" Hmm. Whoa, that's a lot of pressure. I guess if I had to, I would phrase it as a question-- What's the deal with the "X marks the spot" postcard, hmm? Who are you running from, Big J?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Julian is clearly not pleased, but he maintains his calm demeanor]</i>

<dl><dd> RAYNA: I was careless. The drive to kill... the drive instilled upon me by the shamans... it got a little scrambled in my old age. I staked a checkout girl at the supermarket. My mistake.

<dl><dd> JULIAN: I never had a brother. No siblings at all, actually. Seems I dodged a bullet there.

Unfortunately, Julian easily breaks out and begins viciously punching Damon in the face over and over again for a few long moments before he finally stops. Damon, dazed from all of the blows to his head, struggles to lift his head high enough to look around the crowd to see if Stefan is there. Julian notices what he's doing and laughs]</i>

<dl><dd> JULIAN: You're not really looking for your brother, are you? I mean, even if Stefan did come back, what do you think he would do when he found out what you did to Elena?

<p><i>[Julian pins Damon down by the neck before putting his hand over his chest, preparing to rip his heart out. The crowd begins to cheer enthusiastically as Julian starts to plunge his hand into Damon's chest, but before he can fully break the skin, he's suddenly overwhelmed by a pain infliction spell that causes him to yell in pain and grab his head in his hands. Just then, Stefan appears on the ring, having been cloaked by Valerie to allow him to get there, and he punches Julian in the face, knocking him backwards onto his back. Julian is still incapacitated by the pain infliction spell, allowing Stefan to look at Damon with an incredulous and horrified look. The others in the crowd look worried, but don't intervene out of fear for what will happen to them, just as Valerie appears in front of him]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Listen to me. If you let Julian rip your heart out, I will kill him and then every single person here will instantly rip my head off. But you don't care, do you? Your life doesn't matter and neither does mine, does it?
