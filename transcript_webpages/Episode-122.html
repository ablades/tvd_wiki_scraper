<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="MYSTIC_GRILL">MYSTIC GRILL</span></h2>
<p>(Elena wakes up, Kai talking in the background)
</p>
<dl><dd> Kai: See, we never went out to dinner when I was a kid, so, I always had this fascination with chefs and fine dining. Dad actually let me cook... Taught me to measure by eye. Seasonings to taste, all that stuff, but it's different now in the restaurant world. Everything's on time. It's like, the fries go in, you push a button, it dings and you take 'em out. Literally no guess work.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> (Elena's hands are tied with rope soaked in vervain)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Why am I here?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: Uh, well I spent eighteen years in abandoned restaurants and now I'm showing off the fruits of my labor.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Kai starts eating eggs)
</p>
<dl><dd> Elena: I don't mean the Mystic Grill
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: Oh, you mean like, here here, in Mystic Falls. (laughs) Sorry, I'm nervous. You're like, really pretty.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Why am I here, Kai?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: Well, I took the spell that was keeping supernaturals out of Mystic Falls and I, I like absorbed it...Like ate it, I guess. (Takes another bite) It's cool, huh? First I eat magic, and then eventually, I lose it. But a huge spell like that? I mean, come on. Magic's oozing out of me, it's all over the place. You know, I didn't quite realize I was out of control until I met the manager of the Grill a few hours ago. And he was all like, (mocking voice) "Hey, you can't come in here; we're closed. And you have an unconscious girl over your shoulder." (Elena laughs sarcastically, unamused) And then I was like, "Don't judge me." And then I gave him a heart-attack--tried to, but all I did was make him vomit uncontrollably, which was like, ugh, let's stop that. (Elena stares at him, disgusted) So then I tried again and I think I broke his spine? I mean, I'm not, I'm not really sure, because the <i>third</i> time I tried the spell, he kinda exploded in blood. Whoops. (Takes a drink of coffee)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: What the hell is wrong with you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: I just told you, I have too much magic. (Elena shakes her head) You know, it wasn't until after my test run with the manager that I realized, if I start to merge with Jo and my gushing fountains of magic turn her into that guy, then I'm not gonna have a twin for the merge. So, Elena, that is why you are here. (takes another bite) Because I need to get my magic under control. (Elena glares at Kai) By practicing with you. Or rather, by practicing <i>on </i>you. (Elena looks horrified) Oh, PS: Silver lining, after the manager finally stopped thrashing around, I finally managed a cloaking spell. Thank you. (takes a drink of orange juice; Elena is still glaring) It's easy to do and...undo. <i>Phasmatos oculix.</i> (Dead manager appears on table in front of Elena)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: (gasps and scoots back in her chair, horrified)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: Table for three (laughs) You had no idea.

<p>(Birds chirping; close up of a sleeping Stefan; bottles clanking; thudding; music playing; another thud)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: (gets up, goes downstairs and into the kitchen; Jeremy is standing there, shirtless, a towel around his waist) Oh. Because that's the first thing I wanna see in the morning.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Jeremy: Sorry, I forgot you lived here. (leaves kitchen)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Yeah. Hey, any chance you could help me out with some speakers at Caroline's--(Jeremy's gone) house? (Stefan checks the coffee pot; it's almost empty) Thanks for the coffee. 
</dd></dl>
<p>(Clattering; Stefan goes to check it out)
</p>
<dl><dd> Liv: Ow!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Jo: Sorry! Are you okay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liv: (Comes out into the hallway, her clothes smoking) Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It's just clothes and skin. (See Stefan) Hey, where can I get a tee shirt?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Damon's room. Upstairs, end of the hall. (walks into living room to find Jo and a mess) What are you doing in my house?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Jo: Fire spell. Sort of. It turns out, getting back in touch with your magic isn't anything like riding a bike. (laughs)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Oh.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Jo: I am sorry about that vase, though. Was that expensive?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Well, I don't know. But the Smithsonian would. You should call them.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Alaric comes in holding a large paper bag)
</p>
<dl><dd> Jo: (stands and goes over to Alaric) Oh, thank God. Breakfast. Please tell me that you brought mimosas.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Do you actually think I'd watch this sober?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: And, what exactly are we watching?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Jo: Today, we make smores. In a month, I win the merge and become leader of my coven, guaranteeing it's survival. Liv has me on a 30-day regimen between now and the next celestial event.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: And this regimen has to happen in my living room...why?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Alaric: Damon feels guilty.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: (sarcastically) Well, that's new. And where the hell is he?
</dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WHITEMORE_HOSPITAL">WHITEMORE HOSPITAL</span></h2>
<p>(Close up of Damon snoring)
</p>
<dl><dd> Liz: I paid extra for this room to be a single.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: (stretching) Well, you clearly underestimate the number of women who'd die to spend a night with me. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: Well, I'm not dead yet. (laughs) Any word from Elena?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: (lounging back in his chair) Oh, I got words. Plural. I got, "Something came up at the dorm, had to bail, can we raincheck?" and an emoticon of a cold shower.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: Ouch. Have you at least managed to patch things up with Ric?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Well, baby steps. Step one: allow him to turn my house into Hogwarts. Step two: call in a favor from the Sheriff. Ask her to put out an APB on a super-charged serial killer named Kai Parker.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: (checking her phone) Yeah, I already had my guys on the lookout. No one matching Kai's description popped up overnight.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: What the hell is he doing?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (enters the room) Bad news is: the employee kitchen didn't have a juicer. Good news is: they do now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: What is this?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: It's a kale smoothie. It's good for DNA cell repair (Liz looks to Damon, who shrugs) and for slowing cancer. Oh, are you warm enough?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: I'm fine.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Let me just get you another blanket. (gets blanket out of drawer)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: So you can literally smother her?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (covering Liz up) I'm just trying to help here, since apparently, modern medicine takes forever. I don't understand why we can't skip all the guess-work and go straight to something that works. Like vampire blood.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: We are not having this conversation again, sweetheart.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Okay, then what do you want to talk about? How the doctors can't operate, how chemo won't work, how radiation won't shrink the tumor? Damon, feel free to jump in with your support here at any time.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Well, I think that would require you having my support, Caroline.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: You don't think that our blood will work?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: For 170-odd years, I've never known an instance where our blood cured cancer. But hey, sheriff, if you want to be a guinea pig in an experimental study involving weird, unpredictable magic...Far be it from me to stop you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: Look, sweetheart. For now, I would like to put my faith in science. Which means going home on doctor's orders, having a nice, quiet day and waiting for more MRI results. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: (getting up from his chair) See? Ahh, mommy knows best. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to make sure those witches aren't destroying my house. Feel better. (winks at Liz)
</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> Liv: (rummaging through Damon's drawers; talking to Tyler on the phone) Damon may be a vile creature, but he has the best clothes.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Tyler: (walking through Whitmore) Should I be wondering why you're in Damon Salvatore's bedroom?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liv: Jo scorched my shirt.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Tyler: So you're shirtless in Damon's bedroom.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liv: (laughing) You must be feeling such mixed emotions right now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Tyler: How's the training going?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liv: Jo's terrible. If she went up against Kai today, she'd lose in like, nine seconds. Luke totally called that one.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Tyler: Yeah, but you've got time to whip her into shape. Has Luke been giving you crap?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liv: He's been texting and I've been ignoring.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Tyler: If he finds out you're training Jo--
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liv: He won't. Chill, okay? (hangs up and closes the drawer, taking one of Damon's shirts)

<p>(Caroline enters her living room, holding a flower)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: You kept my orchid alive. That's amazing.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: I wanted everything to be just the same when you finally came home.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan enters the house)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Hey.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: What is this?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Uhm, Stefan volunteered to move your entertainment center in here, so now you can watch TV from your favorite chair.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Yeah, I hooked up the surround sound to your DVD player and I left a universal remote on the table, right there.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: Well, thanks. Guess it never occured to anybody to just...move my chair, but... (Stefan is watching Liz worriedly; Liz smirks) What's the matter? Never seen anyone with Stage 4 cancer before?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Actually, no, I haven't. One of the few perks of starting over ever few decades, real life never really catches up to you.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Caroline comes back downstairs holding a <i>Friends</i> boxset; she hands it to Liz)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: So if you start the <i>Friends</i> boxset now, I'll be back in time for Monica and Chandler's wedding. Stefan, you know how to laugh, right?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Opinions vary. Wait, why? Are you leaving?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Every minute counts, so I'm going to go get a second opinion from one of the world's leading experts in Grade 4 Glioblastoma. (Liz gives Caroline a look) I couldn't sleep; I Googled.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: And where is the internet sending you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Duke.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Duke? You know what, maybe I'll give you a ride. I was thinking of heading that way to check on a friend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: A friend?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Mmmhm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Stefan, I know all of your friends. Elena. Me. (pretends to think) And then that's it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: I think it would be better if you had some company on the road. (turns to Stefan) Thank you, Stefan. (Stefan nods and heads for the door)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (hugs Liz) I will call you every hour on the hour.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: I will set my watch by it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: I love you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: I love you, too. Bye. (Caroline and Stefan leave; Liz sighs and sits in her chair tiredly)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="MYSTIC_FALLS_HIGH_SCHOOL">MYSTIC FALLS HIGH SCHOOL</span></h2>
<p>(Elena wakes up, hands bound to the ceiling in the hallway)
</p>
<dl><dd> Elena: We're in my high school?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: They have plenty of restrooms, no flammable surfaces, and everyone's on winter break...Still. You know, it's no wonder America got dumb while I was locked up; they're never in school. (Looking at pictures in the trophy case of the cheerleading squad; grinning) Is that you? Oh, and there's Bonnie. You guys look so innocent. Smiling, like nothing bad could ever happen to you. 
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena is trying to pull herself free while Kai is distracted)
</p>
<dl><dd> Kai: (Straightens and looks back at Elena) Anyway, do you mind if I try to turn your blood into acid again?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: (surprised) Again?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: (taking off his jacket) Yeah, that's uh, that's kinda how you got here in the first place. (throws his jacket on the floor) I was trying the whole acid-blood thing and I think I burst a few important capillaries in your brain, because you blacked out.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Kai, you don't have to do this. Listen to me, you don't have to do this.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: <i>Phasmatos navaro pulsus sanguinox</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Ow!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: <i>Phasmatos navaro</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Stop! 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: <i>Sanguinox</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: (looks at her ring in horror as it melts) My ring. Kai, you're melting my ring.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: <i>Phasmatos</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Kai, stop it!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: <i>Navaro pul</i>--
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena finally pulls herself free, bringing the lights crashing down. She runs into the closest room, which is a chemistry classroom; Kai slowly follows, annoyed)
</p>
<dl><dd> Elena: No, no, no, no. No, no, no. (reaches sink and rinses off her hand; her ring is gone) No. No.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: Take it that ring meant something to you? (Elena looks around for something to use against Kai) I never understood sentimental attachments to things, because then it's so upsetting when you lose them.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena puts her hand in the sunlight until she catches on fire, then uses the gas from the chem lab with the fire and the fire hits Kai. Elena takes the chance to run through another door in the classroom)

<dl><dd> Jo: That doesn't count. I was distracted.

<dl><dd> Damon: (to Liv) Are you wearing my shirt? (Liv smiles at him; Damon's phone rings) Magic camp. How may I help you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: (back at the high school on a school emergency phone; frantic) Damon, Kai has me at the high school. I need your help.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Damon: Whoa. Elena?
</dd></dl>
<p>(Crashing. Elena hangs up and runs to the door, but when she opens it, Kai is standing there. Elena falls backward)
</p>
<dl><dd> Kai: (trying to break Elena's neck, but keeps moving other things around instead; Elena is crawling backwards away from him) Really? (Kai walks toward Elena and tries again, but knocks over something else) Dammit. (Elena gets up to run, but Kai finally succeeds in breaking her neck. Kai does a victory fist and walks to stand over Elena) Bingo.

<p>(Caroline and Stefan are walking through an art exhibit)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (she has her cell to her ear, on hold) So your friend I've never heard of is a world-famous photographer?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Well, it's a student exhibition.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Oh, goody. Freshman art. Since you're so good at noticing untapped potential. How do you know this person again? (someone talks to Caroline on the other end of the line) Oh! Yes, I did call earlier about a consult with Dr. Moore? Great. (to Stefan) Okay, they can see us right now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: You know what? I'm gonna catch up.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Okay. Uh, Oncology Center, D4. Come find me. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Okay. (Caroline turns and leaves the room; Stefan approaches one of the instructors) Excuse me. Can you point me to Sarah Nelson's exhibit?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Instructor: (smiles) Far corner. Good choice: She's one of our best new students.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Thank you.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan walks over to where Sarah is talking with a group of people, explaining one of her photographs)
</p>
<dl><dd> Sarah: According to the saying, when a child dies, an angel will take the child in her arms and fly her over all the places she loved best, so she can see them one last time before she goes to Heaven. That's what I had in mind with this aerial point of view. And then I wanted to catch the sunlight flaring off the windows because it obscures the reflection of the viewer who's looking down at them.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Good stuff. 
</dd></dl>
<p>(Stefan turns to see Enzo standing beside him)
</p>
<dl><dd> Stefan: What are you doing here?

<dl><dd> Caroline: (walking beside Dr. Moore) And that's when I read your article in the "New England Journal of Medicine." You know, the one about tumor reduction using hypothermia treatments?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Dr. Moore: That's not exactly light reading.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Well, I didn't say I understood it. (laughs nervously) These are my mom's charts. Look, your bio said that you are an amazing expert on glioblastoma and I really, really need an expert because my mom's doctors are telling her that she's not a cadidate for clinical trials. (looks into the doctor's eyes, compelling her) And you're not gonna give me any grief on insurance or confidentiality or anything except your honest opinion.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Dr. Moore: (looking over Liz's charts) Her doctors are doing everything right. It's a Grade IV tumor. They could try full-brain radiation, but that would seriously impact any remaining quality of life. She'll face cognitive and verbal decline, motor loss, personality change, and meanwhile, she could still develop morphine-resistant pain. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: So, you're saying that there's no feasible medical solution?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Dr. Moore: I really wish there were. I have a patient in nearly identical condition. He hasn't responded to any treatment. Now, he's just running down the clock. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: I want to see him.

<dl><dd> Elena: Nice shirt.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: Well, thanks. Yeah, somebody burned my other one. Which was awesome, by the way.

</p>
<dl><dd> Kai: I am starting to see why Damon digs you. You are crazy-pants. Oh, it sucks about that shirt, though.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: So you can care about an inanimate object, but not the people that you kill?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: Oh. (takes a drink of soda) Is this going to be like an episode of "Ricki Lake" where I come face-to-face with my demons and change for the better?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Elena: Have you really not cared about anyone?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Kai: (looking nostalgic) I guess I liked my brother, Joey. We played Dr. Mario together and he'd always win. Actually, one of my favorite memories is when I finally beat him (Kai and Elena both are smiling slightly). Of course, my <i>favorite </i>memory is when I finally beat him to death.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Elena stops smiling and looks disgusted)
</p>
<dl><dd> Kai: You don't have to waste your energy trying to change me. If Ricki taught me anything, it's that liking yourself is the most important thing. And I like me.

<p>(Outside, Damon and Liv pull up to the school)
</p>
<dl><dd> Liv: To think, a day almost went by where I wasn't roped into saving one of your friends.

<dl><dd> Enzo: (shrugs) I only came to see what you were up to today. I hate unanswered questions and you've left me with a few. Such as, what secret did you need to protect by letting me kill that pitiful con artist pretending to be your long-lost relative, Sarah Salvatore? So, I followed you, in your inconspicuous red Porsche off the exit to Chapel Hill, and here we are. Sarah Nelson's photography exhibition.

<dl><dd> Stefan: Why do you care?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Enzo: Well, it seems that Damon is unaware that the branches of his family tree might extend beyond just you. Call me old-fashioned, but I disapprove of secrets between brothers. So, I'll just go tell Sarah what your name is and--

<dl><dd> Stefan: What do you want me to tell you, Enzo? That the girl's my relative? Fine. She is Zach Salvatore's daughter, which makes her my great-niece 4 generations removed. I took her mother's body to the ER after Damon killed her. They did a C-section to save Sarah's life, but I kept that little detail from Damon so that she could live a good life in a nice home, where she felt safe and loved. That's my big secret.

<dl><dd> Stefan: You wanna tell Damon that I've been lying to him for the past eighteen years? Go ahead, be my guest. Maybe he'll hate me or maybe he'll realize it was the best thing I could have done for everyone. But either way, once you tell him, you'll have nothing left to obsess about.

<dl><dd> Stefan: (jokingly) I tell you this secret I've been keeping for 18 years, and that's what you're worried about?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: No, I think it's incredibly noble that you've been keeping an eye on her all these years. And she's lucky to have you in her life, even if she has no idea. 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Hey, so, I know it goes without saying, but I would appreciate it it--
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Your secret's safe with me, Stefan.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Stefan: Thank you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: No, thank you. Thank you for coming with me today and for rewiring my mom's speaker system and for just not treating me like a crazy person, because that's how I've felt these past few days. (Stefan takes her hand; they both look at their hands, then into each other's eyes; Caroline takes a deep breath and exhales) So, thank you. Wish me luck.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Caroline turns and goes inside; Stefan watches for a moment through the window)
</p><p>(Matt is on the couch; Liz is in her chair. They both turn when Caroline comes in)
</p>
<dl><dd> Matt: Hey, there you are. We were just about to watch another movie.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: How was Duke, sweetie?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: It was good. It was really good. Thanks for staying with her, Matt.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Matt: Anytime. See you soon, Sheriff.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: Okay, Matt. Bye.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (Matt heads for the door) Bye. (Caroline takes off her coat and puts it on the couch with her purse) So I met with that expert at Duke today. (Caroline sits on the coffee table in front of Liz) And she said that your doctors are doing everything right. And she also said that there is nothing that they can do to cure you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: (looking disappointed, but obviously trying to be strong for Caroline) That is one doctor's opinion.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: Waiting for more medical opinions isn't going to change this. You're dying, mom. And we're out of options. Which is why I gave my blood to a cancer patient today. And I healed him.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Collin Phelps is laying in his bed, asleep)
</p>
<dl><dd> Caroline: He was dying and my blood <i>healed</i> him. (Liz looks shocked) Look, I'm immortal and you're not. And I always knew that I would lose you one day, but I am not ready to lose you now. You're supposed to be here for my college graduation; we're supposed to argue about flower arrangements for my wedding. We're supposed to have years and years worth of birthday dinners and Christmases and white-water rafting trips. (Caroline is on the verge of tears) I want all of that. I want you to live for <i>me</i>. And I know that that's selfish, but that's the truth.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Liz: (crying) I want that too, honey.
</dd></dl>
<p>(Collin opens his eyes)
</p><p>Caroline: Okay.
</p><p>(Collins starts coughing)
</p><p>(Caroline bites her hand and drips blood into Liz's tea)
</p><p>(Collin is coughing harder now; he gets up and staggers over to the window, where he coughs up blood)
</p><p>(Liz takes the cup)
</p><p>(Collin is now on the floor, still coughing up blood)
</p><p>(Liz drinks the tea)
</p><p>(Collin is lying on the floor)
</p>
<dl><dd> Collin: Somebody, please! Help me!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Caroline: (to Liz) Everything's gonna be okay.
</dd></dl>
<p><b>END.</b>
