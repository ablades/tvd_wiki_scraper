</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: What is that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VICENTE: My tattoo you keep asking about. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He sets down the charcoal and gives Rayna a closer look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VICENTE: <i>La Marca del Cazador.</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: "The Hunter's Mark."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VICENTE: I traced it down to the line.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: How come I can't see the real one?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VICENTE: Because the mark is only visible to the Brotherhood of the Five.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: When do I get mine?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Vicente kisses Rayna on the forehead]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VICENTE: Hopefully never. If I do my job right, you will live in a world without bloodsuckers. Now, get up. I made stew.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: No. I will not eat. Not until you teach me how to fight.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Vicente pulls out the Phoenix Sword with a smile and hands it to Rayna]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VICENTE: This should be about the right size for you.

</p>
<dl><dd> VICENTE: Don't just look at it. Prepare yourself.

</p>
<dl><dd> VICENTE: Battles are won in the mind. If you do not believe you can beat me, you never will. <i>[Vicente defeats Rayna] </i>This is no game, Rayna. You want to survive? Show me you want to survive. And never hesitate. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[They go again and Rayna emerges victorious. Rayna has a proud look on her face when a horn blares in the distance.] </i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VICENTE: Vampires.

<p><i>[He quickly prepares to go to battle.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: <i>[worried ]</i>It's coming from Saint Malo. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She turns and walks up to her father]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> RAYNA: Let me go with you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VICENTE: Not today, Nene. This is my burden. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[He stands to his feet with a bag of wooden weapons.]</i>

</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Easy, Love. You're just gonna hurt yourself.

<p><i>[Rayna looks Enzo in the eye and continues to punch the glass until her hand bleeds. She turns and walks away from Enzo. Enzo speaks to his companion] </i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Right. We're going to have to sedate her.

</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: That's all the bourbon.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KRYSTAL: Vodka, you're up. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She pours two glasses as Damon throws down the empty bottle. He sits down looking guilty as Krystal dances over to the fireplace with the glasses of vodka.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> KRYSTAL: You want a Bloody Mary? <i>[Reads off a blood bag.] </i>Or a Bloody... Pamela? <i>[Laughs and pours into one of the glasses.] </i>AB negative. Very rare...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[A car alarm chirps outside and Damon immediately reacts with worry. He speeds over to the speaker and turns off the music.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You got to go.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KRYSTAL: No, we're dancing.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon quickly collects Krystal's clothes off the floor and a chair.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No, we are not. <i>[Hands the clothes to a confused Krystal and leads her outside the room.] </i>You. Leave. Now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> KRYSTAL: What are you... ?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'll call you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Krystal is led toward the back just as Bonnie enters the house from the house. Damon waves hello.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I need a drink. And a buddy. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She walks into the room Damon and Krystal were in earlier.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: And currently you are my only buddy available to drink. You'll notice I'm overlooking the fact that you nearly killed me the last time we hung out, so thanks for that. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie picks up an empty bottle of bourbon and looks at it in shock]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Are you out of bourbon? How's that possible? 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She sets down the bottle]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Someone celebrating Julian's very timely demise? 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon looks at Bonnie with surprise]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Stefan didn't tell you? Put a chair back through his heart.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon puts on his shirt and smiles weakly, still clearly worried about everything that has happened recently but not wanting to alert Bonnie to what is wrong]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: That's an oldie but a goodie. Hope he has enough chairs to take out the rest of Julian's backup dancers.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're too <i>debauched</i> to even notice he's missing. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She picks up the bottle of vodka and pours herself a glass]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Anyway, on the subject of people who have gone missing, when was the last time you spoke to Enzo?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Um...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Because yesterday, I got dragged into a very bad <i>L Word</i> rerun, starring Nora and Mary Louise, so we could track down Rayna Cruz, the big scary huntress... who, by the way, turned out to be eighty and senile... when all of a sudden, Enzo shows up out of nowhere and steals her corpse. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She sits down on a chair and finds Krystal's jean skirt underneath her. She pulls it out and holds it up for Damon to see as she gives him a pointed look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: What is this?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Um... 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: And don't tell me it belonged to Carol Lockwood.

</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hey. Sorry it took so long to get back, but Damon... 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan sees Caroline's unconscious, mostly desiccated body laying in her bed and begins to panic as he rushes toward her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Caroline. Caroline... Caroline. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The desiccation is slowly spreading to her face.]</i>
</p><p><i>[The scene cuts to a team of surgeons preparing Caroline's body for a C-section. Stefan looks worried and knocks a chair across the hall as Valerie walks in with two coffees.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Perhaps this isn't the best time to mention they ran out of cream? 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She gives Stefan a coffee]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Sorry.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Don't be. You have every right to be upset. What did you tell them?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Oh, I compelled the doctors to ignore all things medicine couldn't explain.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Good. I compelled a doctor to shut down this entire wing, so it's just us. Didn't want a vampire C-section to draw too much attention. Has she regained consciousness?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: No, not yet.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I gave her my magic. I stopped the desiccation.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[Sighs] </i>I knew she was sick, but I left anyway. It almost killed her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: And what were you going to do? Allow Damon to get his head ripped off in a bloody fight ring? Your brother needed you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[angrily]</i> My brother doesn't care about anyone or anything. He made that exceptionally clear yesterday.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Have you talked to anyone else about what he did to Elena?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Entire drive home, I was trying... to figure out a way to tell Caroline. And I just couldn't find the words.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: Look, right now, all you need to worry about is inside that room. Caroline's going to have the babies. Everything will be fine. And all this will be over.

<p><i>[Bonnie is still sitting in the armchair in Mayor Lockwood's study, where she's teasing Damon about his recent hook-up]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't quite hear that. Was that Cr... Crys... ?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Krystal.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Crystal.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Krystal.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Got it.

<p><i>[Damon throws the jean skirt on the floor]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: 'With a "K."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Krystal with a "K," hmm. Sounds like pure class. With a "K."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Go ahead, let it all out, Bonnie. I'm a vile cheater. I couldn't even wait a year.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Are you kidding me? 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[She gets up and walks around Damon]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: The last thing anyone wants to deal with for the next six decades is a cranky, bitter, <i>sexless</i> Damon Salvatore, okay? Elena would never do that to us, which is why she gave you very clear instructions to live your life. And apart from your glaring lack of standards, this isn't a bad thing.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon's phone rings. It's Enzo. The scene starts cutting back and forth between the Lockwood Mansion and Whitmore College]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hey, heard you got a thing for the grannies.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Huh, hilarious. I'm looking for Bonnie. She's not taking my calls.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Hold, please. <i>[He offers the phone to Bonnie] </i>It's for you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Tell him I don't deal with shady old-lady corpse stealers.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[To Enzo] </i>I'm sorry, she's busy. I'm gonna have to take a message.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: I'm looking for Rayna Cruz's sword. Let's just say that it's beyond urgent.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[to Bonnie] </i>He wants the sword.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Of course he does. 'Cause shady people like shady tchotchkes. It's not happening.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[to Enzo] </i> Did you get all that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Does Bonnie know what you did to Elena? 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon has a worried look on his face while Bonnie takes a seat on the couch.]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: How you incinerated your true love while she slept so soundly inside her casket? <i>[Damon is silent.] </i>Yeah, I'll take that as a no. Reckon that's wise. Oh, imagine if your precious Bonnie found out that you gave Elena a Viking funeral. It'd most certainly shatter that fragile and somewhat creepy "frenemy" thing you two have going on. Get the sword, bring it to me at Whitmore, or your best friend knows the truth.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, both horrified and worried, hangs up the phone and looks at Bonnie with a desperate expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: So here's the thing, Bon-Bon...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: What?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'm gonna need a... huge favor.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: You don't have a few hours. Caroline's stable, but the doctor needs to perform the C-section now.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric looks terrified as he tries to process this information]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Okay, yeah, I-I-I-I-I get it. Just do what you have to do. But promise me you've got the best doctors in Virginia.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> NURSE: Doctor, are you all right?

</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: No, don't touch that. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The heart rates return to normal]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> VALERIE: I think the babies want to stay where they can keep feeding off Caroline as a source of magic. I don't think they want to be born.

<dl><dd> JULIAN: I commend you for your valiant, but ultimately futile effort. That was tragic you were unable to save even one of these people. Might've given your death some meaning.

</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: You are one of The Five?

<dl><dd> RAYNA: If you kill him, you'll be afflicted with the Hunter's Curse. Plagued by madness and driven to take your own life.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Well, that does create quite a conundrum. If I spare your life, then you'll never cease trying to end mine.

<p><i>[Julian turns back to Rayna]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> JULIAN: Oh, I have another solution. I will not kill your father. <i>You</i> will.

<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[scoffs]</i> What are you talking about? I'm not gonna leave her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I'll stay and help Valerie. Damon <i>needs</i> you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[angrily]</i> I don't care what Damon needs!
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie looks horrified by the reaction from Stefan, and she stares him down intensely]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: I don't know what he did to make you <i>hate</i> him, but he is so determined to make things right, he's gonna get himself killed. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks torn, and Bonnie gives him another sharp look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Do you honestly think I would do anything to put Caroline at risk?
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Out in the adjacent hallway, Rayna has just lunged at Damon as he jumps to his feet, and he grabs a nearby oxygen tank, which he uses to hit her in the head so hard she spins backward and lands in a heap on the floor, causing her blood-stained Phoenix Sword to slide down toward the other end of the hallway. She quickly crawls over to grab her sword, just as Damon approaches her and prepares to hit her with the oxygen tank again. However, before he can swing it, she kicks him in the thigh so hard that his leg breaks, and he falls backward and slides toward the near end of the hall]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Meanwhile, Alaric has just arrived to the operating room, looking winded and exhausted, and looks around at Stefan, Valerie, Bonnie, the unconscious Caroline, and all of the surgeons in confusion and shock]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: What the hell is going on here?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie gives Stefan a determined look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Stefan, <i>go</i>. We can take it from here.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan looks torn, and looks over at Caroline with worry. Valerie nods at him in encouragement before he finally turns and leaves]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Out in the adjacent hall, Rayna has just risen to her feet and is walking over to Damon, who is still laying flat on his back on the floor where she pushed him. When she goes to stab him with her sword, he kicks the blade out of her hand before kicking her in the stomach so hard she staggers backward away from him, losing her balance and falling face-first onto the floor and giving him the chance to stand to his feet]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[In the operating room, Bonnie and Valerie are now casting the spell while Alaric stands at Caroline's bedside and watches the heart monitor with concern]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE &amp; VALERIE: <i>[chants] Venis ad vitur. Venis ad essendier. Factuo partis viventia... </i>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric anxiously looks at the surgeon while she works]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: How we doing?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> SURGEON: <i>[nods]</i> Almost there.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Back in the hall, Rayna and Damon are now fist-fighting since Rayna has since lost track of her sword. She quickly gains the upper hand, breaking his bones badly in order to incapacitate him long enough to grab her sword again. Once she does, she heads back to where Damon is kneeling on the floor, and he looks at her with a devastated, defeated expression]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: You want to send me back to hell? Let me tell you something, lady. I'm already there. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Rayna is not at all deterred by this statement and rears up to stab him in the heart, and Damon closes his eyes, almost relieved to be sent back to the Stone. However, when she thrusts her arm forward, Stefan vamp-speeds in front of him, causing Rayna to stab him in the shoulder with her blade, missing his heart. Damon looks horrified when he realizes what has just happened as Stefan groans in pain]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Stefan...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan shoves Rayna in the chest with his hand before kicking her backward so she slides to the other end of the hall. When Stefan realizes the implications of what has just happened, he's transported to a flashback montage of various important events to Stefan's life and his current situation. First is the scene of the two of them falling onto the forest floor when they dug up the original Ms. Cuddles in <a href="/wiki/The_Day_I_Tried_To_Live" title="The Day I Tried To Live">The Day I Tried To Live</a>. It then cuts to when Caroline confesses her true feelings for Stefan in <a href="/wiki/Day_One_of_Twenty-Two_Thousand,_Give_or_Take" title="Day One of Twenty-Two Thousand, Give or Take">Day One of Twenty-Two Thousand, Give or Take</a>]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>  CAROLINE: <i>When I'm with you, I'm happy.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The flashback cuts to a quick montage of Caroline and Stefan's kisses, including their makeout session while without their humanity in <a href="/wiki/A_Bird_in_a_Gilded_Cage" title="A Bird in a Gilded Cage">A Bird in a Gilded Cage</a>, and when they had sex in <a href="/wiki/I_Carry_Your_Heart_With_Me" title="I Carry Your Heart With Me">I Carry Your Heart With Me</a>. Next is their conversation in <a href="/wiki/Cold_as_Ice" title="Cold as Ice">Cold as Ice</a>, just before Lily's death, when Stefan and Caroline were talking about her pregnancy on the phone]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>I totally get it if you want to run for the hills.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>I'm not going anywhere... Because I love you.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The flashback then briefly cuts to Stefan and Caroline looking sad after Stefan's confession about his time in the phoenix stone in <a href="/wiki/Things_We_Lost_in_the_Fire" title="Things We Lost in the Fire">Things We Lost in the Fire</a> before it cuts to a flashback from earlier in the episode, when Nora was talking to them before she, Mary Louise, and Beau fled from Rayna]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> NORA: <i>Once a vampire's been marked, she'll chase you to the ends of the earth.</i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[In the present, Stefan looks at a horrified Damon, tear in his eyes, and gives him a terrified look after he sees the X-shaped cut on his left breast from where he was stabbed by Rayna. Damon looks absolutely devastated by what has just happened, and Rayna appears to have vanished]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[whispers]</i> I'll see you, brother.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon stares at Stefan in horror as he vamp-speeds away]</i>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Meanwhile, in the operating room, Bonnie and Valerie continue to cast their spell, and Alaric watches anxiously as the surgeons prepare to deliver the babies]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE &amp; VALERIE: <i>[chants] Infantesi mortuous venis ad vitur venis ad essendier...</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> SURGEON: Okay, now's our chance. The first baby is ready. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[The surgeon struggles for a moment before lifting out the first baby, holding it up so Alaric can see it. Alaric gapes in shock at the sight of his newborn daughter as one of the nurses takes the baby to clean her and weigh her, allowing the surgeon to birth the second baby]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> SURGEON: And now for baby number two.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[At the sound of the first baby's whimpering and crying, Bonnie cracks her eyes open and gives Alaric a hopeful expression while the surgeon pulls out the second baby and hands her to another nurse to check out. Alaric smiles the most genuine, happy smile he's had in a very long time, and Bonnie can't help but smile as well as the surgeon brings the first baby, which has been cleaned up a bit and wrapped in a blanket, over for Alaric to hold. She seems to be sleeping and sucking on her lower lip, and Valerie and Bonnie both look amazed]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Is she okay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: <i>[smiles]</i> Yeah, She's okay. They're both okay.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Valerie and Bonnie both smile as Alaric giggles happily]</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WHITMORE_COLLEGE_2"> WHITMORE COLLEGE </span></h2>
<p><i>[Damon, still devastated by what has just occurred, has returned to Alaric's classroom to find that Enzo is still bound to a chair in the back row with vervain-soaked ropes. Enzo sounds impatient and annoyed as Damon glares at him silently from a chair in the corner]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Are you going to untie me?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: It's tempting. The ropes make it easier to kill you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: You're gonna kill me? Look, mate, I assure you that giving Rayna Cruz the Phoenix Sword was not on my list of things to do today.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon stands to his feet and scoffs in exasperation and anger]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Really? You know what was on my list of things to do today? Buy more bourbon. That was it. That was the most <i>stressful</i> part of my day. And then you blackmailed me and screwed me into this scavenger hunt, and now my brother's paying the price!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[sighs impatiently]</i> Rayna gave me no choice.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No choice?! That's an interesting notion. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon pulls a coin out of his pocket]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: I'll tell you what. Why don't we let fate decide what happens? Heads, you live. Tails, you don't.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Before Damon can flip the coin, Enzo interjects with a huge bombshell]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Elena's alive.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon gives Enzo a cold, unimpressed look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: No, sir, she's not. I watched her burn with my own eyes.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: No, you weren't of sound mind. You were hallucinating. You saw what you wanted to see.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon doesn't seem to want to believe what Enzo is telling him if it means getting his heart broken again, but part of him is still hopeful that Enzo is being truthful]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Really?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo gives Damon an exasperated look]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Tyler thought it best to have an empty decoy coffin.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[skeptically]</i> So now you and Tyler are a dynamic duo?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: Let's just say that we have... <i>mutual friends</i> who have the real coffin and the real Elena.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon pauses for a moment to process this revelation before he replies with a serious demand]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Take me to her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ENZO: <i>[smiles]</i> She's in New York, where my friends are keeping her very safe and very much alive.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Enzo seems genuinely happy to be giving Damon this good news, and after a moment, Damon smiles in relief]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Good.
</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WHITMORE_COLLEGE_MEDICAL_CENTER_3"> WHITMORE COLLEGE MEDICAL CENTER </span></h2>
<p><i>[Bonnie is blotting Caroline's damp forehead with a washcloth when she finally stirs awake. As soon as she realizes where she is and what has happened, she begins to frantically ask questions]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: What happened? Are they out? Are they okay?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie smiles at her weakly before telling her what she knows]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: Everything's fine. Babies are healthy, they're with Alaric. He took them to the nursery to get them checked out.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: They're okay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> BONNIE: <i>[smiles wider]</i> They're better than that. They're beautiful.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline looks around, and when she doesn't see Stefan, she gets concerned]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Where's Stefan? What happened?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Bonnie takes a deep breath and makes a face that indicates she's not going to like the answer]</i>
</p>

<p><i>[Stefan is driving away from Mystic Falls when he gets a phone call from Damon and answers it]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Where are you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[annoyed]</i> Not where I'm supposed to be, which is with my girlfriend who just gave birth. Instead, I'm running from a hunter who won't stop chasing me until she's put down. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan sighs in anger and frustration before he continues]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Why did you hand over that sword, Damon?
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Damon, too excited about what he's just learned, ignores this question in favor of sharing his news]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> DAMON: Elena's alive.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: <i>[stunned]</i> What are you talking about?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> DAMON: <i>[sighs]</i> Long story with a hell of a punch line. I didn't kill her, Stefan. She's alive. I got a second chance, brother. And I <i>will</i> fix this. I will. I will kill that Huntress with my bare hands if I have to, and I will bring you back here, I promise. I promise you.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Stefan, slightly relieved by what he's just learned, nods in agreement]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I'm gonna hold you to that.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p><p><i>[Shortly afterward, Caroline is still in bed when she gets a phone call with Stefan to check on her, having presumably been filled in on what happened by Bonnie]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: Hey. How are you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[sighs]</i> Exhausted. Hungry. Lonely.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I'm sorry. I wish I could be there. This is the only way I could stop her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: I know. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline's voice is thick, as though she's about to cry]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: I just wish it didn't always have to be <i>you</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> STEFAN: I promise I will come back for you. I have to keep moving if I want to stay ahead of her. I love you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: I love you, too.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline sadly hangs up the phone and wipes away her tears, trying to pull herself together after all of the stressful events of the last few days. After a moment, Alaric walks into the room with the twins laying side-by-side in a wheeled cradle from the nursery. Caroline gasps and gapes in shock at the sight of them]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: Oh, my God...
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric smiles at her warmly]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: You want to hold 'em?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> CAROLINE: <i>[hesitantly]</i> Are you sure that's okay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: Yeah, Valerie said it shouldn't be a problem. Something about the umbilical cord... I don't know. I was a little distracted. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric hands her the first little girl, and Caroline looks at her in awe as she cradles her gently in her arms, gasping in shock at how perfect she is. The baby sucks on her lip and almost smiles as she dozes]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: This is Josie, in honor of their mother. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Alaric picks up the second newborn and holds her in his own arms so Caroline can see her]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> ALARIC: And this one... <i>[Alaric smiles and laughs under his breath]</i> This is Elizabeth... In honor of your mother.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>[Caroline clearly can't believe this news, and she starts to cry and laugh happily as she looks down at the little girl in her arms, overwhelmed by the sight of the babies she gestated for so many months]</i>
